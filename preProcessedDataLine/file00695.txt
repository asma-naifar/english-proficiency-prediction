my name is ..i'm fine. thank you.. , , no. i'm a housewife, and i work part time.. actually, i'm teaching english.. i teach english in the evening..   i work for   english conversation school. and  it's  one of the biggest schools in japan. and  i teach  high school students, college students and business people and housewives. . but i mainly teach adults. . and i only teach  students who are in the basic level. . but it is very fun...    the best thing about my job is  to meet many people, and  i like to communicate with various kinds of people. and  i can feel i can help people  by teaching english. that's the best thing. and the worst thing is   that it takes too long to prepare for each class. . and i'm not paid very , i guess. yeah. it's a fun job, but  it takes long time to prepare. .   that's the point i don't like about ..  yeah, of course my english is not perfect. so sometimes   i'm asked questions  that i don't know the answer of the questions. . and sometimes some students have  a trouble to communicate with others. so it's sometimes difficult for me   to manage the class. my class is  quite small,  only three  four people. . but they are adults. . so it's sometimes very difficult to  manage . i don't have any particular  hobbies. but   i like listening to music. . so when i have a free time, i go to a   c d rental shop, and rent some c ds, my favorite songs. and i listen to  the music at home. and sometimes i go to karaoke with my friends.. yes. i live with my husband, and my husband is very  outgoing person. and he likes outdoor activities. so i sometimes go hiking with my husband. and actually,   my husband and i climbed mount fuji this summer. . it was a great experience for us.o k. .  see. i think this is a picture of  the place in the suburbs. and  there is a  house,  it's a quite big house. . and  let's see, in front of the house, there is a street. and   i think it's  early in the morning. a man is jogging, and some children are playing  with a ball. and i see some dogs. and some people are standing and chatting with  their friends. . and    i see a car in front of the house. and there is a cat on the roof of the car.excuse me?.. let me see.    i live on the  very busy street. and i live in the apartment. . so my place is  much more crowded than this place. . and my streets are busier. there are more cars  on my  streets. . that's the main difference,  i think. o k.. hello, this is . . may i speak to?.i'm so sorry.   i couldn't make  your party. . and  i feel terribly sorry  that    i couldn't call you yesterday. .  i'm really sorry. and actually,   my mother called me last night, and she was terribly injured. .    she met   car accident. . she was o k now, but i had to go to the hospital. so i was  so upset last night. . and  i  had to go to the hospital. so i totally forgot to call you last night. i'm really sorry. . but  i was really looking forward to going to your party. so  if you have a party next time,  would you invite me again? i'm really sorry. but   it was a emergency, and i  had to rush to the hospital. and i was so worried about my  mother.. so  to tell the truth, i totally forgot about ... was it?. that's right.  i totally  forget that.  i'm really sorry.      i feel  yeah, so sorry. . but  i won't let this happen again. please forgive me.thank you.. i don't remember, but maybe yes. my friends are so nice. so they don't say anything to me. but  maybe i missed   appointment, or i missed the   yeah, engagement.  yes. i think so.parties?   , yes.i had a party.  that was my  friend's friend's  wedding party..  o k. .    is this man someone?make a story. o k. . one day last week,  my friend, taro, was driving his car. . he was enjoying his drive. and   o k,  one man was  riding his bike. and he was  talking on the cell phone while  he was driving the    motor cycle. . maybe he was talking  with his girlfriend or someone. and  that motor cycle  hit   taro's car. and the man dropped his cellular phone. . so  the man was quite upset. , and  he stopped his motor cycle. so taro stopped his car, too. and they had  argument.  . the man with the cellular phone was quite upset because his motor cycle was terribly broken. . let me see. but  taro  didn't agree with what the man was saying because taro thought  it was the man's fault because  the man  was so careless when he was driving his motor cycle. so  they decided to  call the police. and the police officer came. and taro explained the situation to the police officer. . he showed the  broken cellular phone  as an   evidence. . . and  taro told the police officer that the accident was the man with the cellular phone's fault. . and  so   the man driving the motor cycle  gave up discussing. and he called the garage. and the man from the garage came. and   the man  took his broken motor cycle to the garage. i have a driver's license, but i don't.  i took a driver's license in america when i was living there. and it was easy to drive in america because   the road is wide, and   yeah, it was easy. but in japan,  it's so scary for me to drive because  especially streets  in tokyo are very crowded. . and the traffic rules seem  very complicated. .. they are very dangerous, and they don't have  common sense, i guess.  out of question. yes.. first,  you have to realize that there are so many people around you when you are talking on the cell phone. and   you have to think about others. . some people might  be   annoyed by your cell phone. . so you have to think about people..  i'll go home. and   maybe i take a nap  for a while. and then i have to work in the evening tonight. . so  i'll prepare for the classes.that's right..
