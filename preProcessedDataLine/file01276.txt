yeah.  so   first time i visited  i mean england in nineteen-ninety-one as a student.and i studied fine art,  this college, . and it's a first time.  as i felt  very difference from  japan. it's a every culture and every life,   of course, language is completely different from japan. so i spent a lot of time to used to listen .  but finally, i enjoyed the stay in . yeah. yeah,   yeah, i studied fine art at college but i also play musicin . and    there's a big festival in club. and  art schools,   it's big organization of arts and music, and they invited me and my friends to play music there. so i played very   experimental music. and everyone enjoyed that very much. so  that was very impressive for me. yeah, it's a kind of synthesizer and making, yeah, .and more experimental things. so i just combine these sounds together. it's not very music but it's very beautiful for . yeah..yeah.  so this is a classroom.   the teacher is teaching mathematics on blackboard and it's a writing a graphs. but there are, one, two, three, six,   maybe seven, more than seven students in a class. but most of the people are chatting and ignores the what teacher is saying. but  only some students are very interested in that mathematic class, i think.  and the one guy  wearing yellow shirts is bubbling the gums. and the two girls are chatting each other without seeing the teacher at all. and the one guy is wearing a stripe shirt is listening a music with headphones with drinking some soft drinks. and yeah,  that's it.        mostly the class is boring and especially mathematics is very   it's not interesting, sometimes very difficult to under stand. and i think  in these ages,  the students are more interested in themselves very much. so  they are not watching  what the teacher's doing..  actually    i had a quite similar  as this picture. and     yeah, i like english and mathematics in a high school. but i didn't like  learning  chemicals and  japanese language class. so i didn't see  what they doing.  i just try to sleep on the desk. so i can guess what they are  about.yeah.yeah. .o k. .o k. .o k.      i bought a shirts and   pants  last week and  i brought it back to my home and weared it again. but it didn't fit to me very much, so i'd like to exchange these two items now. but   when i bought, i didn't fit  these two items in a shelf. and i ask some people  "can we exchange this?". but they said, "yes.". so that's why i just brought it back. because  all fitting rooms are very busy and there's a more than five people chewing. so i was very busy  you know, to the next appointment. so i couldn't have time. so i just talked to some people in there.yeah. she said o k.   i don't remember her name. . yeah. yeah, yeah, i think so. yeah.. so what can i do?
