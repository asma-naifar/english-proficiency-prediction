  actually, i'm in the sales accounting. so i do lots of  deskworks. . i do  many computers, so i don't often go out. so it's a bit stressful because always inside the office.   but peoples are nice in the office, so doesn't make me sick.but it's  stressful.... on weekends,   sometimes,    yeah, i go to the office, but, usually,  i walk around in the town, do some shoppings with my girlfriend,   go to movies, yeah,  to get some relaxation.not  specific hobbies, but do some shoppings.yes.? .  she is two years older than me. . .  how do i explain? . i think she is cute. . she has a black hair  about this length.  she wear glasses. she is either little bit big. she is  as tall as me,  maybe, about this size.  and she is very bright. she is   bright but   very  eager to be anxious. . so i always explain, "calm down. calm down". . she likes to eat many good foods. she likes to find   good restaurants. so we always go out to find some restaurants. she's    when i take  wines.  is that explain all?o k.o k.  i see the house   with gardens. i see   two boys playing volleyballs. it seems   this house is quite big with big gardens. . what's this? . i guess this is the cat on the car.  it's a very sunny day, and i think this is in a daytime. everybody's outside. . two womans are having a chat in the middle of the road. one of them   is with her dog. and there is a guy who is reading a newspaper     outside the house, actually, maybe because it's sunny.  i don't know. . there is a guy who's running in front of the house. .  it seems very  hot day, i guess.  .  ?.my area?.  my  neighbors?we don't have such kind of plenty of spaces. we don't have any gardens. we don't have any big roads. . so  i think, compared to my areas,   this areas shown the pictures is much more   easy to live, very comfortable live, i guess. actually, my area is more crowded with houses, more many cars.  but   i don't see any people who  will be reading newspapers outside his house because there aren't any spaces in front of his house . it's so tight. it's so crowded. so i think this is a , very expensive, i guess.o k?actually, i was born there. i have no choice.yes..o k. .o k. o k.yes. excuse me,  i have bought this   tape recorder  from your shop. . but, actually, i don't like it.because it doen't work well.. . i have done all the things on   what is said on the papers. so it should be working  well, but it doesn't work well. so, could you change to another new products?o k. even though it's not working well? i think   because i bought this tape, it should work well, because it otherwise i can't use this tape. so i think  it's not  very  good to say "it's only a policy.".is it?.. o k.o k.  can i use this  guarantee?
