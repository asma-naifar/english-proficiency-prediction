. . so so.  i mean  we have a three houses which i could  select the house so we looked  on the houses, and then we talked talk, talk, talk, about  around the some  convenience or  traffic or like  many things. and then  we decided to live the company house in .  it was the best choice, i guess. but  my husband always complained because   his office is little bit far from my home. so he always you know,   has to ride on a very  crowded train, and then   every morning, he has to leave for work  half past seven or very early morning. so  we are thinking about move to another place. but  you know company house is very cheap and very  large place so.  it's all right, yes. maybe in couple of years  we will live there..  what i do?  . now i'm just  housewife. i don't work. i just go to like   hobby or fitness gym or something like that.  i'm looking for a   job  which i think suit for me. but   just  very hard because  many of company set the limit of age. and then    i haven't asked the company yet, but  maybe  if i send my application or something like that, maybe the company thought i was just    older than other people who want to job. so  yeah, i try to find..  yeah.yeah.. pretty pictures..?all right. . this is  the girl's room. she has  one cat and one dog. and then  she is sitting in front of  her desk     which is    computer is on. and then  also she has a    no, no, no, c d cassette player with  speakers. and then  i guess it was june because i can see in a calendar of the june. then  at nine o'clock, i don't know in a morning or in a night, but   the clock said so. and    i don't know actually what she is doing. maybe she shows her screen to the someone or  her cats or . but  she just looks like  introduce something to someone. and  she also has a typewriter on a desk. and  she has her own phone on a shelf. .   . it's all right?no. . no.   no.no.yes, i have.  i think   it's a good machine to make communication with a person who lived in very far from here   like another country. why i think so because i have been in australia for three years. at that time,  i thought  international call  was very expensive. but  if i use a computer to send a  e-mail or  something, it's a very easy to very cheap. so  at that time, i thought " it's very great system.". .  just to send a letter, you know,  couple minutes or something. so just it cost  maybe one dollar or  half dollar or, i'm not sure. . yeah.yap.yap..  . it's very hard.  .  it is as for past?
