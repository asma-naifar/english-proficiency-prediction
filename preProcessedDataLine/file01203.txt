my name is   should i give you the last name or first name?first name. .right. please.fine, thank you. ?it is. it's quite pretty. it's a nice autumn day outside. i really enjoy it today.you mean in  or.  i came today from . do you happen to know where that is, ?, right. i stay there. over two month, about..all by myself.. actually, it's not quite  to say "all by myself" because i stay  in sort of  dormitory. to know where  the  is? you know, that  ? language education. should i say ? not .  to be here   an exchange researcher.   at this moment, i have two status. one is  being as an exchange researcher between  and then in my home university which is  i   given you in my  . i hope i could.  see i wanted to come over  to japan for longer period of time. i've been, as i told you before,  over twenty years in germany.   position at the university,  in . and i want to help in a research  over   the japanese   education and  i applied for this  taking a leave,     but my position does not have or   cannot be given this sort of sabbatical. so  i do have to    some apply for the  vacation, one-year leave,  no,  for which i was quite successful. because   on the one hand, i have   applied for the  so-called fellowshipin  japanese education and  fortunately i could receive one from the  .and   at the same time, i applied for this exchange researcher program between   and my home .and  again, concerning  the same theme. they do have here, this  japanese department, ?   department of japanese education..right.right.. ...actually   it's been over almost thirty  because i .what changed most? i would   say, first of all, the appearances of the  younger people and also behavior pattern.  can you relate to it? . . more specific. like  when left japan for  i said  thirty years ago, that was   actually seventy-three, so  exactly thirty years ago, right? i went to the states in order to, say, brush up my  english.  i wanted to learn. i was a  english teacher at  the junior high school. and   i was not satisfied with my proficiency, so  i went to brush up. and i went  to the states. and  there, i spent  four years and then  it happened that  you know, i've been to germany and i got to know my husband before then, i mean.  and i went to germany and it's been over     twenty-six years.     the biggest different i would say is like  the younger people    who can be very  creative, not all of them, some of them are still sort of uniformed way of thinking and  appearances. but still the  differences    say,    how should i describe it, in terms of the  not only appearance but the way they behave. like  having, you know,  brown hair or    as i've been calling "golden hair"   the younger people    color their hairs  which are allowed   as such.they wouldn't be  socially sanctioned, right? and  so this sort of freedom on the one hand in terms of the what they wear, and in terms of the  behavioral pattern, i would say,  people are quite permissive now. maybe the older generation cannot do anything against it. .. .and sort of this traditional way of japanese patterns which  can be called as   you know, quite typical  japanese   to see in that extent. so i would say this is   for me the   yeah, biggest   difference..o k.so       you mean  the whole picture  or ?  this is    the drawing concerns  probably a  apartment room for the  young lady  sitting in front of her computer. and  there's one big  window. and she has  probably two pets belong to her,  i guess. one is sleeping  right next to the bed. and on the bed,  she has a .  in germany,  i used to have   this  the catwith a long, you know, tail. and she's looking at this two pets and just  quite happy. and actually her  computer is now been  put on. she has two types of  writing system.  interesting. one is the   typewriter  next to  her computer. and i can also see at   the other side of the wall, she has this hi-fi system and underneath some box and calendar on top of it.and the door is open and i imagine that would be about the size of my room  which i have now  in . there's one clock  which is  nine o'clock, so i should describe both of them in the euclid word, . it's probably evening.o k.  in terms of this  my  say,  working room so now office below, i don't know what's in english  they call it, in german you say   room  looks like this exactly.      except the fact that i have whole bunch of books  here   to the top ceiling.and a cat. i don't have   dog but i have . o k.  should imake a phone call ?.  hi, . here's . are you?  you see, i'm calling you just at it's seven o'clock. and your party will  start eight o'clock, ?. you know, , sorry, i have to tell you that  one of my cat has just fallen down from the  fourth floor of my apartment, you see. and  i have to take her  to the doctor. i'm sorry about that. i really have to   go to the doctor  and see what happens to her, because it seems like that she has broken  you know,  her  yeah, left leg.     it looks like that it's quite serious, so  i'm sorry, i don't want to, you know, come quite late, nine o'clock or ten o'clock. it could be that she has to  have the  infusion  as i have experienced before.   so this is the case and i'm sorry that i can't come and i hope you will have fun with people, you know. . really sorry about that.  i don't think i can make it,  i'm afraid. so would you  please say hi to everybody and have fun. and then if do have any, you know, party the next time and i really  would like to come and i will bring some nice food from japanese-german style. so  please say hi to everybody and have fun. o k?i will. thank you .o k. .thank you.  it happened to my cat.   it was really terrible.    or  actually he is a strong cat. had fallen down as i'd said. i said fourth floor, but in    german  way of counting, it's  fifth floor, as you probably know. and  you know, just   when they are playing and  one cat fell off. was six years old.  is his name and  that was    one o'clock in the .   and i have to  take him  to the doctor. and it was quite  that i could take .and then     it took me about three hours to have this infusion. and then he   had to stay in hospital and then he was operated on.    i had to pay about eight hundred euros. .i don't know how much would that be. probably one thousand dollar, i guess at this moment. and i was so shocked and then i could have this infusion.  yeah.o k. ..one day last week, a   businessman called, say, he  must be then japanese man,  mister takagi went to the  station. and   he has to take his train. it is   eight-five. and it happened that he had  or just because     man standing right next to him          was his elbow  pushed him so that his bag, which was quite important,  fell off  right on the  rails in between. and it was behind it and he   wanted him to take it, but      the man next to him was quite mean, and he wouldn't take it, right? and then in the meantime, people were around   just watching them and it was quite embarrassing. but nonetheless he wouldn't do it. now, it happened  that the train came right .   this moment, and the  mister takagi thought, you know, ,  brief case? his case were beaten and just torn off. but  he was so relieved  so am i,  because  he had in his  briefcase the whole reports of   you know,  important business negotiation and he was so relieved. and the   man next to him was also nice enough   to share this .and then the  now  it happened that the     man working at the railroad, , i don't know,  would come up and then, you know, saved this briefcase and handed to him. and he was so relieved. and interestingly enough,  one man  was clapping his hand was different from the man next to him. but i don't know why    it happen quite often  in japan, and people  would watch it, but wouldn't  say anything, right?he could have  call or   call in the help  because  actually he was the one who was  responsible for this what happened. now  o k and then, you know,  but   everybody was satisfied and happy.so it was   happy end..i only have just a small  move from  to here. and actually i'm trying to find   ,  how to say,  how to call the cheap  transportation company.do you happen to know any? ..   which i've been told. i talk to the  at the   taxi  in front of that station. and they told about   one  yen and maybe i will take it or just a couple of stuff and then i would  imagine  take me about  one more week before i, ,   bring everything. .mostly box and computers and then printers and stuff.so     the only thing that   i would miss are.  no, no, no.. i don't have cats  my pet,   old, big and very nice, but   i don't know, .. ... nice .thank you very much.
