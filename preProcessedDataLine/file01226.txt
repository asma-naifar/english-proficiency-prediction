  i had a stomachache. i was in the . .i still don't know why i should pay  for the fare of the train i haven't been on.why should i pay for this ticket?yes. so i would like refund so i can buy a new ticket..  but i want my money back or i'd like another ticket. .i don't have the money.i don't have a bank account there.my parents are dead.can you help me, please? .traveling?  yes.  go quite around the world  in the future when i get job. i'd like to get a job which sends me around the place.i'd like to see  places.  and japan is a small place, if you compared it to the world.so i know that there is more things out there. i  want to see those things.      when it was the time to come back to japan,  my  friends held a party for me, .and  until then, i didn't really  think that friends were so valuable to me. but there were like friends that   cried for me.saying like  they were really upset that i was going back to japan. sothat was good, i suppose. yes. .o k. one day last week, a man in a orange car was driving along as usual.  then  when he was driving, a man on a scooter came along from the opposite direction. and he was  using his mobile phone whilst he was driving a scooter.  because the man using his scooter, he wasn't looking where he was going, and he hit the man in the orange car.  when the man on the scooter hit the orange car, he dropped his mobile phone. and his mobile phone broke. the man on the scooter claimed that   the person    who was responsible for this accident was the man in the orange car. so the man on the orange car called the police and told the police that the man on the scooter had been  using his mobile phone whilst he was in the scooter. and it was obviously the man on the scooter's fault that the accident happened.  so the policeman took a whole  notes down and he said that he would like to see both of them in court the next week.so the story ends and the man who was on the scooter watches his scooter being taken away for repairs.?. yes.bad points for  phone.     i use it between the lessons. it. it kind of encourage me not to listen to lessons  it just makes me kind of want to just look at my cell phone  talk to someone. yes. .but   they don't really care because   stop lessons just for one person   like "you shouldn't be using your cell phone.",   stuff like that. .  not much. .not in my classroom. no.  sometimes i'm talking to someone in kyoto. i have a friend in kyoto. . it's better than lessons. yes.  firstly i want to go to university.in japan, .yes.  and  i want to study there.  i was thinking about      the production of television. . yes.
