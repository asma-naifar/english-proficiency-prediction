.yes. my name is . sure.i'm fine, thank you. and you?.yes. but it's really cold, ?i like winter. but  i rather like   to be in warm place in winter. so i love to go to bali island.yes.. don't you know bali? but,bali is actually in indonesia. and   how can i say that, it's totally different culture from japan. and the balinese people actually believes the god. but their religion is  different from japanese one.   and actually that they really love to be in very quiet  state of mind. so i can really relax in bali island. and actually the weather is wonderful.   always like summer kind of weather.so it's very warm,and .and actually   always that there are a lot of flowers in bali island. so the smell is really nice. so i love to be in bali... just relax.   just read books. or reading books   and just go to the beach and sleep and have nice time.  .it's really safe. so you don't to need be   too much worry about  your safety.  but maybe just i don't have  enough knowledge. but   i feel safe in bali. so i haven't heard any kind of  serious trouble in bali.so i think  that's fine. ..my hobbies. . maybe it's a same thing. and duplicated  i like reading books.  and also i love listening music. and  because  i work a little bit busy in weekdays. so in the weekend,  mainly the purpose of my hobby is to relax. and be myself,and have my own time. . .. i like   miyuki miyabe. she is  novelist in japan. and she is very famous. she won several awards.  and  the reason why i like her book is because that        she can express her character and her personality into the characters in her books.so  i can feel her personality through her books. so i like reading her books. and also at the same time,     she is very good at  creating the story.       it sounds  average, but  usually that good story telling is very difficult. because   it is so difficult to creating the character in the story.so i think that,  because of both reasons that i love to read her books..i don't know. but   i assume that   she must be very warm and kind and also at the same time, she is very clever. because she can develop her story by herself.and  i think that creation is very  wonderful thing to see. if you don't have imagination that you cannot develop and create story. and of course, you cannot entertain people who read your books. so i think that she has a great power to entertain people. and at the same time, that she is very good at expressing herself into her books... yes. . just tell this picture?.  i think it's  in a french restaurant or . because i can see a lot of wine  in this picture. and a couple wears a very formal dresses. so i think that it's a kind of little bit expensive place  to be in here. and      there is a woman who is playing the piano in this picture. so, i assume that they have to pay a lot of money to be in here and enjoy wine.   and i think, yeah      one person is recommending the special wine, i think. must be expensive, .  and he wears a formal wear, too. and his dress  is   mainly black, very formal dress. and he has a white tie. and he is smiling. because this wine must be very expensive. so i assume that he is recommending strongly to drink this wine to him.  but actually that    the man   yeah  is sitting at the table is drinking a wine already. so maybe  it's my mistake that actually that he already orders this wine  from the person in a restaurant. and he  is also smiling. so, maybe he is  saying his comments to this wine. cause   i assume that he already tested the taste of this wine. and the girl next to him is also that the smiling. but maybe because she is nervous to be in such kind of expensive place.  and i can see the watch. and  the time is seven o'clock. and it must be at night. so in the night, the couple, maybe they are not so familiar to each other. because that if   they already develop the strong relationship each other, that  maybe they don't need to be in this kind of formal expensive restaurant. so i think that they are  very in a beginning of their relationship. or maybe this is the very  memorable day for them.. ..you're . need to describe  his clothes??. o k. .you are welcome.for me?.   i love to go to the japanese restaurant. and especially  not expensive one. like  very usual place.  but for me, that i love fish. so  i like to have very fresh fish,in japanese restaurant with good . .  i don't have enough knowledge about it.but i can taste it. so i have my   own favorite taste for . but it's quite difficult to explain.just  i like to have like  mild taste. ?o k. ....yeah.yeah..o k.yes.yes. . actually, i missed the train  which i had the reserved ticket for it.and  i know that   it's against the rule but could you please refund the ticket or can i exchange the ticket to the next train? is that possible?.. actually, please listen to me,   because   i have serious reason. because i don't have enough money    to have another ticket for the train.but actually, that i have to go to the wedding of my friend. and i cannot be late to the special day. and also that i have this ticket and i know that this is reserved ticket. but actually, that  i can be o k to stand    whole way long. so could you please exchange the ticket to the next train? i don't need a reserved one. .. actually, no. i'm sorry about it. but  i totally forget to have my credit card with me.no. i'm a stranger here. because  i came to here  just for his wedding party. so i don't have any friend in here. so i'm a totally stranger.  could you please? this is just one time and  i will not do it again. so please, ...  i have my i d, so you can just copies... no, because i'm a stranger. and i need to go back to home tonight. so you cannot keep it. but you can just take a copy for  to  confirm  my  identity. is that o k?.. actually, just  exchange is totally fine   i just  like to go to his wedding party on time. so if i can take the next train then, i really appreciate it..thank you so much. really, really appreciate it. very much.bye...  many times. because  i'm a troublemaker.  usually  it's very easy for me   to be lost in a totally  unknown places,so it's very common. .   it's totally unrealistic not to   not to get lost for me.    what is it, it's almost my nature,to forget about the way.how to get there   so    how can i say that, for me, that negotiations always happening for my all life.... sometimes  i make an effort.but usually that  i feel like maybe i'm o k in . . . .  you are like my mother.i feel like "yes, yes mother.". .....one day last week. o k. .. o k. . so   she is hanako.and hanako went to a department  one day last week.  and  she bought a necktie for his father  in the department store. and then, she     it's very short story.  is that o k?  o k.and   she bought it for him as a present for   his birthday.  and then that  hanako  found out that  there was a  final sale in the department store  for her shoes. and the discount level is thirty percent. so it was very attractive for her. but  i don't get that whether she bought her shoes or not from this picture. so i don't know what she did.   and then, the fortunately for her that the there was another sale for  no, no,  no, not dress, just  casual suits. and the discount level was fifty percent off.    and also at the   same thing that  i don't get whether she bought the  yellow shirt or not from this picture. but i assume that she was very happy to find out the thirty percent discount and fifty percent discount at the same day. so maybe it's a season of their sale for this department store.     but   i get it from the number six picture that she bought a lot of things. because that when  she  went into the department store, she had only one bag. but actually that   when she went out from the department store that she had  four bags  of this department with the necktie. so i can easily say that she bought a lot of things, maybe shoes, maybe shirt, maybe  skirt. i don't know. ..you are welcome..thank you very much.. .. no, i don't have any plan  unfortunately,     my future plan is actually i'm gonna get married in may. ... thank you very much.yes.happiest time? really?.  o k. . thank you .. yes.  i'm quite busy  for both the business and private, so, that it's the busiest time ..thank you very much.
