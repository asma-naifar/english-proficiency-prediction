my name is . ..yeah..  could tell me your name once again, please??o k..today?   i have to do a lot of things   at my house 'cause  i have to do  cleaning up my room and  i have to wash my clothes.  they are piled up. .and so forth.yes.? work?i'm working now at ?yeah. yes. about this ?yes.  i've been  teaching at this school about  ten years. and   this is the second school for me.and   there are a lot of beautiful trees around this school.  but the students are not so  motivated. . so i have to think about the contents of the class very   in order to involve the students  in the classes. so, yeah, everyday is a very hard day for me. .my classroom?  i'm in charge of  class now. . but  relatively, compared to the other classes, relatively the students     listen to what i'm talking to.   and  rather well disciplined. some of the students are a little bit selfish. but  they tend to listen to what i'm talking to   in a  very friendly way. . and i really like .yes.  probably, about   fifteen minutes     ride  on the car from school.. in  city? city? to tell the truth, i don't like  city.  i'd rather live in  the suburb of .'cause   i often go to   on holidays. so it's not so convenient for me to live around here. but   is a very traditional city. and  i went to   senior high school in . so,   yes,  there are a lot of  old castles and  shrines. but  ,  i don't like this city,so much... .    i sometimes go to . but  it's impossible for me to live around  , 'cause it's very expensive and  i'm working at   prefecture. so  it's very  inconvenient for me to  live in the center of .but just  i wanna have a convenient life. 'cause around my houses,   there aren't so many stores which attracts me, such as  stores and     side-dish stores.  i mean,  i'm quite busy. so  sometimes i can't prepare my supper.so i want to buy something  delicious. and  there is a    supermarket called inageya. but    the stocks which are sold there   don't attract me so much. so, i want to have a store   selling some delicious side dish to  decorate my  supper.yes.    three couples are having the, probably, dinner. . very gorgeous restaurant. and  one woman is playing the piano. and the time is seven o'clock. so         one waiter   is recommending one probably very expensive  wine to the  center couple. and     they already drink?  one of the men  has already   drunk wine. and probably     he was asking the name of the wine. so the waiter is explaining  what kind of wine it is. so  maybe   this man liked this wine. so   they seems to me that  they  really enjoy their   dinner .in a gorgeous restaurant...    i don't eat meat. so    i mean   i'm not a strict vegetarian. but  i don't eat meat. so  i'm looking for some  restaurants  which will attracts me. but   at the  present moment,  i haven't found such a   nice restaurant. but   i'd rather take some italian food rather than  the other foods. 'cause italian foods has  various kinds of menus,    which don't include meat. so  i love italian .. 'cause   there is some reasons for me.    and from  healthy point of view, it's not very good    for us who eat meat. and another reason is a religious reason.'cause if  the animals were killed and  when they were killed, they got lot of pains by killing. so if we eat meat,  we have to also get some burden      of their pain.so which cause  me some troubles in the future. so,i believe in that religious .so  i don't want to eat meat..role-play?yeah..this one?yes.. .ready.yes. i bought this  stuff before. but      excuse me for saying this, but   i don't really like this  goods. so   could you change  anything different  this?. really?.   to tell the truth,   i was really busy at that moment. so i don't have the  precise judgment about  the thing which i'm going to choose. so     what should i say, could you think of my    difficult situation? ?   there are lot of beautiful  stuffs   in your store. so  if i bought  more than this, could you accept this refund or  could you accept this   clothes once again, please??yeah. .she's out?o k.  when will she or he come back?tomorrow?so  i'm not sure i'll be able to come here tomorrow. but  so could i  call you back once again? and    let me check that    it's possible  for me to come back again? could i call you ?thanks a lot.yeah.yeah. .yeah.. .clothing?    my taste   is changing a little bit these days.  before, i'm a so-called   easy buyer. when i see something,   i tend to buy very quickly without thinking too much. but  i made a lot of mistake     by doing such kind of things.and these days, i try to choose something very  valuable and    the things which i willing to wear for long time  to makes me feel very  comfortable,  makes me look very chic, fashionable. so i want to buy  such kind of  valuable clothes these days.six pictures..o k.. could i speak of   as soon as possible or,?. o k. a man is driving a car  on the road. .   what should i say?  at the opposite end,  there is a man   who are driving motorcycle with a cellular phone and talking  with one of his friends. and   his friend is a girl. and      he is looking at the front very carelessly, 'cause he is concentrating  on using his cellular phones,  the motorcyclist. so   they nearly collide with each other. just   probably, a motorcyclist touched the  car. so   the  motorcyclist got angry, 'cause his cellular phones was broken by touching the car. but   the car's driver  also got angry. 'cause   the driver  thought that   the cause of the accident         it was to be blamed for the motorcyclist 'cause the motorcyclist  was using cellular phones. and a policeman  came. and          the policeman was taking some notes about the accident. and   the driver told the police that     the motorcyclist using a cellular phones.  so  the cause of the accident  was up to  him. and  probably, the motorcyclist was looking at his bike is    carried away     on the trucks. so he was   hopelessly looking at his motorcycles   going away..yeah. i  feel tired.restful evening? .o k.o k. without any plans, i , take a rest. .thank you very much.
