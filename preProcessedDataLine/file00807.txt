so the first, the golf club should be  the appropriate weightfor me. so  if the club is   too light,  the  golf swing is   not  going accurately. so the appropriate  weight is very important. too heavy is sometimes so    it's also not good. the point is  to choose the appropriate weight club, fitting to me. ...yeah.o k..o k... my story?o k. and using this pictures?o k. my story. o k.     yeah, one day last week,   i went to the station so nearby my house. so usually  i take a train from   this station. so when i was in the form of the station, so accidentally i dropped my bag. because  this guy  hit to   my hand.  so  i dropped my bag   on the rail of the train. so i complained to      yeah, this guy.  but suddenly the train came  into the form. so  i really afraid my bag will be crashed by train.but once the train   went away, so my bag was safe, no problem on the rail.  because  just below the train, so when train so  pass this station.  then i ask the people in the station so   to pick up my bag   in the rail of the train. so he kindly help me to pick up and  pass the bag to me.yeah.yeah... o k. .  i think  i would do the same thing. so     i'm afraid to pick up my baggage by myself. probably i ask somebody in the stationto pick up my baggage. . if this guy,        how do you call, is not careful,so about  his behavior like this. so since this is the very crowded situation, so everybody  have to behave nicely,so especially so like  you know, the gesture or this kind of behavior is not appropriate in the situation. but if this guy,   you know,  just   did accidentally,so probably i don't get angry like this.just, you know, say something.yeah... this afternoon? yes. i'm going to be busy. yeah. i have  three meetings..yeah.yeah. o k.. yeah.
