. my name is .yes, please. or just call me . yes.yes, fine. but a little bit nervous.  you can understand, i think.yeah.on friday, i am a housewife with two boys. and i  usually  do my  house  stuffs. and then,  if i have some job, i'm working as a part-time  interpreter and  part-time guide for foreign tourists. so, if i get some job, of course i would do some job, but  usually i would stay at home.. yeah.yeah. i was interested in  communicating with people. and i like to meet people and i'd like to help people. and especially tour guide job   encourages me to study  more about japan. and i'd like to introduce japan more. so, it's very  fruitful job for me.yeah. yes. of course. every time.    i call this job   accidental or i don't know what to call it,   it is  always   very  exciting but  sometimes  very exhausting, too.  because   there are not  only my fault but also   like   weather condition or the condition of the traffic. and, of course, the combination of the tour group. sometimes  very kind and sometimes they can be mean. but   i do my best to have a  better and more comfortable  atmosphere for them, so. so,     by the end of the day, i would be pretty exhausted, but i'm very   satisfied. .. yes.  i  should admit, i  think   i should not stay with them for such a long time. if i keep an eye on them, i start to   criticize.   i'd like to give more advice to them and     i don't think  it isn't  good  relationship between us. so, i think i should stay maybe a little bit far from them, and see them from outside occasionally. if i too close to them, it's not  good.yeah.yeah. over weekend.  of course, sometimes over weekend,  i get some jobs because     it's very   sometimes busy.  because tour    very busy over weekends, so. but  usually  i would stay at home and i take my boys to soccer field and i can be a soccer mom for them.  .yeah. . can i just start?yeah.  this is   i think suburb of the  some big town. and  it is a sunny,   warm day. and  it's probably autumn or  spring. the temperature is not very high,  so,  i could see a   person  jogging and another old  man  is sitting  on the beach reading a newspaper. and  there are housewives talking or chatting over something. and  a girl     is jumping rope. and    there are two boys   playing with a ball.   and i think it's a very peaceful . i think it's,  in a way, similar to my house area. yes. the difference.   there are several houses but  in my area, there are more    apartment or  condominiums.  and it's more   than our place, i think. ... . , i have to say something    bad for you.  actually i have to excuse myself for your invitation for the party.     i really wanted to go there. actually i was looking forward    to be there, you know. but  unfortunately,    one of my kids is sick now.  fever.yeah.    if   he can feel better, i wish i could go. but   his fever is    i think    quite bad. and i should   go ask for the doctor. and        i think  i should stay at home  for him tonight. and  yeah, maybe tomorrow,      i don't think the situation could go. .    but  this time i couldn't go but    if you have  something like this    please  just  call me again and   i'd like to be there. yeah. .yes.yes, of course.   if he is  staying at home. but   he's been very busy  lately. and  he said that  maybe   tomorrow, he will  have to go to his office  to catch up with his jobs. so, unfortunately, i don't think he will be here. and  i'm  terribly sorry that. .. yeah.  i told them that  actually i was going, so,  they might be disappointed.   but  you know, that      i wish this is  not the last time and i hope that you could make something else for us. .yeah, i will absolutely be there. i'm sure that. .yeah.yeah.thank you . hope so, too. yeah. .bye-bye. i try not to, but  yes, by my   children's   sickness or sometimes  by my job.  because my job  is not regular one, so, they may call me like  the day before. so,     sometimes i make some  excuse and  yeah, ..yeah.  so, i should start.so,  yeah. one day last week,   bobby and jane,   i think he's not  boy. .  jane and mary    were preparing for their camping. and  they were very excited. and   they checked what they were  going to bring     some stuffs and  they were ready. and when they arrived, the weather was  wonderful, so, they were having  very good time. at first, they had to, of course,   make a tent and   they were preparing for the meals. and     they had a good time over there. but all of a sudden, the rain started.   of course, they didn't expect. but they were very clever.   before the storm  would have come, they were ready   to leave. and actually their decision was right. . as soon as they  left over there,  without   cleaning up  their  stuffs, actually the storm came and the rain and the wind were getting worse. and   they arrived at the nearest hotel called hotel cosmos. and  it was  relief for them,   because they heard  a thunder. and  when they arrived and relaxed  with a cup of coffee,  the weather changed. and now  it is not so bad. but   it's still raining. so, it is such a hectic day, but  they were  relieved to be here,finally.. of course the preparation.  they need to prepare everything.  and  another point is, of course,   right decision,  immediate  decision. .    as soon as they decide, they should leave and    it can be emergency, so.yeah.no. . our family is not  that kind of  family, i think. we'd rather stay in the  hotel. and  especially my husband is not  outdoor person. he likes to sit and  just  relax in the hot bath and  enjoy good meal, so. but  i want to, sometime. yeah.yeah.. actually  i hope it would  become possible, but   this  summer, i'd like to  climb . and  as a guide, i went to mount fuji so many times. and  people ask me about    how is the temperature or how is the  atmosphere over there, but i couldn't answer them correctly. and      i really want to go there. yeah. with my two boys.yeah.  it should be  good experience for us. yeah..  this weekend,  starting from tomorrow. . tomorrow,    it depends on the weather. but if the weather is fine, i should take my boy to the soccer field  in the afternoon. but in the  evening, i have some  good appointment with my friend. so, i will go out with her. so, i'm excited.  yes.yeah.thank you..
