   the bike was not that problem.  but    it's usual thing but he was  mad at me, too.   we called the police, and  policeman came, and  the guy said, " he was talking on the phone and driving it.", you know? and, yeah,   after he said that, i couldn't say  anything, you know?  just standing and  doing nothing.   but i was so mad. but, after that,   the guy and policeman  went away, and  i was all by myself with my bike. but  i didn't know it was so bad, but i couldn't move any.  i needed to call  my jaf or something like that or  company. and my bike was gone with truck, and i was all by myself now. yeah.sure..in a train?they shouldn't use it, or,  you know, someone talks really loudly,and someone talks really . but,      if you didn't have time, or it's really important phone call,it's not bad to take it. you should say, that  "i'm in a train. i'm gonna call you back later, please.". so  they could understand it, you know?   and   it's bad thing  time goes first and business goes first and anything. , if you miss the, like, point,  they go away.  and   i don't know, but,   actually i don't turn off my mobile.   so  i don't know, it really affect to somebody. or,   actually, they shouldn't talk loud, or they shouldn't talk long just  brief note and say something or "i'll call you back later, o k, and please.".  they would understand. my friend does, so do i. yeah.sure..when?
