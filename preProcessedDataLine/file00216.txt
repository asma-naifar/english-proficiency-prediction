no? ?o k, i'm ready.  last weekend  i went to the theater with my  two friends.  one is   my university's friend and his girl friend.and  actually, i wanted to  watch the  love story but  they wanted to  watch a action movie. so  we decided to watch the action movie. and, before watching the movie  we bought  some drinks and popcorn  for   having fun time more. and  during  watching the movie   we had fun time  to watch the movie itself and   have a some drinks and  snacks. and   this movie was  very fun for us.  more than our expectation.  so   we satisfied  to    select  this movie.and, after that   we were going to have a dinner together. that's all..  usually  . i like to watch the emotional movie. so  i don't care about love story or action   movie or like that. so, because   some love story had emotional portion and also  some  action movie has emotional  portion. so, through the  movie  i can feel the emotional mind, so  i don't care about love story or action movie.  i want to watch just emotional movie. but, when i explain this picture  i thought it's easy for you to understand love story and   action movie. because if i  said  something emotional movie like that it's difficult  for me to explain later. that's why i said.o k .no..yeah.   i will go to mountain for skiing tomorrow.and, maybe i will   return to tokyo  in tomorrow, maybe.. thank you very much.o k, thank you very much..
