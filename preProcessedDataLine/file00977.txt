 my name is . of course.. fine thank you. and you?good.it is.     i got a luncheon meeting, so  at the meeting, i got a lunch box.. usually, i'm going to outside for cafeteria  if i don't have much time or  i will buy a lunch box from convenience store. i will take a lunch, you know,   . sometimes.  pretend to be busy.. my working for marketing for foods.  i'm in charge of spreads marketing, so i'm actually working for rama margarine in japan. and also    as a marketing team,  i'm developing their  new products for margarine for japan. i mean, for i am   also  getting the new products from overseas to japan.yes.yes, it is.  i can't say in openly but   the  incident is good for us. because the  consumers' perception against snow is getting lower now. i mean, brand is  getting weaker now. so at the same time, rama is  getting  increase of the sales now..yes. that's the a little  problem. but the   we are announcing in public,   our product is very safe. and also  we are announcing on the   point of purchase, p o p  on the shelf or that kind of thing.    the wind  is blowing for us... i'm originally from fukuoka, kyushu area.. when i was a university student, i came to yokohama. and i stayed in there and,  once i tried to  come back to   my home country.  that's why i joined this company. and actually, i used to work in another company in tokyo area. and i joined to uni leva, saying i'd like go back to home country,   as a sales. then, i move back to home country, working at the sales. but  somehow, i came back here and working now in tokyo.. . the best place was in new zealand. actually, i moved from fukuoka to kagoshima and u. k. for  learning english over there for six months. and moved back to tokyo and sent to new zealand.and came back to yokohama, utsunomiya and, in saitama. the very good atmosphere for family. and also  i like natures. i mean that's why i wanted to come back to my home country fukuoka. because    how could i say, fukuoka is the   very   cosmopolitan area.  central fukuoka is  business city. but  how could i say,  surrounding of the  cities,  we could see  lots of nature remains  still. so  i prefer that kind of situation. and new zealand is exactly     what i want to . so   very nice ocean views and mountainsides  but still,  how could they say,   for business,  they are working  proper business over there. .yeah.right.   maybe  this is   the lady's    bedroom. so   yes,     there is   a bed and computer, typewriter and stereos. and also, she seems like like pets.  there are dog and cat.  and more?.. no,  to be honest, i don't like it..  maybe because of my  backgrounds. because    in a country area  in japan,  many people have a pet in outside of the  house. and also, i did the same thing, i mean, always my parents said,  "don't take pet into the room.".and i didn't do it. so  i still i believe  the pet  should live in outside of the house.i mean, that's the a pet's life.  and also     the hair of the  pets is ,good for health. that is .so  if i think about my kids, kids always want to have a pet but i'm now living in  small apartment house. so if we have a pet, we have to put the pet into house.but i don't want  kids play around the pet  in the room...   maybe because they think    pet is not any more pet. i mean, pet is the  like  their child.  maybe that's why. . but   when i think from the side of pet,  i don't know because  i cannot have a conversation with them. but maybe pets wants to live outside, i mean, nature.  that's my .. honest speaking, yes...    before i start the explaining my room, maybe it's better to explain my family.because there are two kids. and the elder daughter is  ten years old. and younger son is six years old. so they are quite   big now. and  now, they are sharing the room. but both of them started say "i'd like to have a room." and "i'd like a room.". so  i'm living in a three  so-called    three l d k, three bedrooms and living room.  in total, seventy-four square meters. so  not quite big. so  two kids are sharing one room. and  one room is for almost storage. there is the    bookshelves and also clothing  cabinet.and that kind of things. and in the living room,  there is the  computer.  it's that the same thing. and stereo, t v and one other left room is the  for  bedroom..just i noticed the strange .because it's june. . ...o k.  .  yes.hi., hi. i'm sorry     sorry to make you call me.   i have to call you   first.because    first of all, i have to apologize that i couldn't   make to go to the party. no sorry.   that's why i thought the  you called me.  why i couldn't make it.   now, i have to said the reason. but  because my kid got the a fever. so i have to take him to a doctor.. i couldn't go.   wife is  out at this moment. so i have to take care of him. so   unfortunately, this time i couldn't make it. but  next time, i really love to go there. so  could you  please   let me know  you have another party. yes that was my plan.   first of all, i wanted to take my son together with me, he is fine. but unfortunately, i took him to the doctor and now, i have to take care of him   at home.so  unfortunately, sorry for that..  i missed the  surprise. .     sorry but   how about tomorrow?  i will go there and    i will take my son together. so  we will have the all sushi.thank you very much.thank you. .yeah. bye-bye. yes.   not in japan, many times. because of the very small apartment house.  sorry      i don't have to .o k. right. that's o k.  so, yes.  personally, i'd like to have a party but,unfortunately, because of the  house, i mean, my house is located in omiya. so   quite far from here, so when i got the  for instance, visitors from overseas,sometimes i ask them to come over to my house,and get a small party. because  they would like to see  in a real japanese house situation...yes.  yes and no. because the  yes means the    i try to cook japanese foods. and personally, i love to cook. so   for instance, every weekends,i'm cooking. so   i like cook japanese foods for them. but at the same time, i'd like to share the information.   not share the information.   how could i say,  just i'd like to share  all of things. so  that's why i ask them to cook for us as . so   if i invite people to the house,   how could i say,   i'd like them to feel comfortable at home.so  although i ask them to come over, i don't  force them to come to us.  you are not with me.  so always i'm asking "let's share the foods,so i will cook for you. but also you will cook for us.".  that's we mean. i'm doing that.so   we can discuss the    about  each country's foods. and also the  those background of their foods as well..yeah..yes.. o k.  can i have a time to   ?o k.  one day last week,     one driver   sorry, one person is driving a car.  on the other side of the road,  young guy is   no, i mean,  riding a bike,    using the mobile phone.    they bumped each other. but the car driver said,  "that's  motorbike's fault. because  that  rider was phoning. and they are  concentrating to phoning rather than driving.". so    the car driver,  when they called to the police,  the car driver explained to the police.   we don't yet     what's the conclusion  for it. but  the bike was  towed by   how could i say,  car    fix manufacturer.. yes, i have..  the easiest way is  you go to the    driving license school and you can get minimum, i think, two month or something. but in my case, it took two years to get the  license. quite long time.  because the always school teacher was very arrogant. and when i was   when i took the  a silence, i was  very young. and so  when i went there,  i couldn't  endure their arroganceness. and i didn't go to the school. that's why it took two years.. but minimum is two month. of course, you need a little bit of efforts to do .but   it's not so difficult to do it. of course, you have to pass the exam.i mean, reading and also  driving technique. but  if you go there, i mean,   how could i say,          i remember the figures but i think ninety percent of people  got their license if they go to   schools. it's very heavy.  even in omiya.   but that's also   contradictional points. because  for family, i'd like to drive. but at the same time, i know it cause of the  traffic jams.so     if i go to omiya   center of city  i think i should take a train rather than driving a car. but if i'm think about family,  driving. that's my problem... first of all, i mean,   from my point of view, i mean,      rider, i think that rider's fault.   if he is not so concentrate to talking through mobile phone, then,  they could escape this accident i think..   i used to have the motorbike.and i gave up. because     someone always  broke something, i mean, at night.  maybe  high school students or someone i didn't know. but  because very expensive to fix. that's why i gave up. but if my son said,  he is love to ride a bike, i would say o k.  because  i loved it... thank you.   really but i have to go back to  shin-okubo.yes. my base is shin-okubo. today, i got two meetings in shibuya. so no problem to ..
