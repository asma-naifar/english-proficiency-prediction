o k. . .yeah, just a second. for me, but  i need to build up   story, . . o k.  . . .yeah.  that was    kind of  interesting story,   but    it can appeared  on your life or on my life  anytime, anywhere. so, one day last week,   some guy   drove a car on the road.    it was   local way. it's not highway or it's not freeway. and then, the other side,   the  other guy   rode on    i mean,   a scooter, and then  while he drove a scooter,      let's see,  he called to  his girlfriend.  and then, suddenly,   they run into the each other  on the road.  and then,  a guy    who rode on a scooter,      he  his cell phone   from his hand. and then,  of course,   it was a kind of the accident, so   they complained with each other. but,  actually,   no, i mean, i believe  or i think  everybody can believe      driving and calling at the same time  is not good. so,  it was  his fault     who rode on the scooter and who called to girlfriend, so   a driver   who drove a car   explained that situation  to the police.   excuse me,   and the   police believed that. and then,  finally,   a guy  who rode on a scooter,        he lost a scooter. and then, his scooter towed to somewhere.  that was   this picture's scenario, so it's   kind of typical scenario  on the road..?  you mean my work i hope, not i believe, not i guess, i hope i'd like to finish my job until seven o'clock or eight .yeah. .yeah,   if it can be true, that's nice.but ,i'm not sure. sure, and then actually,  in a reality, maybe, i have to work until nine o'clock or ten o'clock.. no problem. so glad to speak english because after  i went to back to japan,  i can't speak .so, now i'm very happy to speak english..you, too. thanks.
