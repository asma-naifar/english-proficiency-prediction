 no.i don't think so.yes, i have. but usually my parents were with me so  i didn't get involved in any problems. no problems and the money. i don't have to pay any. and  i guess you get relieved with your parents because if you are alone and if you go to country like you know, a dangerous country it's a bit get nervous.  . you can't go to places you want to  for your own. and you have to you know, go somewhere else you know, go everywhere with your parents every time you know, and at nights you have to go to bed at a typical time. so that's the bad point. i've been to switzerland before and switzerland is most memorable place to me.  i climbed this big mountain  was very cold but   the view was very beautiful. european countries are very beautiful but i had a very strong impression for switzerland and the meal, the dinners and stuff, were quite nice so i have  strong memory.o k.one day last week. .o k. . one day last week, tom was driving his car through the highway with his orange   benz. and from the other way  there came a boy driving his motorbike with his cell phone. and he was talking to his girlfriend and he wasn't looking around.  and then  they got a crash, and the car hit  the bottom end of the motorbike and the boy on the bike dropped his cell phone and broke it.  fortunately the boy didn't get any injury but the phone got   you know a little bit into parts. then they had this quarrel which one was you know, the careless one. and they quarreled but finally they called the police and the man, did i say tom?tom, driving called the police and claimed him   about it with his showing the cell phone. and i guess  in the end the policeman  punished this boy with the motorbike and he had his bike taken away. that's it..  yes, but  only a small one. i was driving my motorbike and  suddenly from the sideway bicycle with you know, really fast speed  came to me and we almost crashed but  i swift him and we didn't get involved but i slipped and i had my bike cut. i had a lot of cuts in the right-hand side of bike but we didn't call any police. it was aslight accident. yeah. i guess you should call the police. it's the best way.?after that   no i heard that police does everything if you call so maybe you should depend on and rely and then it'll go well, i think.good.. yes i'm going to meet my friend afterwards and going to the sport gym.in new building next to the  campus.yes, .so it's really cheap.yes.with my friend. there isn't any swimming pool, but there's those machinery.yeah, machine exercise.thank you very much.
