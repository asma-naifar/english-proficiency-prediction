.yes. my name is .nice to meet you, .i live in .. when i first moved   forty some years ago, i didn't like it.but now i like it. i like the  's administration.  i think it's one of the top level administration in japan.. many areas like   old people's care and  environmental problems and  they have  very nice policies..no, i live in a house.. with my little bird,ray .  ray  is a parakeet.and it was given to me when my mother passed away. one of my niece said that "  you must be very lonely, so i will give this bird as a birthday present.so   this ray  is a male  bird. and he  speaks japanese very well,  he speaks english, too.. .ray .    the first thing i do after i get up in the morning,  you know, i   clean the cage every morning and then give  the food i'll open the door of the cage he'll, you know, fly  i mean  in the house. so he is just like a family member... and he comes on my shoulder and he  keeps talking and talking and talking. . he said  when the   american university's exchange student came to japan, one of them became sick.and so i asked him quite often " are you o k, o k?". and then ray  copied me, "are you o k, are you o k?" he knows what it  really means. so   he says "are you o k?" in an appropriate time.. .?.  i  retired from work about nine year ago. and so much of my time is  spent for hobbies.  i learn  japanese calligraphy and  i  just started  taking lessons on pressed flower art.and i take lessons on ballroom dance. .  so that keeps me quite busy. .. .maybe i'm doing too much for my age. i'm not athletic.  yeah you know, i  joined the fitness club a number of times, but i gave up every time. and so i needed to do some exercise as i, you know,  get older, i thought that i should do something. and that was the reason why i started taking lessons on the ballroom dancing. i can enjoy not  just repeat the exercise, but i can enjoy and it's difficult how to, you know,  make the right movement, challenging..i see.  this is  a residential area, i think. and it's a very  nice day with the sun shining. and  there is a nice house. and in front of the house, a little girl is  jumping rope, and two boys are playing volleyball, and two cats are talking.  and a man is  jogging. and two ladies are  talking.  one lady has a dog, and one lady   probably just got off the car. and the cat is sleeping  on the car. and  on the opposite side of the  street is a gentleman reading a newspaper in front of his   house... the residential area in this picture is    envious because it has a  large garden while   where my house  is that the houses are crowded so there's  not much space between the .i have a small garden.   someone says  the    as large as a cat's . but my garden is a mouse forehead. .so there's much open space in this picture, but not so      in  my house..yeah.o k.hi, this is . how are you?i'm o k..so  by the way, thank you very much for inviting me for the dinner party.but unfortunately, my friend from america is coming on this day i have to go to the airport to  meet her. and  i'm really sorry that i'll miss this chance, but i'm very much interested in coming to your  dinner party. so when you have another occasion, please just let me know. yeah, but she is arriving very late  in the evening.  we may come back maybe  ten or eleven. it's depend upon the traffic condition.so i can't say but it will be late.. and plane may arrive on time or maybe late.so  i really want to go myself, but as such, i would wait until next time.but thank you very much for the invitation, anyway.for me?.      let me see. when i get back  to the town, i will call you, and if your party is still on, i will certainly come.o k.  extend my apologies   to  those people who are at the party..yes.  not quite often. but maybe   several times a year..? it was yes.  they are not my friends but they are  my neighbors,but        to go back,  i have a friend in spain. she is japanese.but she's living in spain, visited her some years ago and she taught me how to cook paella. so   i  practiced several times, and now i can cook paella. and when i cooked, i invited the neighbors to my house. but usually i have a sukiyaki party for my friend from spain. she comes back to japan maybe once or twice a year. and each time i invite her and our common friends at my house.. it's always sukiyaki .because she wants ..or someday, i would like to invite youto my ....   mister uchida  go to the office every day and uses this station. and one day last week,    he was waiting for the train. but the persons next to him were talking and they were so enthusiastic about their talk that so   one man's arm  hit him. and he dropped his briefcase  off the platform. now he needs to take it before the train comes, but  it was too late. the train was pulling in,  but after the train,  he worried about  his briefcase. it might be broken. but after the train     ran away, he knew that his briefcase was safe.  and he asked the station  clerk to  pick it up for him. and he finally got it to his relief. .? yes.how make it?   know if i can .but we need some  materials.  materials like shrimp,    shellfish. and   spanish people use  i do not know english names, but  . but i don't use this. i don't like it. it's and it doesn't look nice to me.so i skip . but i need squid, i need white-meat fish and i need   green hot pepper, red hot pepper and green  beans.  and then   i prepare these   cut and seasoned and then i    not fry, bake it on the frying pan.and then  put it aside. and then what do i ? and then,   i put some of these   prepared things with ricewithout washing.rice. and then put the  soup  made of consomme and  saffron. english but saffron. and then cook it on the  paella pan.a very .and you'll have to be careful it's not  too  what you call,  i don't know what .and   we needed to make some  but not too much.and then so      i need the soup, i can add it.and after that, i put the shrimps, nicelydecorate.and the    hot pepper which was baked.. and then, since i don't have a big oven, i  cover it    with the aluminum wrapand maybe steam it for five minutes.and it's ready.soin case of paella, it takes longer time to cut meat and fish and .and when this preparation is ready, it takes   about half an hour.so it's nice  cuisine when you invite friends....thank you very much.     i haven't decided ... no., that's o k..
