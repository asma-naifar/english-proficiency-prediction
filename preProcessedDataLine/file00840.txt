good afternoon. my name is  .yes.nice to meet you. actually, not perfect today.as i seem to have a cold, and i seem to have a fever a bit.yeah.... in my case, i prefer to stay home and just keep quiet. and i'm try to have   warm drinks, rather than cold drinks.and, yeah, just take a rest. that is, yeah, what i usually do..yes.  but it's o k, today is friday. as i am partly a housewife,   most of the weekends, i use for housekeeping things such as cleaning or washings, et cetera. and, especially in winter season, i like to go  for snowboarding,sometime. yokohama city. not too much, i think around forty minutes .actually he is in the seventh floor in the same company.. . . yeah. .how? sorry. .. i see.  first,  one of my colleague,  he was working in a marketing department. and it was, i think, five or six years ago. and he was  given a  snowboard as a promotional,  how can i say,  gimmick or  promotion activity.and, as he is not interested in that, he gave me that board to my husband.    so we tried to  start to use that. and, first one or two days, it was just sweating, it can't never  turn rightly. but,   once i find to do right way,  it was complete different world from skiing.  it's amazing, you know.  still  i was a  beginner at that time. so the speed is not like that. , i mean,      slope  is  not too strong, or, how can i say,  i can't explain , but  the speed is not high enough. but, still as i think, probably,   the stance is different from skiing     to the ground or to the bottom, so   i feel more windthan skiing so i was so excited about that...i see. o k. it seems this is  restaurant.  and there are three  tables. and,  in each table, there are couple of people sitting. and also, there is a piano  in a restaurant as well.  and   a woman is,  yeah, playing a piano as well.  time is seven o'clock. i'm not sure it is morning or evening, but probably it  should be  as      the person of restaurant is showing wine to one of the customers.  .?  me?    i like casual ones rather than  formal or dressed upped place like such as this picture.    maybe because i'm wearing normally casual . and  i think i would be more   relaxed if i go to casual restaurant. .... o k. . ..     . i'm looking for   a new gloves.. currently, i'm using gray ones. and    i think  gray color would be easier to fit every other colors. so, do you have any  range of gray colored ?. and   also,  i would prefer to have  wooled one...    how many price ranges do you have? .... and another three types? one.i see. so  what was the differences among three apart from price?.warmness?how about material itself?. how about tone of gray?o k.   right, so a  two  thousand yen one was little bit too light for me. so, maybe i would buy the middle one.is that o k?o k.yeah.thank you.... shopping? supermarkets, discount stores, stores..   most of discount stores have a big  car parking. if we need  something big one, we need car to carry that. we use that stores if we need something big ones.... yes.  yeah, around thirty minutes by car.... .  one day last week,  a girl with his brother were  going to the station and   to meet    their mom.  and,  on a way to the station,      they hear something strange sound from the box.  and the girl found  small cat in a box.        . and,        as   she has empathy to the cat,  she insist   to  bring it with her.  but his brother  say "no.", as just he doesn't like a cat.  and also, he worries that    she must not be able to take care of it  by herself.  however, as   she is just loved to it   instantly when she looked it, she  finally convinced him. and they agree to just ask their mom   to keep the cat.now? no.. i like,  yeah, i like both. yeah.. for me,  i was having a dog  almost fifteen years ago. .it was  when i was in high school student.  and, as we have  one dog with our family, so   some of our family have to take care of him  in turn. such as,  my mother take care of   his foods, and my dad  take care of his    walk. and also,  for my role was also   to bring it   to a walk    in a late afternoon just when i  was back from a school. as it was just  the time i was really  tied up with study for examination to enter the  university,that kind of the break was really helped to  refresh my mind,...thank you... i don't want to,  i'm afraid .yeah.  three people are waiting for me to finish this interview a meeting.. .. thank you. .
