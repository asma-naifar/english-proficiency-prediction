 my name is .yes, please.good. fine. how about you?   i live closed to here like just it takes fifteen minutes from my school, yeah.it's more like campus .yes.since i'm from .my home town? first of all, it's quite different from the tokyo, city areas.  a lot of natures like sea, mountain, so quite different. people also. it's obviously  people in ,   generally they are very  warm hearted.  because probably my guess is that  tokyo is kind of too many peoples living here, so and then you know, . so it's just crowded whatever we do. but  in , there isn't much people .   so then you know,  i mean people are not, you know, get tired of seeing the people. free time,   i like playing sports.   i play many kinds of sports. but these days i play tennis. since the  has the tennis court, it's free for the students..playing tennis? i just started to play seriously    ,    i'm graduated from the other school, not . so i've been here from the   master program. so that this is second year. so just two years. and so my tennis career is like less than two years of course. and  my father  plays tennis, too. and   i mean he was a very good player when he was a high school student. but like  these days he doesn't really play with anyone since he just got really tired, and stay home.   then i started to play with him. so that he is  you know, very excited, glad to play with me. so every time when i come back to my home, he wanted to play with me as like, ", why don't we go?".  my father.yeah.he has great skill of tennis.yeah. even he is older .yeah.o k.describe?o k.  let's see.   o k.     a couple   came to a restaurant  let's say  for the wife's birthday. and then  you know,  this room is quite you know, nice and    being  and bright room. and it's almost going to be  seven o'clock.  and  then  not many,  some customers  came over here, and  eat dinner  as this couples do.   and a guy  come to the couple's table, and  asking to  the husband like " would you drink?". i mean, "would you have this wine?".  his face is like "yeah.  fine,    yes, please.".       and then quite nicely  the  i mean  piano playing  was going on for the making   the environment very well.last time when i went to a restaurant.  ? the restaurant is  o k or not? yes. yeah.  the restaurant was quite nice, and  that was italian restaurant. and   , i mean the meal's price is  reasonably good. and  we ate   just like pasta, pizza.     and    the best one that i thought is that  the desert is quite nice. i mean  there were various kind of cake that  we can choose. so that was good.o k.yes, please.  i'm planning to   travel abroad. but   i don't quite have  clear idea where do i go, or  how many days  will i stay,  so  i just came over here to have some information    about what i'm gonna do. but  my interest is that  i want to go     the somewhere like  there's some beach that  i can swim. really?   which country?       but now it's winter.but japan is winter right now. but  how about  temperature in  indonesia or ?all the year?o k. so  then o k. that seems nice to me.  i want to bring my wife and son with me so that  there will be three of us. but  obviously my son is very small, , i mean just a five years old. so i'm just a little bit worried about bring him to over there, like the weather is quite different  from here to there.  and this is too much worry.  but i'm a little afraid about   something infections.it's too hot so. ?really? is there any hospital orjapanese embassy?? and then for the emergency,  is there any place that i can contact in japanesein bali?  your tour desk. o k.. thank you so much.yeah.  yes, three times.my favorite place? actually i just been to united states and taiwan so i have no much choices. .it's hard to tell since that  both places has, you know, quite good point and bad point, of course. but   i stayed united states a year for study abroad. and for taiwan is just i stayed there like five days for the kind of , i mean,  research trip. so    i have quite more, i mean, memories about united states, of course. but  yeah. i've been there so.yeah.o k.  one day last week,  a boy and a girl   walked by    in a rainy days. and then a boy just noticed that    there's a paper box  beside   the pole.  and then     he has something hearing. and then "what is that?". he asked to the girl.   and then       a girl and a boy   thought that    that sounds like  cats.   and then the girl sat down, and open the paper box,  and  that's obviously  the cat. and then the girl  picked the cat who has a brown hair.    and then  a girl  asked to  the boy, that is like  "can i  bring her back and raise   in our house?". but the boy said,  "no.".  at that point, that looks like  they're a couple. but   still  a girl  wanted to bring that cat to home.  and just keep on asking him  like . and then        the boy is like  telling something like , " my god.  i've got in trouble.".       it seems that  a girl ask him that, "     if you don't forgive me to bring this cat back,   i will quit to be your girl friend.". so then  the boy  i mean,  started to bring  that cat with her with the  girl friend's heart  in a rain.disagreement?disagreement.  could you have a some example of the ? where to go or what to eat.  for my family,  they're not saying like "i will go to.". they're more like to say it to me "depends on you.". so that i will decide by myself so. but with my friends, it depends on friends.so that if a friend,     he's more likely to be the person  who's  you know, self-dependent or like dependent person, i will just let her or let him decide what will we do. .o k.not really. i will go back to  the student room. and then probably yeah, read more books i have to..
