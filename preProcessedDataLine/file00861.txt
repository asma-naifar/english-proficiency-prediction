my name is .yes.nice to meet you. yes, i've been  very  busy because  recently  i was transferred to the sales department.before that, i was working in a laboratory for fourteen years. so i'm  very new to this group. everythings are new to me..   actually,   everythings are very challenging right now.and,   for example, meeting people is very  new to me. and    i didn't meet so many people when i was working in the lab. i go back to my home.i'm staying in a hotel in tokyo.so,   friday evening, i go back to my home.and, monday morning, i come here.hotel? because   our company didn't prepare it actually. and    the policy has not been decided yet. i mean,    myself i  was transferred to tokyo.  you know, if i stay here forever or not, it has been not decided yet.near choshi. yes. my parents, actually.parents?they are  farmers. and,     ?like to do?   not much, actually. not much anymore.  , you know,  when i was a  child, i played with them, but  not anymore.just, you know,     we talk usual things, you know?yes..    yes and no.  the town is very small and still quiet, but   getting busy. a woman is sitting in front of a computer. and, next of the computer, there is an typewriter on the desk.  so  two domestic  animals are there. one is a cat and the other  is dog.    there is a  bed in this room.  and also, i can see a    calendar on the wall in june. .  o k. .   first , i was a student, i  have a room, but the room was smaller than this room. and  i used a   instead of bed. and i didn't have computer nor a typewriter.  i had a  dog but not a cat. and  i kept the dog outside, but not in my room.   it looks this room is better than i used to have.dog?   you mean, a dog i had or? o k. the dog was white and  bigger than myself.because,   actually my family kept the dog, and the dog was older than i.. .  o k.   i think the dog  thought he is a  member of our family. and  i guess the dog thought  he is   older and senior than myself.  so he didn't pay any respect to me. .o k.. yes.    i reserved a  seat, but     i delayed the train. so i want to change this train ticket.so,        can you exchange this to a  money, or  i want to   get another train..o k. .  so,   can i get normal train? i mean,  not reserved train,  but  normal, unreserved train.  why not? .so, if i give you   some reason, why    i was late, you  refund, or, you know, give me another ticket?.  o k. .  o k.   i came here by taxi, and  there was a traffic jam. and   i guess it's not my fault. and   i think you should pay a refund. or,   you know, exchange this ticket to another one.yes. i guess so. i cannot tell exact reason right now, but   there was a heavy traffic jam. it's not normal.. but  i'm rather   in hurry. ?o k. ..no.once or  twice a year. . u s because i don't know much about the other countries. soi stayed there for four months, and  it is the place i only know.i mean, other than japan.special?.  . . o k. i only know about new york area.and   it is said     it is the  melting spot. i see  many people  there.  white, black, asian.     so it's very  different from japan. and i feel, you know, energy from them.. difficult to   organize, you know,   one unit or one organization. so, you know, for example, you know,   president bush needs always to show, you know, u s is very good and very powerful to gather their attention  to make it one,  i think.. o k.. last week, i was driving a car  to go to the office. and   i saw a man was riding on a bicycle,  using  mobile phone.  i thought he was calling to  his girlfriend.  and,  suddenly, he made a   left turn, and       i almost hit him.  and he dropped his mobile phone, and it was broken.  no, actually, there was an  accident.  and he complained about     the damage of his  motorcycle and also mobile phone.  and i called a  police  and also    car repair shop. and,   one hour later, car repair shop man  came and   brought his   motorcycle.strange story. yes.heavy traffic jam? one reason maybe is that  taxi drivers do not know about new york.  i heard  that  taxi driver is not   a   job which is respected. many immigrant come  to new york, and  one of the fast jobs they get is   taxi driver. and, sometimes,  they don't know  which way to go, you know? they don't know about  the map of new york exactly.. seven.early? . .right now?.shinbashi.yes.near station. yes.if  i was not so busy,  yeah, much earlier.no..watch t v,  go out for dinner.  that's it. much things to do right now..  yes and no.i don't want to live here forever.too busy. too noisy.too  polluted. thank you.
