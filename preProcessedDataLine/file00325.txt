my god.   .  that was a studio in . and  it was   at the toilet. the bathroom was a tiny room.   .   what can i say,  behind the toilet, there was a little shelf, and i had a little bottle of a perfume. and, for some reason, by accident, the bottle  dropped inside of the toilet.     and the land owner lives on beneath. and i called her up and asked her, if  she can do something about it, because  the  toilet were not flush. it will take some time to flush. and i was afraid if the water would come up,  and  the floor would be flooded. but  the  landlady told me   to wait until   next morning. so i said o k. and, around midnight,  all of the sudden,  i heard the sound  of the knocking, "". and i went to the door, and there was a lady and her husband   with a bucket.  and  ,  . and i was living on the fourth floor, and  what they told me was that  the ceiling  on the third floor was broken down  the water went down to the third floor.so  that was what happened. and   was terrible.... last week, a gentleman was on his way to his company. and there is other man, a young man who was  on the bike,  talking on the portable telephone  to his girlfriend. and, at some corner,  i think that  the man  who was on his way to his workplace in a automobile was turning to the left. and, at that point,   the rider of the bike hit and there was an accident.  and rider of the bike dropped his   mobile telephone. and there was an arguments between these two  gentlemen. .  the rider of the bike  seems to be   accusing  the rider of the automobile because of the  damage  that his bike received and the damage  of his mobile telephone. . naturally, what happened in a number five because     i don't believe that    you can use the damage telephone to call up the police. but police is there   and trying to hear the story     from the driver  of the car who seemed to have hit the bike. and     a agency or police called up this other agency, and  they  took the damaged   bike to somewhere for  their purpose. and i don't know what happened to the other gentleman.no.i didn't have to have an automobile because i lived in , and they had subways and buses. and you don't want to drive in a traffic jam in .i think the  has the terrible transportation's system, especially around  area. .  . with the traffic light system, you know,     police authority should have sort of the smooth flow of  the traffic, which i don't believe they did. .  the united states,  i think it's just there are rough,  driving and many  automobiles    especially, in  . but drivers are good at driving  in the united states,  compared  i think, to the japanese .because i think   they get  the drivers license  at the very young age. and they are used to driving...anything. any order i take.i would take any order . but i'm interested in a  publication translation. but it's  difficult to get the opportunity to do the  translation of the publications., i have. . when i was working for companies, , i worked for  several foreign affiliate companies, and,   what you say,  i was public relations manager, you know, also did some translation and interpreting work for executives.but  i did that under the  payroll.      and i did sometimes    translating work, part-time. but i'm trying to find a job,  translations work., yes..  you very .. o k.
