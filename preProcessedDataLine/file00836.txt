. my name is . today is very busy for me because  there are a lot of  things to do in my office.   the reason why i mention is that  my senior co-worker    quit  our company  because  he changed job. so  it means   my   amount of job    doubled.  so,   from  nine  a m to eleven p m, i have to . i asked my boss, but  there's  nobody so far.very busy,  yes.yes, of course. and,     one day  of   week day, i have to  come to my office to work.yes.dress policy?   dress policy?  i'm not sure the details, but  my customer is very strict for our uniform. so  i should wear a suit  during  working time.    but  as for   causual wear section,   they usually wear  casual wear. so i envy them.      what is the most important things  for them is our behavior or our appearance. and,    how can i say,   our outlook. outlook is very important for our customer.    for example,   i cut my hair  because       my boss made me cut my hair   and shave my  beard.  because  if     i  have a hair   long,   the customer   probably    think   the boy was not  honest. in our  market, probably so. . sorry, please let me know again..no, so far, . as for me,  the valentine's day is just one day of weekday, because i already  married, and    i have no chance  to be given  some chocolate.  but  i think, as for  young girls,   today is very important day  to confess their love to favorite boy or man.yes.yes.yes,  yeah.  this is  one scene of a classroom.     on the   left side of this picture, the teacher is  making the graph on the black board.  but     on right side of this picture, there are  some student. but    nobody  listen to her  carefully except   this boy  who has  yellow hair. and,   at the center of this picture,   we can see the boy chewing gum and  probably  sleeping.  and, beside him,  we can see the  lady   chatting each other  about what happened  around them. and,  next to  them,  the boy is listen to  some music by headphone on his head  with  drinking    probably soft drink. and,     in front of  classroom,  only this boy is    studying hard...  of course,    teacher should  make them calm and   pay attention to her. but  i think this teacher    has  weak mind for the student.  so, probably,        how can i say,  she cannot    for control to the  student on her mind." " teacher?math?  sorry. math teacher?  .   yes.    my  math teacher,      how can i say,  is not  similar  as   this teacher.  most  difference  is that he is very strict and easy to  have upset with us. so  we should   be quiet and  listen to carefully.  but      most of us  couldn't understand what he was saying,   he taught  mathematic    complexly..yes.yes.yes, o k.yes.. yes. . this is  speaking.yes.   i have to apologize to you, because i couldn't join your party.  the reason why  i couldn't join is  that  i had to   go on business trip  abroad. but    it was very urgent matter, so i couldn't call you  this matter. very sorry.. but  i just lost my mobile phone, and  i couldn't remember your phone number, so very sorry.  but,  how was  party?i see.   now i have to apologize to  everyone  attended  your party.  .yes.yes. yes, of course. but      .  i was on another business trip. and, after that, i had to  go abroad  directly. so there is  no time to  check  at my home, so.yeah, i think so. but,  o k,  next time, i'll held  another partyfor me and for you.that's good? ?yes.   really? so, please bring it, andi'll call to  everyone...at home?    one month ago,  i held a home party for my friends.  and  my wife  cooked  some dishes for us.  and,    from noon to  midnight,  we enjoyed  talking and drinking beer, and so on. so it was very    excited party. and,          when   we invite  some guest to our residence, so my wife  should   clean my room and make our room in order. so, if  there are a lot of   the guest, so       our   rooms are   clean, so i  asked  my friends  to come my residence  often.yes.yes.yes.yes. one day  last week,   the lady  went to the department store  to buy a birthday present  for  her father.      she was carrying a shopping bag in  her right hand.  and,  since  she wanted to buy a  necktie,  so   she went to the tie shop directly.  and, at the  tie shop,  there were a lot of ties  on the shelf. so  it was  not easy for her  to choose it. but  she founded  the tie, and   this  clerk  recommended    it as a  good present for a middle-aged man. and she thought it would suit    her father nicely. so she decided to buy it and  asked the clerk  to wrap it with ribbon. and   she paid for it by cash. and, after that,    on her way to exit,  she found the grand sale of  shoes. and   the price was  very attractive for her, because   they were  thirty percent discount. so she bought a pair of shoes at this place. and  she was going to go out of department store.  but,   after that,   she found  another  grand sales of clothes for women with fifty percent discount. and she wanted to buy  the orange blouse shirt  put on the mannequin. and she bought it, and,  after that,    when  she was out,  she  had a lot of shopping bag.  it was  her impulse shopping. .yes. probably, yes.   now   five p m, but,  after that,     i have to make documents and brochure for our customer. tomorrow,  we will  have  important meeting with  . so i have to prepare for it.  sorry?....  but, after  getting to my residence,   i'll eat my dinner.yes, yes. but it can't be helped.thank you very much.
