my name is .yeah.i live in  in .no. i'm living  by myself.i just moved into    three weeks ago. and     i don't like   the area because  i had to move to .yeah. because i was living  with my friend.  from      friend. and we were living together. but   she decided to get married. so   she said she wants to move out. and  i couldn't pay the rent.so i have to find a new place.so i moved into . and i thought   is much much better than  which i lived before because it's  more convenient. but  i don't like the place because it's too noisy.and    i can not see the  during the daytime. the air is not so good. i study political science.what about political science?     about  international relationship. and i  study about the you know  classic  political book like "plato" or "aristotle". and also i  study about  the political scientists  such as    or  i can not remember. . .. my future plan is   i like to study about the e u and also international relationship and the international     politics. and  i'd like to go to graduate school, too.and after that, maybe i'd like to do some kind of  n g o activity.actually i don't have  much free time this moment. because  once i graduate from junior college, and i had worked   for company for ten years. and then i came back to university again. so  i'm working also after school. i'm doing small business with my friend.so  maybe      if i have free time, i'd like to read the book. but at this moment, i don't havemuch free time. .yes.o k. . it seems to be a  high school class  in suburb of tokyo.  . and a teacher is teaching mathematics. but ,  maybe  most of them are listening to her. and only one boy is listening to her  eagerly. but other person  are just chatting or  drinking something or  maybe   sending the e-mail  to friends or  chewing gum. and then  this class    seems  not to be very good class.  my high school days is quite different from  this class.because   first of all,    we had a  school uniform. so everybody was wearing the same  navy   school uniform. and also  the teacher was very strict. and  our teacher didn't allow us to  do  some kind of  e-mail stuff because first of all, i didn't have mobile phone when  high school. and also  our teacher didn't allow us to chat with my friend. and  we are not allowed to bring any food or drink in a class room at all.and it's quite different. and also  their hair style is very different from us.o k.o k..i'm sorry   i have some question regarding the tour i joined   three days ago. .     would you just tell me why   our hotel rooms were not ready at that time? because  when we arrived at the hotel,  our tour leader told us that our hotel room   were not ready yet. and i have to wait for hours.so  i don't know   what kind of  agent you are using      in hawaii.now but   the problem of the hotel    we can understand, but i've heard that  that hotel person was saying our tour  leader that   they can not find our names on the    you know, reservation list. so i thought there is some kind of mistake    between the  hotel reservation and the local agent, i think.and that  made us to    wait at the hotel for hours. and        we lost our time to go to shopping.so  i think    your  local agent is not so good.and  it's not only this case. .   and also in the    flier,  we could have a   very gorgeous dinner, but  the content of dinner was not so good.and the quality of the food was very bad. and  we paid a lot of money on this tour, but   it's seems like a very very cheap  inexpensive tour.i think   frankly speaking, i want you give me some money back.o k. .in ten minutes.o k.o k. problem?. yes.     i had a trouble   with my  the  rental car. i rent a car in australia.and that the car  was not so in a good condition. so when i was   driving,  the inside of the car, i smell something burn. i think like   something is burning and so like  smoky inside.so i called the  rent a car company, and i asked them to change the car.dangerous. o k.. one day last week,    i went to the station to  go to work. . and i was carrying my briefcase. . and in that brief case, there was important documents. and then  when i was standing on the platform, the person next to me hit me with his elbow. and i dropped my briefcase    on the  railway underneath the platform. and then  we argued. i asked him to just take it back. but   he said that he doesn't know. and it's not his fault, he said. and then train came. and train just  went through  over my briefcase. and  i felt  that my bag is going to be     crashed. and then after  train passed through   briefcase   was there as it was. and   then   i was relieved. and then  i asked the person  who was in the platform which is the train company employee, asked him to   take   my brief case back to me. and the      he jumped to the railway and then he    took my briefcase back to me.           i don't have  a  lot of things to tell about  the attendant because   i have never talked to them  in a station.before  i have no experience that i talk to them or i asked them to do something. so   i can not say anything about them.  i suppose  they are not very kind.  when i was lost? maybe  i didn't ask the   attendants, but i asked just the general people who are standing next to me, . so i didn't ask or just  look  for something by myself.. i have to work. i don't have any  special time. but  as soon as i finish the school, i have to go to office.very late. yes..o k. .
