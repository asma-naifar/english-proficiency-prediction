yeah. i'm fine, thank you. and you?yes. very busy.. because  my senior co-worker   quitted   our company.because he changed   his job. or simply speaking,    the amount of my job are  doubled.so  yesterday,     told ,  on this matter.   from  nine o'clock to eleven p m, i'm recently .. sorry. . ?. .     i can't say.  what     i felt  happy   to enter   is that     i can  contact  foreign customers, so often.and sometimes i can    go on  business trip   foreign country to meet some customers.and   now,    i am a member of a big company.but  at the  business trip scene,    i'm a  representative of the company.so     i can feel my responsibility,of my job.. yes. .    first of all,    do you know,  cultures between  japan and foreign countries are quite different. so i can feel  the differences  to  discuss to meet  customers first.  and after that,        how can i say,  sorry.   your question again... i see. . .  for example,  when i  meet indian customer,         at first   meeting,  we usually shake hand. at that time,        they are  prohibited  to use     left hand. so   we have to  shake on   our right hand.. so.    it was  one of my  most surprising .yes.yes. o k. . this is one scene of  french restaurant.  on the   backside of this picture, there is  a piano. and the pianist is playing the piano. so  the atmosphere of,this restaurant is  nice. and at the center of this picture,  there is a  table,  covered with white  tablecloth. and   we can see  a couple is  sitting at the table. and   besides it,  we can see two tables for two  couples.  and   at the center table,      we can see   two people. and   probably  at this day,      he invites  his girlfriend or  wife  to this restaurant  to celebrate  a certain anniversary.yes.. i'm not   to my regret. i cannot  play .yes..yes. it's up to the customer's character.and character's    favorite matter.  so if   our customer  like chinese, we should  choose chinese restaurant.    and in addition,   we should consider the price. so  if  we invite  important customer, so we  choose   nice restaurant. so it's   case by case.yes.yes.. yes.  yes. . .hello.  this is  speaking..   first of all,     complain to you, on the last voyage i  try.because    i couldn't  enjoy so much.. because  contents of   your package tour  was quite different from  what you mentioned.first,  you said  you prepare for us  first-class seat. but at the airport,     we got a normal economy ticket. so first,  i would like to complain this matter. second one is  that  the hotel level. .   i asked you   to prepare for us  five-star hotels. but  we had to stay at  three   only three-star hotel.and in addition,  i asked you   the hotel with pool.but  at the hotel  i stayed,   there was no pool and no jacuzzi.so there are a lot of differences. . really?. really? but   i joined your  package tour with  my wife.so my wife also  is complaining. and she   she asked me    to have another tour, with her.. so. if possible, i'd like you prepare for us  another  package tour.  free.yes. of course... yes..o k.yes. . sometimes.     i had  troubles.   once  i went to the india.at the airport,   i was checked by a    airport policeman, so on. because  my face was  quite  different from the picture . and  in addition  to it,  i had a   some sample of chemical. because i was a  member of inorganic chemical department.so, they checked my baggage. and     i was  made  to stay   for one hour,at the airport. terrible matter.. yes. . when i was a university student,   my hair was very short.    and  my face  was   little black.but  at that time,  my hair was very long and   skin was white. so quite different...yes. one day last week,  the young guy and his sister are walking in the residential area  with umbrella.  and there was a  colorful carton box   beside the utility pole. when they pass the utility pole,   he heard  something from it. and he were going to listen carefully and  paid  more attention to it. because  cry  from the box was so tiny.   so tiny. and after  that,  she found out the kitten  in the box.  and     she asked him  to bring it to their residence.  but first,  she declined her offer. because  he thought  it was not easy  to have a pet   in the house. and  she    knewed     she couldn't  take care of  it everyday. but  she begged  a lot and   threw away her umbrella.  and   finally,  he  admitted  that  they would  have it in their house.so. . the reason why accepted  was that   he also  felt  it was so miserable. after that,   they    brought it their house.   and then,  the kitten was  so happy. because    she met  friendly person.. yes. sometimes  i met such a things.. . yes. recently,   i'm very busy,so i came back to my residence so late. and  after   getting to my residence, i usually  have a dinner. so  when i was  in residence,   at that time,   my dinner was  not served,on the table.so, i  waited for thirty minutes.but  she   didn't  prepare  for me.so i asked why   she   didn't prepare. but  she     answered nothing.  so  i felt  upset .   the reason, i'm not sure so far.yes.yes. of course.outside?
