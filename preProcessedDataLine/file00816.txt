my name is .yeah, please. please do.yeah.fine.  i'm little nervous.  i haven't taken a   language test for long time, i just have been too lazy to take any test for long time, so i just feel so  nervous..this test? no, no. but i've taken a, you know, other language test like toefl and toeic. but   i've never taken a spoken test. i thought i should really take  a spoken test   partly because   i  didn't do well in a  interview session.     i'm looking for job and then     they  chose me  as one of the candidates, but  i think    i was not chosen because my  spoken skill was so low compared with other candidates so  i thought  this is a great opportunity for me to  practice,  you know, my  spoken english  person who  i don't know well.    university.. but   i am teaching english  right now at a university but        i cannot really work there forever.   there is like  five year of time limitation, so i got to look for job before the time .yeah.no, no. i am working. i'm teaching eighteen classes now  and looking for job. really give up working, i need to look for job.can't afford to .me? .     let's see, what do i do?   i really don't have too much free time at this moment because i'm going to a graduate school. and  i'm teaching eighteen classes. but  let's see. .    when i have time,  i enjoy spending time with cats.   that's a most relaxing thing that   i do at this moment.. just being with them.  because  people are really nice but i really don't know sometimes   how to react with the people, so  i feel very comfortable with cats.. . and   i don't need to behave like as if i were other people. . ..  that's probably the,   yeah, most  precious timethat .  the cats?   anyways   i had a  wonderful cat,   but      the cat was  and he brought so many other cats to feed . so strange cat. anyway  so   some of them decided to stay.  cats, but   they're at my mother's.  i live alone in my apartment,     you know, like when i see my mother, i can see those cats as well...yeah.i suppose this is a classroom situation. and         their age group vary.  some of them are probably  in their thirties and some of them are  in their late teens. so   this is like   high school  where   high school   dropouts can  start studying again to get their high school diplomas, i guess. .and  teachers looks nervous.  she reminds me of .. yeah.  gets nervous and  students are not really interested in  studying english. and  they remind me of my students. .         they don't wanna study anything and then   yeah, i don't know. just  i don't want to be too judgmental but  if this teacher is more interesting or more motivating, they may be interested in studying.  i mean, and then also if she is more student-centered or whatever, because    it seems like, to me,   i mean,   i don't know really what's going on but,    they decided to study again.so  i cannot really blame students too much and teachers are responsible for their motivations as well..    i think, the  first of all, that the material should be  more interesting.      i don't know.   .  it's a good question.  how i would manage this class. .  yeah,  the material should be  something that  they can learn without too much problems. and the materials should be related to the daily  situations.   i'm not saying  every single thing that  she teaches should be       related to the daily life, but   some should be  something that  they can relate themselves to very well. . but  i really like this picture because   lot of times    in a japanese     materials,  the teachers all has to be always men, but   this happen to be a woman..yeah.o k.o k.hello? this is . i'm calling you to   say that    i'm sorry that  i cannot come to the party.  i really appreciate your invitation and   i was gonna be there. but       i have a work to do. and then i thought i can finish it   by like two hours ago.  and  although i worked very hard, i couldn't finish it. so  i cannot make it to the party. i really apologize. . yeah. i really understand,  but    nothing  i can do.  but  if there's another chance,      it would be nice that you could invite me again.    i cannot expect i can finish this work  within a couple of hours or anything, so   i don't want anybody to wait for me.  so   i really appreciate your concern but i really cannot make it. and then would you tell other people that i cannot make it and then    i would like to  see them   at another chance? .see you..no.no.  you mean,  the experience like this?, no.  when i determined to go to a party, i go whether   i work to ... .       i mean,   at the previous work,     my boss was so nice, he was always nice to me   and we talked a lot because both of us are   writing dissertation.  then so    this man finished dissertation  before i did.  i mean,  so then he was invited to me a salvation party. i went there. .yeah... last week,  should i  call this man by a certain name or what?o k. mister suzuki  went to the station to get to work. that was around eight. and   he was waiting  for his train to come  impatiently.     while doing that,  he was kind of    thinking about what he has to do  at work. he has a big project to do. so he was, i guess,   very  careless. and then,      a man next to him pushed him. and    he dropped his bag.   and   the man and  mister suzuki was wondering  what they should do. .  it doesn't seem like it's really good idea for them to reach the bag. and   while they were talking,  the train that the mister suzuki  was going to get on came. and, of course, he was so nervous, and    he almost had a heart attack.   let's see.     but,   fortunately, the  bag looked o k. and  it was not damaged at all.    none of his belongings was  got out of the bag or anything. and    the man    working for train station came to pick up his bag. and  then        that  man gave mister suzuki the bag he dropped.   no, i take subwayto ueno and then i take  j r to  the closest station. it's always packed.  but  i really appreciate that i can    ride trains because  driving,  in the states, i had two serious accidents, you know,  nothing really happen to   my body or anything, but i'm not a good driver. and i really appreciate that i can  take advantage of      that transportation system. although it's packed, then i just feel it's o k. as long as i don't need to drive, i'm happy..  i'm going to work again.  then recently,    i just talked to  mister .i'm making a   presentation of a computer-based toefl., yes. . .yeah. .
