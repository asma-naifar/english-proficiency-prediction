i used to play tennis when i was in middle school.and i like it very much. but i like  badminton like i said last time.but i still like tennis, too. we have to use the wrist morein badminton.the shuttle doesn't fly a little higher like if you don't use the  wrist.and then tennis, if you use the wrist, you injure your arm so badlyso you can't use it. and that's the most different thing, i think.team sports?. ?yeah, i used to do it.and i still doing  badminton, too.mentally.  mentally. in doubles, you have to like think about the other person more. and you have to move according to  the other person's movement. so you have to think more. but you can enjoy the sports more if you have another playing with you, i think.yeah. not today, .no.  monday and thursdays, we don't have practices.yeah, they've already quit it.and i think they're really having a hard time right now.yeah. . third graders doesn't come to the club activities like they quit at july or .so the leader was already the leader right now.in the summer, yes.yeah..
