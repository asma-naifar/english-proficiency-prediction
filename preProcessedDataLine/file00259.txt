yeah.   i have a hobby   to have a  trekking and hiking or say,  mountain walking. so, i like  any   outdoor sports. so, in the summer season,  i often   go up to the mountain site to enjoy camping,  to have a one-day hiking with mountain cooking. yeah.yeah.  that's the idea in the weekend.  and   in the wintertime,  i sometimes  go up to the mountain site  to  enjoy skiing. yeah. but  since this spring,  i got hay fever. i have no idea how i can do outside.    yeah, actually, internet.  that's the idea.    since the beginning of the   last month,         almost every night,  i log on myself to the internet auction site. yeah. because i'm planning to move my house  in june this year. so, i try to  reduce the number of my belongings.   therefore, through the internet auction,  i try to dispose  my stuff   to the buyers. yeah. actually, it's really exciting to see      my house  is coming very neat  as well,  i can get small money.yeah.good idea. yeah.what?all right.    question. question. what should i do? describe.      this is scene of the classroom.   maybe junior high school.  because the  student   their age  group  something like  twelve to fifteen.   the   female teacher,  she is teaching  mathematics. but  the     no, only one student  in the front line  is concentrating   on the lecture. but  the rest of the student,  they are not.    the female student of the front row, she's  communicating with  maybe, internet or playing with  cell phone. and    a guy,    he's seated at the   isle side  on a front row.      he looks sleepy and having a chewing gum.  and  second row  and third row, there's  no student  who are paying the attention . my days?      but     not so much different, i suppose.  actually,    i had the same behavior in the classroom. yeah. but        i can assume,   we knew how to control  the extent of the behavior.  therefore,   recently,  i could see out of the   newspaper report and the articles  the people  they play  so much violence. yeah.        in my school days,  i have not see such a radical violence..all right. examinee?    examinee. that's me. o k. all right. o k.  .   my name is .  good afternoon. can i speak to   the person  who was in charge of   the singapore three-days tour  which you conducted end of last month?can i speak to the person?thank you.?   my name is ,     of , .   . .. . thank you very much. you remembering me.    actually i call up to you  to talk about my trip.     i came back last night. but   i was really upset.   because,  there are so much discrepancy between what you  explained  before my departure and what i experienced  during my tour. .yeah.    there were two issues. number one the hotels.  hotel accommodation.  in your brochure and in your explanation,  you told me     my accommodation  would be with  raffles hotel.  yeah. actually,   that is  one of the best hotel  located in singapore.  because of this accommodation,   i booked   the tour with you and i paid  such a extra premium  compared with   the other tour  which other tour   agent conducts.  but  when i reached to singapore,  there's nobody  who received me at the airport. and  when i got contact with your     local  tour agent,      somebody of the local agent told me   i must go  to oriental hotel instead of the raffles hotel.     yeah, but  there was no choice but i have to be there. so,  i took taxi  by myself,     and i went to oriental hotel. and i expected  somebody of the local agent to be there and,   he  could make  some kind of the explanation about the sudden change of the hotel accommodation. but  no one there. and    when i inquired with  the oriental hotel receptionist,    the reservation was there since two weeks ago before my departure.   anyway,  there was no choice. i stayed there. oriental hotel is one of the   first-class hotel. so,  i accepted that.   next day,   in the itinerary, which  your brochure describes,    was  the limousine car tour     should be set for my first day  activities. but  when i  came out  the hotel entrance nine a m,  there was no limousine car. there was only one local taxi  waiting without any  tour conductor. so, i have some difficulty to speak  local language.  therefore,   i had a very hard time     to take a tour with the local taxi drivers. so,  it was been really   disappointing me. therefore,   i need you    to describe why, and what kind of the compensation you can afford to me.  as soon as possible, but    i'm really   upset  so tell me,  how long  does take for you to investigate the issue,five minutes? that's fine. .thank you very much. i will be waiting.   i can give you my  contact number now, because i'm outside of the house. so, this is my cell phone number. .i'm looking forward to   . too long? no, actually.        i have never had this kind of disappointment.  because  always  i chose  the first class travel agent.yeah. maybe that's  tips to avoid .yep.all right. so,  how many minutes can i spend  to make a whole story? just few minutes. o k.     there's one guy  who is driving  the orange color passenger car   to west to east.     there's another guy who is driving  the green  motorcycle while taking a call  by cell phone with, say, his girlfriend.      it seems there's    minor accident  between  orange color passenger car and green color motorcycle. and   the door mirror  hit   the  right hand of the motorcyclist. and unfortunately, the motorcyclist  dropped the cell phone.  and   the cell phone got serious damage  as well,  the motorcycle the  rear lamp   was broken.   and    the both parties  they stop to turn the motorcycle. and they   began to dispute. and  the motorcyclist made a strong complain about the damage of rear headlamp as well as the cell phone.      either party might report to the police. and  police came up there.    and when  police made interview with the both parties,  the passenger car driver,   he  pointed out   the motorcyclist,    he was making a call while   driving. so,  it seems    the police man,  he accept his explanation and    he agree  to release the passenger car drivers. because,  passenger  drivers   looks innocent and   there is fault   with the motorcyclist. eventually, the motorcyclist  called  the workshop   to load his motorcycle  to the workshop.you're welcome.   actually since i have the  serious hay fever, i'll take a rest. very much. have a nice weekend. bye-bye.
