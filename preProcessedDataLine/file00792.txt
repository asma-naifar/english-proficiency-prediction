 not system, but   is very crowded, and  is not so crowded.   not system again, but so expensive, you know. . but  the most advantage in  system is very punctual. and    they should be very proud of it. but  is  two or three minutes delay  is a matter of time, i mean it's of course, you know. so they should have more punctual system or systematic...yeah.you have to choose . .  i should start now?    a man is driving a car. and   another man is riding on the bike    while he is talking to the  his girl friend on the phone. but unfortunately,  what is that?   as   the man     a riding on a bike   why is that? so  he is absorbed in  talking too much so that    he had ignorance of   shit, i hate that,   coming.    so he had a  car accident. what a messy story, i don't know.      so the two man had quarrel   which one is   to be blame.    and so  they  call for a policeman's help to solve   the problem. and  the man who   drove the car,  his argument was   the bike man had  talked     with his girl friend using mobile phone so this is his fault.    and a policeman   i'm sorry, seem to accept    the man's statement who  drove the car. and  finally, it seem that   a    trouble was  solved. and  the bike was   carried away  by truck.  .i don't like .. but     i'm not sure about  number there's pictures..  i don't like mobile phone. there is  reasons.   for example, the  when you use mobile phone on train, that makes passenger very noisy.  and i happened to listen to his talking, and the talking is nonsense, you know, just like b u l l  s h i t, you know.     but some people are    needed to use mobile phone such as the salaried man or   older people like  you know, in my case,  for example, some children has sick, and  his mother need to contact with his father. but most of them are just like fashion. everyone has it so i have to do it. ..all right. thank you very much.that's a coming down, right?
