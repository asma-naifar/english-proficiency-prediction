good afternoon..my name is .yes, please.i'm o k. how about ?actually, i had a business trip yesterday went to tokushima. so i had to fly  in the morning.so i feel a little bit tired because of the flight.actually,   we have a office   down in tokushima that once a month or twice a month, i have to go  to tokushima to meet our staff members, branch, actually.so yesterday,  our  meeting schedule was pretty tight.  from eleven in the morning to probably twelve in the midnight, really,really, in a way, i mean serious but  very fruitful  i mean  discussion .yes.. i work for textbook research and development which we create the materials for our students. i mean english textbooks or workbooks and c ds. those like   english language materials for our students in . and also  i mean, of course we research   the english language, and also create  the books that we can sell at the book stores.so we develop actually   the english language-related books.. tons of difficulties at the moment..for example, we have to suit our students' needs. and students, their levels also really . so we have to examine their need and   language knowledge. and, how do i say, we have to research really carefully about what students expect us      to make the really good quality textbooks. and then also, we have to examine our students'  weakness. i mean, especially the japanese language learners' weaknesses and maybe strength as well. so first,  we have to be really careful what sort of  needs out there in the market. market, which means that our students. and then also, we have to make another books which appeal to  the various type of readers  i mean, in japan. it seems to be really close, but actually it's  i mean,  for us, really difficult to examine  for the various  readers. readers means that they're not just students. and  you know, sometimes  their needs or their objectives  to kind of buy a book, especially related to  i mean english language is a bit different from the students. so we really have to kind of examine   the purpose of the books and then the what kind of books that we have to create, which is ..free time.  usually i clean my apartment, then kind of do the  the laundries and those kind of  daily routines.because since my   working schedule is quite tight, i mean from kind of noon to midnight. soon weekends and free time, i do mainly kind of clean my apartment  which makes me really feel comfortable, though. yeah. and then also cook. i love cooking.and also   go shopping... o k.   i mean,   i mean, this is the restaurant, and a couple is just about  having dinner at the really fancy restaurant. and the man in yellow suit is also just about drinking a wine. he actually is   tasting wine, sorry. and the woman in   no, no, no, pink  dress is just  i mean, seeing him tasting wine. and maybe waiter, i should say, or i don't know,  i forgot the word, but someone who actually kind of recommend really good wine to the guest,  he is kind of showing a bottle of  wine to the man who is just about tasting wine. this  looks really good, fancy restaurant.and the woman in  green dress, showing her back  to me, actually, is playing the piano..eat out. yes. . o k. ?o k. the restaurant  that i really like is just a little bit  like more casual than this kind of fancy restaurant. and i love italian foods, and i love japanese food.  and the main big differences is just i really don't drink wine.so normally, i just order kind of mainly food, and  i really like to spend a little bit more casual  type of atmosphere restaurant. so my favorite restaurant is really, really friendly and kind of less formal than this  restaurant..thank you.sure.. o k. actually, i bought this thing  couple of hours ago.then i went home, and opened it. but unfortunately, this is not the one that i really like. if it is possible, i'd like to return it. and then if it's still possible for you to just refund me the money, that would be really nice. really?but actually,   i haven't used it yet. and  you know, i really saw  the other one over there. i really like that, so if it's possible, is it o k for you to just change the thing?.. actually    the problem is the color.  i mean,    after   i kind of thought over kind of quite long time, then i found that i really like that color, not that this color. right. yeah. but you know, i mean, sometimes i saw it, then change my mind. or just i  realize that  my  i mean, favorite color is that, not . anyway, you know,  as i told you before, but i haven't used it yet..... yeah,  i do appreciate that if you could talk to your manager or the one who  actually supervise this section.. sure. no problem. thank you ... sure. . yeah. actually, even though i really realize that  the one i really don't like or    i mean,  the things that i  don't  really like much, but actually i really don't bother anybody. ,  i  normally gave it up. i mean, gave it up means that i normally don't go back to the store then ask for refund or to change. i just give up my ideas that         the different one might be  nicer or that   way of thinking. so i just gave it up.  then   especially after i buy it, and then  bring it back   my home or my    house, then even though  i realize that  this is  not  i really want,but that's o k. maybe  i'll live with it,  i'll just use it.  i'll probably use it, but just i don't ask for the  refund or, you know, to ask for change. i mean, i really just don't want to confrontate anybody,   just forget it. ...o k...    one day last week. o k. a guy went to the station as usual around eight o'clock last week.  then he was waiting at  the platform. while he was waiting at the platform, he  happened to drop his briefcase. then   no,           i mean     he was really upset. then but he didn't know what to do. then he was thinking what he should do next. but while he was thinking,    i mean       the train just came in and ran over   the briefcase. but actually  after the train went through, he just found that  the   briefcase was o k without any damages or anything. then station master came, then       picked up    the briefcase. and gave it to him. and  finally he got his own briefcase   without any damages.. good question. actually, i have to work tomorrow, so my actually day off is only sunday. so again, i'll probably do my laundry and  i mean,  i'll clean my   no,  rooms and then the probably i just go for a walk if it's really nice weather.tomorrow morning, i have to  wake up as usual. so maybe around eight-thirty or something because my work starts at   eleven o'clock.one day weekend. yes, very short. thank you .thank you.
