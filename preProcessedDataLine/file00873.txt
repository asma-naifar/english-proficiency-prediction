good afternoon.yes. i am .i'm very fine, thank you. and you?typical day? . how i spend ?. on weekdays? . i've just  moved to a new department from february. and  i normally come to the office around ten o'clock and stay until midnight.. so,  mainly, i spend most of my time in meetings.   so i have relatively    five to six meetings per day.yes. after that, i do my  normal work . i want to ask that as well to my boss. but  we have a very   strong relationship with our  advertising agency. and we tend to share a lot of information together, and not only by mail, but also meeting each other. we think that we can strengthen our relationship.. in my free time,  if i'm in the country,   i like shopping,  spending time with my friends, watching movies. and, if i can have  enough time to go abroad, i like traveling especially to southern islands.yes, like asian countries.. i went to cebu in the philippines. . i pretty enjoyed. i used to live in england when i was very small. and i  traveled a lot of places in europe. but, these day, i tend to visit asian countries and also  to the states as well.. i have many friends   in other countries, and i visit  them.. i have friends in the philippians, and also in thailand, singapore.. in , there are many international training courses. and  i met those  friends  in that courses.yes, it's very interesting. . this, i would like to go there.  this is a ski resort, and  many  people enjoying  skiing and also  making snowballs, throwing snowballs. . .  and some couples are skiing very good. and also, there is a lodge near  the place. and some couples are having coffee together.  it's very fine day.  anything else? sports.  other than resorts..   i like beach rather than  these   winter resorts. so  that kind of sport is one of my favorite places.  and,   since i spent most of my time working  in this  center of the city,  i would rather like to go out to a relaxing place with  a lot of green,  quiet place.  i just only had chance to watch the news   after getting back to home. so  i watch the  short track,  the skating race and also  the "ski dance". . . ski. . sorry, sorry. .  skating dance..   i realize that  there was  sad situation for the russian couples    who first of all won the gold prize. and,  basically,      it should be run by justice. . so  i thought  it's a very sad thing to happen.  but   i think it was the canadian or  from the states,   did also well. and also, the russian couple,   their  demonstration was  also very nice.yes.yes..yes.  excuse me.. i bought this clothes  the other day. but  it didn't really fit to my size. so, would it be possible for me to exchange it to the other size? .? .    i did.  but  it really didn't match me after getting back home when i  tried it again. so   it's only yesterday that i bought. so i was thinking whether  it's possible  to change it to the other type.yes, i have this ..  i see. .  too bad.   any other chances for me to ? then, i'll pay the gap.. because i don't like this  type. and  even though i keep it, i will not wear it. so i'd rather pay the gap..by the way, how much is the gap? o k. trouble?. yes. when i visited spain, i bought this leather jacket. and  it was very nice, and it was  a shop close to my hotel. and, after coming back to the hotel, i noticed that this   security tag still on. and   i don't know why  the bell didn't ring when i left the shop. so i went back    to exchange it. but then, i was asked to show them my passport. in spain, they require  to show the passport in any occasions. and i didn't carry my passport. so i had to go back to the hotel again. and then, came back in the third time,  i manage to change it and also let them take off the tag. they didn't apologize  at all. so i was very disappointed.  . then, explain?. yeah. one day last week,  there was a man who's driving on the street. and then,   from the other side, there was a guy  riding a bike  and also talking  on his mobile phone. probably, it was his girlfriend. and then,       when  the driver  tried to turn to the left,   this guy who was riding the bike, he dropped his mobile phone. and that mobile phone hit to the car.  and  the bike also  bumped into the car. and then,  this guy who was riding the bike tried to complain to the driver. and  he was showing his damage to bike. and then,      the driver, i think,  called the police     to  help them out. and then, the driver tried to explain that since the mobile  phone hit the car,  the driver tried to   avoid hitting. but, in fact,  in the end,  they hit.  and, in the last,        ,  it was carried to   be amended? in the train?if it's very short, i don't mind. but, if it starts  to become very long, i'll start being bothered  because,  normally,    in the train in japan, is very quiet. and  people tend  to talk in a quiet voice. and also not only the mobile phone, but people who are  listening  their m d  and also the c d player on the train, and even they use the earphone, the sound will come out. and that is sometimes bothering.after this interview, i have a meeting .. fortunately, i have  one left. i left the office yesterday in midnight. so, today, i plan to leave much much earlier. , indeed.
