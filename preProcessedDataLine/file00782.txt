driving using cellular phone is illegal and then so  i scold him  and then i called to the police and then police  came to us and then police investigate about the situation  and then    they understand so the guy who has the cellular phone  is wrong and then  the    he had to  pay fine or        he lost   his bike. yeah. .. . like  this kind?.  o k depend on the accident but anyway  if the accident was not  serious   i don't want to call to the police office because if i call to the police officer the accident get bigger and in some cases   i have to pay fine or yeah so yeah in case
