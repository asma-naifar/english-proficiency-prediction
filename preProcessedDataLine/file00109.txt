yes.hello..yes,  my name is .yes. living here?yeah.  here means the  in this area or?.  i'm now living in  area., yes..town?   it's a   newly developed town, and  it was  developed by the  tokyo metropolitan. and  i lived  in   there  around the  three years ago when i came back from the united states.and    it's a     very much suburb area.not so convenient.   it's  a little bit  far away from the station. so we are now using a car  by commute.          the reason is  yeah, the   environment was good.  the  air is  freshened.  we wanted to live in a very   good  circumstance area.  and  my wife  likes garden very much. so  it's a  not the apartment, but house. so  my wife is   very glad to live in that area.but for me,not so convenient.     yes,  usually  i go to the shopping with my wife,  and  i go to the gymnasium to take a exercise.  yeah,  and    now my  last daughter  is  expecting to take a exercise  next year. so i'm  teaching her. yes. yes, i like travelling very much. so  actually   in my  current position, i have to go around various places  such as u s and germany and  various  asian countries. so   yeah,     as a business trip, i go around various places. but  actually i want to go  personally.   take a rest for a while .. yeah. in the past, yeah.  when i was in america, i went around   various national park  such as   grand canyon or      and  yellowstone. yeah.      during the two weeks,  we went around the various national park, and  total mileage of the   trip  was more than four thousand miles within two weeks. it was a very tough,  cheap, but   we went by  the big car,   and  we  went various  places, and  we stayed a very cheap motel. yeah.. . yeah.  it's a    good place to live. and  yeah,    many children  are playing in the  garden.   yeah, but it's a not japanese  circumstance.  i think it's  u s or  european styled   living place. and   yeah,        what i say . so  when i was in america, i lived in  this kind of  houses. and  in that area, there was no fence between the house. so  yeah, it was a very  good  circumstance     yeah, in america  when i  lived..yes.       the place  where i was born was in .. but        i was  living in   city. and then   when i  join this company, i moved  from  to .and   after i married, i moved to   area.. not so different. but  yeah,       is much  hotter than  .   is a kind of  low places   surround the mountains. so  it's a very hot place in summer, and it's very cold in winter.yeah. .yeah..yeah.o k..   yeah, i will consider the reason i cannot attend. o k., yes.hello. hello   miss, i'm sorry,  miss mimura. .i'm sorry i couldn't  attend   the party yesterday.  that was because  i had a suddenly  had a  very serious    situation     about my job. so  i couldn't   attend the party. but       yeah, actually  my boss in the  malaysia  asked me to explain about the current   serious   company situation. and also    we will have a restructuring   situation in the near future. so  i discussed about it.  and    it took a long time. so i couldn't attend the meeting. that is a  yeah,    i apology  to you very much. but  next time, when i have a  chance to go to your house,         i want go to your   house. and  i want to see  your  family  members.yes.yeah..  . but  yeah,      yeah,  that is true, and   i really     apologize to you  about it.yeah. no, no, no, no, no.    i didn't forget  the party, but  yeah, i worked  till  late at night. so      i thought that it's not the  appropriate time to call to you. . yeah. but  it was  late.    after  eleven o'clock, i  finished my work. so  yeah, i couldn't call you at that time.o k.  yes... yeah..yes.  i had     many chance  because my kids were     my kids  went to the school, and  the school was a very familiar school. and   we were invited  by the various  people..     yeah.    we went to the      thanks giving party, and  yeah, actually the   most interesting one was  i forgot the name,  it's   pumpkins.     it  the end of  august. it was    halloween party. yeah.   that was very fun. and  yeah  at the   halloween time,  many kids go around the various houses. and at that time, we have to  distribute the candies to each children. yeah. that was a very good experience for us...yeah..o k.o k.yeah i explained about the total  stories?o k.. .  yeah. one day last week, i drove a  car. and  someone  came  from the  opposite side   by riding a bicycle,   not bicycle, it's a  motorbike. and  unfortunately,  i crashed to the   motorcycle  at the corner. and   the   yeah, motorcycle was broken, and   the   rider claimed to me   about the  accident. that   he insisted that  i am  wrong.       but   yeah, it was a  corner's accident. so i thought that the           mistake ratio is   fifty and fifty.  i don't know the exact  word, but  yeah. so  i called the policeman, and   i explained about the situation to the policeman. and  finally,   anyway  the motorbike is broken. so   it was  carried by the  truck to repair... .   yeah.    i've never experience this kind of  examination. so  yeah, i couldn't  imagine   how i will explain it.yeah.  i've never experienced this kind of accident..yes, i drive a car everyday., by commute     i drive a car. yeah. i had a  ticket  of  speed over. but   i didn't have any accident in the past..right procedure?. i think   yeah,  at first,  we will invite a  policeman, and explain about the situation. and  when we want to   cover the damage by the insurance, we need a  some kind of  certificate  from the policeman. and  to submit to the insurance company. i think that is  . yeah.  i'm sure the exact one. but  i think    if i will have an accident, i will do like this.yeah.if  someone will be  hurted by the accident, then  the first  priority is      call to the       to hospital or  not hospital,  it's a   ambulance  office. and  yeah,       to  save the life is  most priority..o k. .yeah. .i think so.. .yes, my house is a very rural area. so  yeah,    the car is a very important one,   necessary to  move around.. it's a very  important  method  to  move from my house   to  everywhere.my wife's driving skill is the   fairly well... .thank you very much.
