.sure. my name is .nice to meet you.. i'm fine.  i mean,  recently, i couldn't take enough sleep. so i'm a little bit sleepy all day long. but it's o k.because  lot of work. i'm working on  marketing section.and i'm in charge of .but now, the    shampoo and conditioner has been launched. and we are suffering from   the launch. because they increase a share, from . so we are suffering. so there are many things to do and also we have many activities,to hold number one position in the market.. .. for example, weekends,  i just want to sleep until twelve at noon. and just relax, a coffee. just read some magazines or just have lunch with my friends.so that's the way i relax myself...., i'm thinking of starting to work out. but of course, i cannot go to gym   during weekdays. so i have to go there on  weekends. but  other things to relax myself, like for example, i just put   additives to the bath, while i'm bathing.or  just walk  in the neighborhood.. . . but i have to start to work out, anyway..my neighborhood? i live in   in  line. i just moved   from  to . and it's very comfortable   staying there. because there are many shops. i mean, not like a fashionable shops. not boutiques but more like a convenient  shops like  lunch box shops more reasonable shops.and also it's very close to shibuya.so i don't need to take time from  to go everywhere. but when i live in   , it takes more than one hour, everywhere. so it's much comfortable. .. because  actually, i came back from the u. s. last october. and that time,  i didn't have a house. because  i used to live with my parents in . but they moved to .and that house belongs to my aunt.and she is thinking of selling it to someone or she is   renting it.someone. so i didn't have a house for myself. so that's why    i started to look for a house. and of course i wanted to move  in the city...not really. maybe i mean, yes on weekends. but not during weekdays... this is a picture of a classroom. and  the teacher is standing  in front of    the blackboard. and  maybe she is a teacher of mathematics.   but only a few student, actually, one student    concentrated on that class. but  other students are  ignoring her class. for example, one guy with a regent, the   funny hairstyle, he is just  having   the gum. and maybe sleeping, not sleeping.  and also other girls, they are just chatting each other.   and  other people are    just ignore the class like checking the e-mails on the cell phone or just     drinking some tea or something.o k. . i think it's because she  just talking to the board. she is not looking at   students.and  . maybe   i can  understand their feeling. because  i didn't like mathematics.   i can understand their feelings. maybe her lesson is just boring. or  they just don't want to  study mathematics, except for the guy in front of her.yes. .i was, a good student, i think.first,   they don't wear  the school uniform. to me, they look very free. they behave very freely.  my high school was very strict. so it's not prohibited to bring the cell phone or like a c d walkman or,that kind of stuff. if i brought that kind of things, definitely the teacher would  just take it from me  that i can focus on  lesson. so the atmosphere is completely different. and also  my  high school is so strict that   of course, i have to wear the uniform. the hairstyle.  i cannot change  the hairstyle so often.because if my hair length is longer than my shoulder, i have to, , tie up. so i couldn't enjoy changing the hairstyle. or of course, i couldn't change my color .so everything is  allowed in this class.so i think because i had a hard time in  high school,that's why  i can enjoy,the current life..role-play... some  tough situation. o k. right..    i bought an iron  at this shop.but      what is a excuse for it? i use it at night. but it wasn't warmed up enough. so i want to return it. and exchange it. or      i want to exchange to other one.but   i have a receipt that  confirms that i bought this iron at this store. and it is true that it didn't work.   i know you that you have  like a  company policy, but i cannot accept it. i'm sorry. ..  . but in  instruction book, it says "it warmed up enough,to work for   the clothes.". but it didn't.  i don't think i can trust this product. so anyway, i cannot  continue to use this product anyway.. so you mean that  you can contact to the factory?.  but  i always use this store. like to shop  at this store. . . . o k.. that's very kind of you. very. thank you. .. it's hard negotiation... i have to say always, because  especially in the states,   i try to think of the example.    yeah,     for example, when i was on the train,and  i didn't get the ticket. because at  my nearest station, there is  no one working there. but  the conductor thought that i didn't get the ticket. because i didn't have money. or because i just wanted to cheat it.and i explained that i got on the train from that station which nobody's  working there. and  the person   understood my situation or something like that...  in japanese, yes. but of course in english, it's more difficult to  negotiate. because i have to translate,from japanese to english. and i have to speak at the same time. so, harder........ one day last .. . excuse me. that person is me? or .. o k.. one day of the last week, my boyfriend drove a car.  and    from the opposite direction,  the guy talking on the cell phone was  driving a  motorcycle.  that person seem to talk to her girlfriend with a cell phone  while he was driving.  but when my boyfriend tried to curve on the  road, the guy with the cell phone,   attacked to the car. and at that time, the cell phone was    broken. and the guy  with the cell phone complained about that cell phone was destroyed because of my boyfriend. so decided to call the police. and my boyfriend        explain about the situation. i don't know what it means.  ? sorry.  i couldn't get the point of this cartoon... . and   o k, while  the guy  with the cell phone parking the motorcycle on the street,    the cleaner   came by. and he didn't notice that motorcycle was belong to the guy. instead,  he just  took it from him as a garbage. and  left.so the guy with a cell phone lost the  cell phone and also the motorcycle at the same time. so it was  unlucky day for him. what   the people, think about.yes. that's a first time i drove a car. i already had a car license. i got the car license in japan. but i didn't drive. because my family didn't have a car.and also my boyfriend hate my driving. that's why i didn't drive in japan. but in the states, i live in connecticut.so it is natural that i have to drive a car. because there is nothing. train comes only once an hour.. compared to tokyo. . i should say it's much better than japan. because there are no motorcycle.maybe some motorcycles on  highway. but not so many like in japan. or of course, there are not so many pedestrian on the street,in the states. if there many  pedestrian, it might be  very dangerous in the states.  so in that sense, there is no obstacle on the street. so it's much comfortable, and i never drove in japan. so  to me, it's easier to get used to driving on the left side.the opposite side from japan. .right side in the states.and left side,....  after this, maybe i'm gonna finish the document for the research brief or very administrative job. . . unfortunately. and there is, end. but i think that the people working in this company,are in the same situation,  especially marketing,section. but i like busy days.  i miss. o k. thank you very much.
