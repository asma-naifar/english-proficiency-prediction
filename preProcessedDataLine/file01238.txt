  i don't know.     i went to a halloween party and  it was my first time going in the states  to a  halloween party. and  it was fun because we were all wearing costumes and  we ate a lot of food. and the girl that i went  her house,  i think it was a dining room, they made that room into like a dance room.so it was all dark and they had a light.  and  they had like all different types of music playing. and yeah, it was fun. . can this person be me?o k. one day last week, i was walking to the station because i had to go to work. it was eight o'clock and since it was so early in the morning, there were so many people and it was very crowded. . and wait, i was waiting for the train to come and so i was behind a man who was lining up before me.  he was talking to another person and he didn't know that i was behind him. so he lifted his arm quite hard and fast that the luggage that i was holding, it fell off to the  wait,   trail,  man, i forgot what this is called. it fell.  i got so angry and start yelling at the man. but the man just said, "i don't know.". and raised his hands.  ten seconds later, the train came and it ran over my or i thought it ran over my luggage. but thank god, it didn't. and it was just lying there like it was before the train got there.  i called the train man and told him what happened. and when i told him, he picked it up for me and  gave me the luggage. everybody was happy and so was i.  i will go up  to the man that works at the train station.and ask him what i should do because i lost something.yeah. yes, ma'am. i once saw two guys fighting on the train. and like a month ago, i lost my pass   schoolon the train. and i thought someone stole it, buti found out that   like it fell on the train.and so when i when i went to the train station to see if i lost it, they had it. so  i got it back. i was very thankful. yes.  i lived in  so we didn't have trains.so  most of the time, car was our transportation. and to get to school,    i took the bus. but other friends, like since they're already able to drive, yeah, they drove to school. since i don't like the trains, i prefer the one in states. like i like cars so i prefer cars. but trains are really, they are very  useful.because   i didn't have a driver's license so when i lived in the states, if my family was sick, then i couldn't go anywhere. but here, although like your parents are sick, you can just take the train and meet your friends.so yeah,   i guess if i have to choose, then a car. but  i like the both. . but  you have to be eighteen,  i think, to drive. and it's expensive here soi .o k.after this interview?  i'm going home.  i'm going home and eat dinner. and study. thank you.
