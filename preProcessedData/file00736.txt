. I've been to Vancouver.
 and two years ago and four years ago.
Twice.
. Yes. first time I visited Vancouver, not exactly Vancouver I went to Nanaimo Island,
near Vancouver.
 I couldn't speak English I couldn't understand Canadian people. And I went to there with many young Japanese girls. So I didn't enjoy the real Canada.
But the second time when I was the high school student in the second grade, so I improved my English . and with few Japanese girls, so almost around me was people from all around the world. So I was enjoy the real Canada. And Vancouver is modern more modern than the Nanaimo. So I could enjoy shopping and sightseeing, too.

O K. One day last week, three students went to see a movie. And before the movie started, they bought something to eat. And they were looking forward to seeing that. On the movie, there is a scene the airplane was burning. And they were so shocked. And because before that, they saw America's terrorism in New York. So they were so scared. they enjoy that movie very much. And they talked about what they thought about the movie. and also they started to think about the terrorism more deeply.
Yes. not so often. But I like to see .
. . but especially, recently, I like action movies.
 because it is very good refreshment for me. I saw "Driven," you know, the that very much.
The car crashing. . So maybe many people feel that that is very scared. But for me, it is exciting.

. go to coffee shop to drink some coffee. Or go to restaurant to eat something with friend.
.
.
I'm going to go back to my home and cook. . I'm planning to cook .
,
. Yeah.
.
.
Thank you.
