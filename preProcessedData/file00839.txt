O K. one day last week, Mary and her sister plan to go camping together.
And they really enjoyed to prepare for the camping, and they bought a lot of things for the camping, and they tried to carry them with their car. And the car was a yellow one, her sister's. And they went to camp, and the place was near the river. And, as soon as they get there, they started to make a tent by themselves. And also, at the same time, they prepared for their lunch. But, suddenly, it started to rain, and they were really surprised because the weather forecast didn't say that. The weather forecast did say it would be sunny all day.
. no, really suddenly, the big wind blew. And they were so surprised, and they rushed to their car. And they tried to get on it again.
And they made their things together, and they decided to go home. But, on the way at home, they found a hotel which name was Hotel Cosmos. So, as the rain was getting stronger, so they decided to stay that hotel.
 and, at the hotel, they really got relaxed. And although they couldn't do the camping, but they enjoyed their time to get relaxed at that hotel.
