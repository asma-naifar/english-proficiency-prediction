One day last week,   a woman went to  shopping. And she bought   her blouse. And      once, she decided to go home. But she thought   she wanted to give her husband because      her husband birthday  was coming. So she wanted to buy her husband some present. So she  back to the department store. She bought her husband a   tie. And     she was leaving the department store. She found   shoes. And the shoes is discounted. Thirty percent off. So   she wanted to buy and she  bought some shoes.

 I went to Utah,
 Salt Late City. They are very   suburb.
So   there were not so many shops. And  I like Utah because air is clean,
and the people is very kind.
And there were not so many dangerous area like  Los Angeles or New York city.
. But on Sunday, there were no buses or trains. So if I want to go anywhere,  I call the taxi. It's very  unuseful.
