One day last week, a man in a orange car was driving along as usual. <F>Um</F> then <F>well</F> when he was driving, a man on a scooter came along from the opposite direction. And he was <SC>use his mo</SC> using his mobile phone whilst he was driving a scooter. <F>Er</F> because the man using his scooter, he wasn't looking where he was going, and he hit the man in the orange car. <F>Er</F> when the man on the scooter hit the orange car, he dropped his mobile phone. And his mobile phone broke. The man on the scooter claimed that <SC>the reason</SC> <F>er</F> the person <F>er</F> <SC>who was bad</SC> <F>er</F> who was responsible for this accident was the man in the orange car. So the man on the orange car called the police and told the police that the man on the scooter had been <F>er</F> using his mobile phone whilst he was in the scooter. And it was obviously the man on the scooter's fault that the accident happened. <F>Um</F> so the policeman took a whole <SC?>s</SC?> notes down and he said that he would like to see both of them in court the next week.So the story ends and the man who was on the scooter watches his scooter being taken away for repairs.<CO>Cell</CO>?<OL><F>Oh</F> yes</OL>.
