When he actually does our class, he faces the blackboard instead of us. Somost of the time he's talking towards the blackboard, not to us.Yeah.<nvs>smack</nvs> First grade.<F>Urm</F> it's all right. I mean, I guess <SC>it's like</SC> it's the best for me <SC>com</SC> <F>eh</F> for a Japanese high school. But I would've gotten a higher level of education <SC?>eve</SC?> if I went to private <SC>hi</SC> <F>ur</F> international school like <F>ur</F> I C U, for example.<nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> there's a financial situation of my parents.So <F>well</F> I would have prefered to go into like an American school here.That would've done <F>mm</F> much better for me. <CO>But</CO>.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I'd been in the U S for thirteen years <OL>so</OL>I'm planning on going to university <SC>for U S</SC><F>ur</F> in the U S.<CO>So</CO>.<nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> it's my parents' <F>ur</F> <SC>business</SC> job situation.<OL>My dad</OL> is a pastor and he <F>ur</F> worked there. He <F>ur</F> opened a church there and he <F>ur</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> preached the Gospel, the message to <F>ur</F> Japanese business men, that <?>lead</?> business men who come and go in the U S.<F>Ur</F> I don't know. He's very <F>urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> conservative.And so he'd be very like strict compare to <F>ur</F> any other Japanese parents.<OL><F>Urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs></OL> Yes. For example, like he only use the computer for under an hour. Right? And we do not have a T V in my house.So that sort of example, I guess.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>. <F>Ur</F> my mom is a pastor's wife. That's her occupation.<F>Urm</F> but what exactly do you want me to tell you about?My mother?<F>Urm</F> her real name <SC>is</SC> <F>ur</F> was <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And <F>hm</F> I don't know. <F>Ur</F> her birthday is <F>ur</F> <SC>November the</SC> <F>ur</F> wait, October the thirtieth. And my birthday is November the first. So we usually have <F>ur</F> one big birthday together <OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Mm</F>.Why.<OL><F>Urm</F></OL> why.<F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> <SC>he <F>urm</F> likes</SC> ever since he was young, he wanted to become a professional piano player.And so what's it, <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>he spent his <F>ur</F> i</SC> his mother was a widow ever since he was born. So <F>urm</F> <SC?>was</SC?> the family <SC>the</SC> <R>they</R> they were very poor. So <F>ur</F> <R>he</R> he wanted to be a piano player since he was like <nvs>sniff</nvs> maybe twelve. And so he finally got his first piano at like age twenty-one. And <F>oh</F> right after that, he went to France in order to study piano. But <F>urm</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> I don't know, I think <SC>he went there and</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>oh</F> wait, no, no, no, yeah, he went to France first, right? And he found like a lot of problems there.Like he found like a limit to his extent of like knowledge and skill in piano.So and then he came back to Japan, and then he heard the Gospel there. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <nvs>smack</nvs> then he decided to become a pastor.<CO>So</CO>.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL> before that, he got baptized first. <CO>But</CO>.<F>Mm</F>.<nvs>smack</nvs> <nvs>sigh</nvs> Let me see.

One is a cat which is on the bed. One is a dog which is on the ground. And there is a Asian student, I suppose, <F>er</F> using a computer. And next to computer, there is a typewriter. And these two <F>ur</F> typing instruments are on the <SC>k</SC> desk.In America?<F>Urm</F> let me see. I wouldn't have a computer, typewriter or speaker system.I'd have a bed, a desk and a <SC>shelf full of books</SC><F>ur</F> I mean <F>ur</F> book case full of books.<.></.> That'll be it. <OL><?>Yes</?></OL>.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I suppose like this is supposed to be my mother country.But I don't get used to or I don't <F>ur</F> get along with Japanese people or Japanese students of my ageas much as I would with American people or American students.So that's one big thing.And it's also a thing about citizenship.Like I feel like I belong in the U S, but my passport tells me otherwise. So it's a little hard thing.<nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Well</F> here, you know, it's <F>ur</F> exception like <F>ur</F> I have a friend from Russia and I also have a friend from the U S who's been there for five years. <nvs>sniff</nvs> So there's lots of English-speaking people and I get along with people who can speak English.So that works out well. <nvs>sniff</nvs><OL>And</OL> yeah, <SC>I'm getting</SC> I've been learning to get along with people <SC?>wu</SC?> the other Japanese as well. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<nvs>smack</nvs> What do I miss most about America? <F>Urm</F> I don't know.
