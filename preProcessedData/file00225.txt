Good afternoon.
Yeah, my name is .
Yes, please. 
Yeah,  very fine.
 it's raining. 
No.    I'm working  near , near .
 I'm engineer.  specially,    design a  civil engineering structure.
Like tunnel or subway station, underground structure.
.   This building?
?
.
Yeah. But  I didn't know    they were rebuilt.    actually,   I went there yesterday and I was very surprised to see    it was  .
. But it's very      very beautiful, but for structure,  there were nothing new.  Nothing special.
.   no.  That's good enough. 
Good. 
 I live in     with my parents.
.  It's difficult.      yes, both of them  are working. Yeah. My father works for a  chemical company and my mother is a part-time job. And she works at      like a department store.
  some of them are comfortable. 
And, yes.   I feel comfortable at home, but     to come to the office or to go home,   the train is very crowded. That's  tough. Very hard.
Yes  sometimes,   now,  I'm  reading a book,  especially English book. 
But    I think my job will be getting more  busier, so, I think, in the train, I'll be sleeping. 
 unpleasant.   yes,   I take a subway and   on the  halfway,   it runs above the ground, but the rest,  it runs under the ground, so,   I can't see  outside from window.
That's very unpleasant for me.
 yes. I think this is the same   .

.
 it's new.  ?    I ?
 yes.        I think it's not in Japan, because of    house is very large and   there is no fence between house and road.           and it has a  large garden  next to the building. And children are playing volleyball or something there. .  . And  it's sunny, so,   old man are reading paper  on the bench and a young man are    jogging  along the street. .  Two womens are talking about something. And one of them are  with her dog.  . 
 yes.    with this   English program,  I lived in San Francisco .
Yes.
Yes.  I lived downtown in San Francisco.  it has more     downhill, , up, down.
Yes. And  I heard the prices of land is very high in San Francisco. So, the houses are .
And   it very  foggy.
So, we don't see sun  many time.
Yes.
.
. I don't think so.
O K.
O K.
Yes, I want to go to New York,    as  fast as possible. And           what time does the fastest train go?
.
.
In three hours. . Three o'clock. So, yeah, do you mean it's a   fastest train to get to New York?
No?
.   so, how about that local train? .
So,  if I want to get the local train, what time will I get to  New York?
Twelve thirty?
 .   what   if I take a  express?
? Twelve o'clock.
And  it takes three hours?
In three hours. .
O K.    how much are    express train and local train?
. O K. So,   I'd like to  take a express train.
 only  one.
For me.
. Thank you. .
O K. 
Thank you.
.
Yes.   I don't think  it's called train, but it's called Muni Metro. Muni Metro or Muni Bus.   yes. Because  it runs on the street     and actually,  I go to school  by train.
 That's a hard question.
  in San Francisco, it's not very crowded. Of course, it's not crowded but    it often  out of order. .   it suddenly stops and,  yes, and one thing I mention is  I didn't know what time will the next train come, and how long will it take to get somewhere.   so,   it's difficult. 
.
.
.
O K.   one day last week,   a woman found  there was nothing in the refrigerator. And so,   she went to supermarket   to get some food and some drink  by her car.  . And   she bought many things   at the supermarket.  And    she paid by cash.  And   her car  was not so big    but  she carried  what she bought   with her car.  she  put them  in the trunk of her car. And when she got home,   she cooked      with egg, what she bought. 
 sometimes. 
Yes. Because  I lived with my   classmates. .
? ?
When  I was in San Francisco.
Yeah.
Roommate. And  he cooked  for me.  So, I didn't cook   so often.
And, of course,   now I live with my parents, so, I don't cook.
. Yes.   when  I'm home,   there are many things in our refrigerator.
And    now I'm outside,   there's many stores and many shops anywhere. So,  I don't need to cook  by myself. 
Today? Yes. I had no time  because       in the afternoon,  we'll have a office trip.  So  today, we have only half a day  to work so,  it was very busy. So,  I said   I was working at . I took a bus from there to .
And in the bus, I took  lunch.
