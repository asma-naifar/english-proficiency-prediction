. Because of the story and the little bit vague.
I don't know what they wanted to let us know.
. .

Decide?
 first of all, depending on what I wanted to buy. And second is the price. So if the price is cheaper than usual I bought a so.
 pardon?
 usually I go to local supermarket.
But sometimes, when I go to urban area, I often department store. And food department of department store is very very amazing for me. So a lot of foods and a lot of seasoning and a lot of, something new. And I really enjoy.
