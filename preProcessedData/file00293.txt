Good bye.
  actually I like movies,
very much. But  as you know ,  the charge of   movie ticket is very .
And the movie theater is very crowded. So I   go to theater.   I actually watch  on the video tape.
Last movie? . A few days ago, I saw  "American Beauty". "American Beauty" was very famous. And  I'm so   excited  to watch it. But,  I was a little bit disappointed. . 
. Because      the story and the    theme of film maker    little bit vague.
I don't know   what they   wanted to  let us know.
. .
  in the order one, two, three?
. .  .      I looked into  a refrigerator. And , there is   no foods    in the   refrigerator. So I decided to go to supermarket. And I went to supermarket by my car.   and    I looked around supermarket, and bought  what I wanted. And       I finished the check. Then    I took   my bags  to the car  and   take my baggage into the car. And then I drove back to the home.    then    I cooked     some  egg's dish and      maybe stew or ,  another dishes for my family.
Yes.
.
Decide?
 first of all,     depending on  what I wanted to buy. And second is  the price.  So if the price is cheaper than usual   I bought a  lot of,   so.
 pardon?
 Yes.  usually  I go to  local supermarket.
But sometimes,    when I go to    urban area,   I often  go to  department store. And     food department of department store   is very very  amazing for me.  So a lot of foods and a lot of  seasoning and a lot of,   something new. And   I really enjoy. 
.
After this?   I go back to home.
And  after  taking a break a little,      I will study. 
.
Thank you very much.
Good bye.
