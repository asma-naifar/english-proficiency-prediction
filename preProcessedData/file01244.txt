<OL>O K</OL>.My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Nice meeting you.I'm doing fine.But I have a <SC?>really</SC?> <SC>slightly</SC> slight headache.I guess so. I have to because it's <F>ur</F> really busy time <OL>for us</OL><OL>right now because</OL> we have a deadline coming soon.I'm selling advertisement to the schools overseas.<F>Ur</F> in major English speaking countries, <F>ur</F> especially in <?>the</?> United States and Canada.And <F>ur</F> because <F>ur</F> there is a <SC>advertise</SC> <R>ad</R> advertisement space in <R>the</R> <F>ur</F> the series of the <R>st</R> study abroad guide booksfor Japanese students.And <F>ur</F> so <SC>advertisers</SC> <F>ur</F> most of the advertisers are schools who is <F>ur</F> seeking for the Japanese student into their <SC>coun</SC> <F>ur</F> universities and colleges. And also language schools.I think so because I prefer to communicate with the people outside the Japan.So basically <SC>I li</SC> I'd like to live in <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> different countries,experiencing a different cultureand people, the way of thinking and living.And that's exciting <OL>a lot</OL>.<R>So</R> so I wish <SC>I could bou</SC> I could go back to <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Urm</F> first <F>ur</F> three years and half, I lived in <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> like a <F>mm</F> suburban area on <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.Like <F>ur</F> twenty minutes <F>ur</F> <SC>away from</SC> <F>ur</F> north of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>by car.And so but it's already a kind of very rural setting. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So you have to have the carto live there. Otherwise you can't survive. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>So <F>urm</F> but I quite often go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> by train.But <F>ur</F> train service <SC>is</SC> <F>ur</F> yeah, is just <SC?>a one some</SC?> an hour. So and it's <R>ka</R> kind of very slow train. So it's takes nearly fifty minutes to get to the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <R?>ce</R?> <?>you know</?> <SC><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></SC> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. So it's not really convenient.<F>Urm</F> because <F>ur</F> it's so energetic.I feel energy when I step in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, <F>urm</F> immediately <R>I fee</R> I feel <R>en</R> energy of the people living there. And <F>ur</F> they are really active.And <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>auk</SC> <R>als</R> also very focussed.<F>Urm</F> many of the people <SC>s</SC> <F>ur</F> working there have <SC>their</SC> like <F>ur</F> their objectivesclearly.<R>And</R> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> and <F>ur</F> making efforts to achieve them.So I feel energy of those people and I like that.<F>Ur</F> since this is my mother country,I can't say I don't like it here.<laughter>So</laughter> it's O K to live herebecause I'm, anyway, Japanese.And my <F>ur</F> parents are also living here.<SC>So for them, <R>it's</R> <F>ur</F> it's</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>for them, it's really hap</SC> for them, they're very happy because <SC>I'm here</SC> I came back here and <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> since especially because I'm a only child.<F>Urm</F> so they're really happy <F>urm</F> because I came back.<nvs>laughter</nvs> But to me, <F>urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> it's <F>ur</F> not really so exciting so if I could go back to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> or maybe <SC>I</SC> now I prefer to live some country in a Europe.Yeah.<OL>Something different</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Ur</F> people are skiing. And also <F>er</F> <?>someone</?> does the snowboard <SC>and</SC> though little children are enjoying <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> playing, <F>ur</F> throwing a snowballs <R>with</R> with each other. And also the young people are skiing <R>and the</R> <F>ur</F> and <SC>the some peop</SC> one person in the field on the snow <F>ur</F> the <F>ur</F> asking for help. And also there is the snowman here. And <SC?>I c</SC?> <F>ur</F> a few people are having <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> coffee inside <SC?>ja</SC?> the log house.<.></.><OL>Yeah</OL>, I think <R><laughter>tha</laughter></R> that's all. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Not really,<OL><laughter>actually</laughter></OL>.<laughter><nvs>laughter</nvs></laughter>I think <R>I'm</R> I'm healthy by nature.And I seldom get cold.And so <F>ur</F> without doing anything, I just stay healthy.So but <F>ur</F> because of my age, I guess, <R>I</R> I started to gain my weight. <nvs>laughter</nvs>So actually just yesterday, I just joined a sports club.Because I really feel I have to do some exercise <F>ur</F> you know, daily basis.So <R>to</R> to keep my health <R>to</R> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to the future <?>because</?> I'm getting old and have to keep my health.And <F>ur</F> so I can't count on just myself doing without anything.<OL>And</OL> so I think I really need <R>a</R> a little exercise <OL>with the daily basis</OL>.I have to pay the fee.And the monthly fee and <F>ur</F> there're like <F>ur</F> handling fee.And also I had to write down the application. And <F>ur</F> but it's wouldn't open until <F>ur</F> the first of April <OL>actually</OL>.It's right in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> where I'm living.So it's pretty close to my apartment so the accessibility is <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> most important to me. It has to be in my vicinity<OL>so that I</OL> can go there quite often <F>ur</F> even after I work.And <F>ur</F> so <R>usually</R> usually I finish working like <F>ur</F> <SC>eight o'clock</SC> at eight thirty at night. So after that, even just a little bit, maybe I just go to the sports club and do some exercise for the fifteen minutes or twenty minutes, <OL><laughter>I don't know</laughter></OL>.And go home.Yeah.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mhm</F>. <..></..> <JP>Hai</JP>.Yes.Yes, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes. <OL><CO>Ho</CO></OL>.Yes, I'm doing fine. How are you?<F>Oh</F> yes. I'm <SC>s</SC> very sorry that I couldn't make itbecause <F>ur</F> I had a bad <R>headach</R> headache and <F>ur</F> I think I had a cold.And I feel feverso I thought I shouldn't go there because <F>ur</F> maybe <F>urm</F> some other people catch cold from me. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.Yes, I'm really sorry about that.But please invite me <?>the</?> next opportunity.<OL>Really</OL>?<OL><F>Wow</F></OL>.<F>Wow</F>.<F>Oh</F> that's a really surprise to me, too. I didn't expect that you're gonna hold a surprise party <OL>for me</OL>.<F>Ur</F> I have never experienced that such a thing. So <R>I</R> I have no idea. <F>Urm</F> in that case, <R>maybe</R> <F>urm</F> maybe I have to ask some other people that to bring the <SC>c</SC> some cake <R>to</R> to my apartment. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>And <F>ur</F> I really <R>apologize</R> apologize for that.<OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yeah.

Not in Japan.But when I was living in the United States, yes, sometimes I did.<F>Urm</F> but it's not something really special, but just bring some cooking <F>ur</F> or <F>ur</F> sweets to the friend's house.And like a it's a potluck party.And <F>ur</F> just <F>ur</F> <R>we</R> we enjoy chatting with <R>ea</R> each other and playing some little games <SC?>and</SC?>yeah. And just being with <F>ur</F> close friend, <F>ur</F> it's really enjoyable.<CO>So</CO>.Yeah.Right. <F>Urm</F> I think American people really like to surprise people.Yes. Like <F>ur</F> you said, <F>ur</F> like <F>ur</F> <R>they</R> they really like to plan like a surprise party.<F>Urm</F> even for the colleagues.Even <SC>the</SC> not the member of the family, even just for colleagues, and also of course for the close friends or lovers,<OL><F>urm</F></OL> you know. <F>Ur</F> they often set up a surprise party and <F>ur</F> so give a big surprise to the loved one. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>So I think that's a big difference.<F>Ur</F> <SC>I haven't heard from</SC> <F>mm</F> at least among my <F>ur</F> Japanese friends,I haven't heard they planned a surprise party <SC>for their clo</SC> for their friends or family. <CO>So</CO>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<R>One day last week</R>,<F>oh</F> one day last week, <F>ur</F> <.></.> <SC>a young a</SC> <SC>ya</SC> a young man driving a car.
