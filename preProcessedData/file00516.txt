 I like travel. So I go driving somewhere with my friends. And I like movies.
So I don't have so much money, so I can't go a theater so often. So almost I watch movies in home with video.
 all kind.
Yeah. Especially, action movies.
 in my laboratory, I study. So it's difficult problems. So action movies is very simple story.
So I can relax with seeing movies.

 in Thailand, we don't cost so much. foods and drink and trains is very cheap. Of course, to get scuba diving. Bangkok is not clean. It's very crowded and traffic light.
