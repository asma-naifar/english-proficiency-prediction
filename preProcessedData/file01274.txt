Good morning.O K. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL>Nice to</OL> meet you.Sure.<F>Er</F> I'm fine, because it's a nice day.<F>Well</F> I have a job, so <R>I</R> I can't go out very often. But when I have free time, I go to the gym and shape myself.Yes. <SC>I go</SC> <F>well</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and I go to the public gym. <F>Er</F> it's called <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <JP>shimin taiku-kan</JP>. And I go there <F>er</F> <F>er</F> by car. And there is a big parking lot so we can park our car. And I take <F>um</F> like gym training. At first I do stretching and then I walk and run on the route. And then I come back to the room and I do machine training.<F>Oh</F> it was long time ago, when I had a baby and one day I looked at my body in my mirror, and I got so shocked because my body shape was kind of terrible.<laughter>So I decided to go to gym</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> <SC>after that</SC> after three months, I felt some kind of change <R>in</R> in my body shape and <F>urm</F> I was very happy about that. And <SC>I just</SC> <R>I</R> I just keep doing it.<F>Um</F> <F>well</F> I like to listen to music or I like to read some books at home or if I have free time, <F>well</F> I can go to somewhere to have lunch with my friends <OL>or mother</OL><R>o</R> or I go to my parents' house.Yes.<F>Er</F> they live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> and I can go there by car in twenty minutes. <SC>It's</SC> it depends on the traffic situation but I can go there, I guess <F>er</F> we have lunch together sometimes.<F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> I feel like they still think that I am their kid.And when I go to lunch, some place like expensive restaurant, they still <R>wan</R> want to pay <OL>for me</OL>.<OL>And</OL> they sometimes buy me some nice clothes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><laughter>Yes</laughter>.<F>Um</F> almost the same. But actually my mom told me that <F>er</F> for her, <F>er</F> I am really important <SC>like</SC> than my child.<OL><R>I</R></OL> I don't know why. Because I am her daughter and my daughter is mine.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Eh</F> <OL>big difference</OL>.<F>Uh</F> yes. She is now fifteen years old. And she is <F>er</F> very active and very cute <OL>for me</OL>.And she is one of the members of her <?>charity</?> at school.She's very active <OL><??></??></OL>.And <F>well</F> since I'm busy I need her help and sometimes she prepares dinner for me.<??></??>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><?>Thank you</?></OL>.Yes. <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I guess this is a classroom in high school. And a female teacher is explaining charts or something on that board. Maybe this is the math class. And the students are not really concentrating on the class. <F>Er</F> only one students <F>uh</F> sitting <SC>in</SC> just in front of the teacher is learning very seriously but <SC>the other</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>next student, <F>er</F> he is</SC> <F>er</F> the boy next to the serious guy is like <SC>watching</SC> looking <SC>at the</SC> <F>ur</F> out the window. And the girl next to him is sending E-mails on the cellphone. And two girls are <F>well</F> maybe talking about fashion or something. And <F>er</F> one guy is listening to music and drinking something even in the class.<F>Well</F> my daughter now goes to a private school so she wears like a school uniform everyday. So <F>oh</F> O K. When I was a junior high school student, I went to public a school but I had a school uniform. And <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> my daughter is interested in fashion now, so she buys lot of fashion magazinesevery week.But I was not interested in fashion at all. I was just playing tennis everyday.<F>Hm</F>. And <??></??> <F>er</F> differences <R>in</R> in the classroom?<F>Um</F> I don't know exactly what's going on in her class because I don't have any chances to go to her class and observe the class. So <R>I</R> I can't tell. But according to her story, everybody is studying seriously but sometimes she falls off asleep, <R>she</R> <R>she</R> she says to me. Because the school is far from my house. So maybe it's a lot of work for her to take a bus and train to go to school. And <F>well</F> that's it.<F>Ah</F> <F>well</F> until high school, I guess, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think so. <OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Um</F> <SC>after that</SC> <F>well</F> maybe until twenty years old, <F>um</F> I guess it's <F>er</F> our responsibility to take a look <SC>a her</SC> at her life and <F>um</F> <R>I need to</R> I need to support her <OL>as much as possible</OL>.And if she goes out with <R>some</R> someone bad,and <R>if she star</R> if she starts to go out with someone bad to Shibuya or Shinjuku, <F>well</F> maybe we can <F>er</F> discipline her <F>um</F> with the problem by looking at her appearance.<OL>Like <F>er</F></OL> her makeup orfashionor something. I need to check that.O K.O K.O K. I'm ready.<F>Er</F> yes, please. <F>Um</F> I was supposed to be here twenty minutes ago but <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I got in a traffic jam. I was in a taxi. So <F>um</F> I missed the train. Could you <F>er</F> give me another ticket for the next train?I know. But it was not my fault. I was in a taxi. <R>I</R> <F>well</F> I didn't do anything about that. I need to go to <F>er</F> Tokyo Station as soon as possible. I need to go there.Sure. <??></??> <F>oh</F> sorry?<OL><F>Um</F></OL> no, no. It was an <F>er</F> <SC>traffic accident</SC> <?>on</?> car accidents. And <F>er</F> the police car came and the police officers were <F>um</F> checking the sites. And it took about thirty minutes. So <F>er</F> we couldn't move at all.<OL><F>Well</F> maybe</OL> <SC>you can check the T</SC> <F>well</F> you can turn on a T V and you can get some information about the accident.<OL><F>Uh</F> I guess</OL> I have a right reason <OL>to get a ticket</OL>.<F>Ah</F> <F>oh</F> my God. Are there any way that I can go to Tokyo Station?<F>Oh</F> it's O K. I can standby.Yes.<OL>O K</OL>. Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.Yes. <F>Er</F> once <F>er</F> I went to Australia for our honeymoon.And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>we went</SC> we had a chance to live in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <SC>for</SC> because of my husband's job. It was <??></??>. My daughter was in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.So she has two passports.<H pn="others3">XXX05</H>? <F>Well</F> traffic <F>er</F> system. I think <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> is a kind of suburb. My husband office is <R?>in</R?> in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>. So he had to take a commuter bus to <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> everyday. <SC?>Als</SC?> and the system for <F>er</F> business people <OL><SC>in</SC></OL>living in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.And <SC>the road was <SC>quite</SC> <F>er</F> not really</SC> <F>well</F> <F>er</F> I didn't <SC>ex</SC> <?>or</?> experience that kind of heavy traffic like in Tokyo.And I used car everyday for shopping. But we didn't <?>get</?> any accident or traffic jam at all. <OL>So</OL><??></??>Yes.<F>Um</F> so far, I can't think of any disadvantages. But <F>er</F> I guess <F>oh</F> for her <SC>advantages are</SC> <F>uh</F> not the advantages are she can go to American school <F>er</F> if she goes to America as an American citizen.And I guess it's much cheaper thangoing thereas a Japanese student.Yeah. She can get a job as soon as possible <OL>when she</OL> gets there.And so far she has two passports. But <F>er</F> at some points in her life, she has to make a decision.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. O K.<OL>O K</OL>.O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, two girls planned to the camping. And <F>er</F> they are preparing for the camp and <F>eh</F> there are a lot of things for the camp. And they put the stuff into the car. And <F>er</F> when <?>arrived</?> at the campsite, they started to set up the tent by the lake or river or I don't know. And they started to cook something <?>on the ground</?>.And <F>er</F> all of the sudden, it started to rain. <R>And</R> and then <F>er</F> the weather changed a lot. And <F>er</F> it was extremely windy and the camp stuff <F>er</F> was scattered everywhere and they finally gave up <F>er</F> to stay there. And then they got in a car. <SC>And s</SC> in a thunder <R>s</R> storm, they started to go somewhere. And on the way to somewhere, they found a motor hotel by the road. And they decided to stay there. And they ended up <SC?>in</SC?> <F>er</F> staying in a hotel room and looking out outside <laughter>from the room</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.No. Not at all.Yes. <F>Um</F> actually long time ago, I liked <F>er</F> playing tennis. And I joined a tennis club and play tennis a lot every week. But <F>er</F> maybe in <F>er</F> late twenties, I gave up <F>er</F> enjoying outdoor because <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I didn't want to get aging spot any more. My skin is so weak. <SC>Maybe I'm aller</SC> <F>mm</F> my skin's <F>mm</F> is allergic to ultraviolet,I guess.And actually, <F>er</F> it's from my mother. My mother has also <SC>the fine skin</SC> weak skin. And in the last several years, she had a skin cancer on her face. It was not so serious. <SC>So</SC> but she had to get rid of the spots at the hospital. And it was a kind of <SC>s</SC> like surgery. And <R>I</R> I don't want to get that kind of <SC>s</SC> cancer <F>uh</F> on my face.So <SC>I need to</SC> I need sunscreen anyways to <?>a</?> summer outside. Or <SC?>I pre</SC?> <F>well</F> I take my <SC>umbrella with me</SC> <F>uh</F> umbrella or parasol to prevent my skin <F>er</F> from sunshine.Yes. <F>Er</F> actually <F>er</F> I have a plan to go with my mom to Shibuya to have lunch.<OL>And after</OL> that <F>well</F> maybe we can enjoy <F>er</F> window shopping or shopping.Yes.Yes.Sometimes my father is at home. <SC>She</SC> <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he doesn't like to go shopping,<OL><?>you know</?></OL>. And if we go shopping together, <R>he</R> he has to wait at <OL>somewhere</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> And he complains a lot about that. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Right. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Thank you.
