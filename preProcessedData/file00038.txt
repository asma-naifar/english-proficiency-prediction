I paid twenty thousand yen, and he gave me     one moment.    before I bought it,  I asked him, "Please  package the necktie for present,"  and  I paid the   cash and I received a necktie. Ands after then, I want to  buy my dresses. And I asked him, "Where is   woman's dresses  sale?". . A man said,  "It's a third  floor.". And I went to upstairs and I bought my dresses.
 .  I didn't go to alone. . I always  go to with my husband.
Because my husbands  isn't so nice.
 I didn't decided   which necktie is a best for him. And     I decides      my husband's
