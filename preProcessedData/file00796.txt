My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yeah.I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.No. I'm living <R>by</R> by myself.I just moved into <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <SC>three day</SC> <F>er</F> three weeks ago. And <F>ur</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>bic</SC> I don't like <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the area because <SC>I have to</SC> I had to move to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Yeah. Because I was living <R>wi</R> with my friend. <SC>She is a</SC> from <F>err</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <??></??> friend. And we were living together. But <R>she</R> <F>er</F> she decided to get married. So <F>err</F> <R>she</R> she said she wants to move out. And <SC>I cannot</SC> I couldn't pay the rent.So I have to find a new place.So I moved into <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And I thought <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is much much better than <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> which I lived before because it's <F>ur</F> more convenient. But <F>ur</F> I don't like the place because it's too noisy.And <F>er</F> <R>the</R> <SC>the sunshine</SC> I can not see the <OL>sunshine</OL> during the daytime.<OL>And</OL> the air is not so good.<F>Um</F> I study political science.What about political science? <SC>I</SC> <F>err</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>err</F> about <F>ur</F> international relationship. And I <F>err</F> study about the you know <F>err</F> classic <F>err</F> political book like "Plato" or "Aristotle". And also I <F>er</F> study about <R>the</R> the political scientists <F>err</F> such as <F>err</F> <F>err</F> <?>Raswell</?> or <F>err</F> I can not remember. <CO>But I should remember the name of <R>the</R> the</CO>. <F>Err</F>.<F>Er</F>. My future plan is <F>err</F> <F>urm</F> I like to study about the E U and also international relationship and the international <F>err</F> <F>er</F> <F>err</F> <F>er</F> politics. And <F>er</F> I'd like to go to graduate school, too.And after that, maybe I'd like to do some kind of <R>N</R> N G O activity.Actually I don't have <F>er</F> much free time this moment. Because <SC>I'm</SC> once I graduate from junior college, and I had worked <R>for</R> <F>er</F> for company for ten years. And then I came back to university again. So <F>uum</F> I'm working also after school.<OL>And</OL> I'm doing small business with my friend.So <R>maybe</R> maybe <F>err</F> <SC>the</SC> <SC>like</SC> <SC>my</SC> <SC>in free time</SC> if I have free time, I'd like to read the book. But at this moment, I don't havemuch free time. <OL>I have to work</OL>.Yes.O K. <F>Uum</F>. It seems to be a <F>er</F> high school class <F>er</F> in suburb of Tokyo. <F>Er</F> <F>err</F>. And a teacher is teaching mathematics. But <SC>none of them</SC>, <F>er</F> maybe <F>er</F> most of them are listening to her. And only one boy is listening to her <F>er</F> eagerly. But other person <F>er</F> are just chatting or <F>urm</F> drinking something or <R>ma</R> maybe <F>er</F> <F>err</F> sending the e-mail <R>to</R> to friends or <F>ur</F> chewing gum. And then <F>er</F> this class <SC>seems to be a</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> seems <SC>to be</SC> not to be very good class.<SC>In my high school days, <R>it's</R> <F>err</F> it's quite different from</SC> <F>er</F> my high school days is quite different from <R>this</R> this class.Because <F>ur</F> <SC>the</SC> first of all, <SC>I ha</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>we have a</SC> we had a <SC>uniform</SC> school uniform. So everybody was wearing the same <F>er</F> navy <F>um</F> <F>ee</F> school uniform. And also <F>err</F> the teacher was very strict. And <SC>the te</SC> our teacher didn't allow us to <SC>do some</SC> do <F>er</F> some kind of <F>er</F> e-mail stuff because first of all, I didn't have mobile phone when <laughter>I was</laughter> high school. and also <F>err</F> our teacher didn't allow us to chat with my friend. And <F>er</F> we are not allowed to bring any food or drink in a class room at all.And it's quite different. And also <SC>hair</SC> their hair style is very different from us.O K.O K.<OL>O K</OL>.I'm sorry <R>I</R> <F>um</F> I have some question regarding the tour I joined <F>err</F> <F>um</F> three days ago.<F>Err</F> <F>um</F>. <R>Do</R> <SC>do you</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> would you just tell me why <SC>that</SC> <SC>the</SC> our hotel rooms were not ready at that time? Because <F>err</F> when we arrived at the hotel, <SC>the</SC> our tour leader told us that our hotel room <SC>was</SC> <R>were</R> were not ready yet. And I have to wait for hours.So <F>err</F> I don't know <R>what kind of</R> <F>err</F> what kind of <F>err</F> agent you are using <R>at</R> <F>er</F> <SC>at the</SC> <.></.> <F>err</F> in Hawaii.Now but <F>er</F> <SC>if it's</SC> the problem of the hotel <F>err</F> <F>err</F> <R>we</R> we can understand, but I've heard that <SC>hotel was</SC> that hotel person was saying our tour <R>lead</R> leader that <F>er</F> <F>er</F> they can not find our names on the <SC>list</SC> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> you know, reservation list. So I thought there is some kind of mistake <R>between</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> between the <F>er</F> hotel reservation and the local agent, I think.And that <R>made</R> made us to <R>wait</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> wait at the hotel for hours. And <SC>the</SC> <F>err</F> <R>we</R> <F>um</F> <R>we</R> <R>we lost our</R> <F>um</F> we lost our time to go to shopping.So <.></.> I think <F>err</F> <F>uum</F> <.></.> your <SC>agent</SC> local agent is not so good.And <F>err</F> it's not only this case. <F>Err</F>. <SC>Because</SC> <F>um</F> and also in the <F>err</F> <R>f</R> <F>er</F> flier, <SC>we ha</SC> we could have a <SC>good</SC> <F>err</F> very gorgeous dinner, but <R>the</R> the content of dinner was not so good.And the quality of the food was very bad. And <F>ur</F> we paid a lot of money on this tour, but <F>er</F> <F>er</F> it's seems like a very very cheap <R>inex</R> inexpensive tour.I think <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> frankly speaking, I want you give me some money back.O K. <CO>So when <R>can I</R> <OL>can I</OL></CO>.In ten minutes.O K.O K.<..></..> Problem?<F>Er</F>. Yes. <R>I have</R> <F>er</F> <SC>I have a</SC> <F>er</F> I had a trouble <R>wi</R> <F>uum</F> with my <F>er</F> the <SC>car</SC> rental car. I rent a car in Australia.And that the car <F>err</F> was not so in a good condition. So when I was <SC>tr</SC> <F>um</F> driving, <R>the</R> the inside of the car, I smell something burn.<OL>And</OL> I think like <F>er</F> <R>s</R> something is burning and so like <F>er</F> smoky inside.So I called the <F>ur</F> rent a car company, and I asked them to change the car.Dangerous. <nvs>laughter</nvs>O K.<F>Er</F>. One day last week, <F>uum</F> <F>uum</F> <.></.> I went to the station to <R>go to</R> go to work. <F>Err</F>. And I was carrying my briefcase. <F>Ur</F>. And in that brief case, there was important documents. And then <F>er</F> when I was standing on the platform, the person next to me hit me with his elbow. And I dropped my briefcase <F>err</F> <SC>underneath the</SC> <F>ee</F> on the <R>rail</R> railway underneath the platform. And then <F>err</F> we argued. I asked him to just take it back. But <R>he</R> <F>err</F> he said that he doesn't know. And it's not his fault, he said. And then train came. And train just <F>ur</F> went through <F>er</F> over my briefcase. And <SC>I was so</SC> I felt <F>uum</F> that my bag is going to be <F>er</F> <F>uum</F> <F>er</F> <SC>broken</SC> crashed. And then after <R>train</R> train passed through <F>um</F> <R>briefca</R> briefcase <R>was</R> <F>er</F> was there as it was. And <SC>then <F>uum</F> the</SC> <..></..> then <SC>I felt</SC> <F>um</F> I was relieved. And then <F>err</F> I asked the person <F>err</F> who was in the platform which is the train company employee, asked him to <F>err</F> <F>err</F> take <SC>my back</SC> <F>um</F> my brief case back to me. And the <.></.> <F>err</F> <.></.> <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he jumped to the railway and then he <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> took my briefcase back to me.<..></..> <F>Uum</F> <SC>I have</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>I</R> <F>er</F> <R>I don't have</R> <.></.> <F>uum</F> <SC>I don't have <F>err</F> very much</SC> I don't have <F>ur</F> a <R>lot</R> lot of things to tell about <R>the</R> the attendant because <F>uum</F> <.></.> I have never talked to them <F>er</F> in a station.Before <R>I ha</R> I have no experience that I talk to them or I asked them to do something. So <R>I</R> <SC>I don't know</SC> I can not say anything about them.<OL>But</OL> <F>ur</F> I suppose <SC>but the</SC> they are not very kind.<F>Er</F> <SC>I</SC> when I was lost? Maybe <SC>I am</SC> I didn't ask the <SC>people</SC> <F>er</F> attendants, but I asked just the general people who are standing next to me, <CO>or</CO>. So I didn't ask or just <F>ur</F> look <R>for</R> for something by myself.<OL>Yes</OL>. I have to work.<F>Er</F> I don't have any <F>ur</F> special time. But <F>ur</F> as soon as I finish the school, I have to go to office.Very late. Yes.<OL>O K, thank you very much</OL>.O K. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
