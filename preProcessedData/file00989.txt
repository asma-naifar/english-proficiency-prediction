<F>Ah</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.<laughter>Fine</laughter>, thank you. Yourself?Everyday. <R>I'm</R> I'm a part of marketing. And <F>er</F> I'm in charge of <F>er</F> skin care and deodorant. And we have <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and <F>er</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>,here in Japan for that category.Yes. <F>Er</F>. Skin care is <F>er</F> moisturizers, lotion, milky lotion <R>and</R> <.></.> and also cleansing. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is known as a cleansing <F>er</F> product.But now, we are <F>er</F> looking <SC>at</SC> to expand <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> into skin care much more than before.I live in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. It's <F>er</F> edge of <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. It's quite close to <F>er</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>. The nearest station is <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>. Do you know?<R>You</R> you can see a big white statue.It's called <JP>kannonsama</JP>.<F>Er</F>. <R>I'm</R> I'm married.And have two kids.<R>Bo</R> both are daughters.<R>Eight</R> eight years and five years old.My daughter? My elder daughter is quite energetic. And <F>er</F> she wants everything. For example, <R>when, you know</R> <F>er</F> when, you know, my wife and me, you know, talking about things like <F>er</F> "Would you like to go to <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a kind of <SC><JP>juku</JP></SC> the <R>second</R> secondary school something like that?". <SC>And</SC> or "<SC>Would you like</SC> <SC>wh</SC> are you interested in Ballet or something like that?". <SC>They</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>he</R> <SC>he</SC> she accepts <R>every</R> everything. And <F>er</F> she is quite <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> intelligent, I think. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>From my point of view. I don't know.Yeah. But <F>er</F> the second daughter, she is quite quiet. <SC>It</SC> she is very different from the <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>. <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> is the older daughter. And the <H pn="others7">XXX09</H> is the second one.Yeah. But <F>er</F> <R>she</R> she is much more feminine.And she takes care of family quite well. Although she is quite <laughter>young</laughter>.I'm one of those. And <F>er</F> yeah, <SC>she</SC> I think she wishes to be <F>er</F> <.></.> I don't know, but <F>er</F> maybe doctor or something like that.Because she is interested in taking care of people.Or maybe nurse of something. I don't know.I don't know. But it's <R>all</R> all about learning. Because it's everyday. And <F>er</F> you can see the changes <R>how</R> how they, you know, progress. And <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I don't know. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I haven't thought about it. But anyway, <R>i</R> it's very interesting. And <F>er</F> enjoyable to be with the daughters and also, of course, with <laughter>my wife</laughter>. <OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>Weekends? <F>Er</F> we quite often go outside. Because <F>er</F> I have been <F>er</F> a part of a boy scout for quite a <F>well</F> long years. <F>Er</F>. About more than <R>twen</R> twenty years.Yeah. In the end, I became <R>a</R> a kind of master,<R>of the</R> of the team. So <SC>I am</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I like going outside. So I like camping, hiking and so on. So I take them to the sea, mountains and so on.<?>There are</?> quite a lot of <F>er</F> good place <R>to</R> you know, to be <R>in</R> in <H pn="others8">XXX10</H> <R>Pre</R> Prefecture.Yeah.I don't know. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>But <F>er</F> that's what I'm trying to do. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yep.<F>Em</F>. I think this is a junior high school <F>er</F> <R>in the</R> in the U S, I think. Because <SC>the</SC> they wear quite <F>er</F> casual <SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> wear. And the teacher is <F>er</F> teaching <F>er</F> <R>ma</R> mathematics, I think. <F>Er</F>. But <..></..> it's not a good <laughter>school</laughter>. Because the only one is just <F>er</F> listening to what this teacher is, you know, talking about. And nobody else is really interested in. And <SC>one person</SC> <SC>one guy</SC> for example, one guy is <F>er</F> doing a <SC>chewm</SC> chewing gum,while she is speaking. And <R>two</R> two girls are talking about, I don't know, maybe <SC>cosmetics pro</SC><OL>cosmetic</OL> products.<nvs>laughter</nvs> And another guy is <F>er</F> drinking <R>ju</R> juice. I don't know. Kind of <R>re</R> <R>re</R> refreshments. And <F>er</F> listening to <F>er</F> I don't know, <SC>tape recorder</SC> the music. Should be a Walkman, I think.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Junior high school days? <R>All <laughter>I</laughter></R> all I remember is <R>just</R> <F>er</F> just play with <R>my</R> my friends.Yeah. At that time, the <F>er</F> American football <F>er</F> <.></.> started becoming popularAnd we played it <F>er</F> every evening after the school.<F>Ah</F>. <R>I</R> <F>Ah</F>. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I didn't work hard. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>But <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I like the mathematics. <R>And</R> <F>er</F> yeah, and also the science and so on.Yeah.Atmosphere?<F>Erm</F>. It's very different. <F>Er</F>. Because in here, everybody is very relaxed. But in my age, I think it's <F>er</F> very common that the teacher is very strict,And they didn't <SC>allow us to</SC> <R>a</R> allow us to talk about <F>er</F> you know, <F>er</F> the things. Just we are forced to listen to what's teacher is speaking.Yeah. Very <laughter>different</laughter>.Yeah.Yeah. <R>I</R> it's O K. Because it's yellow. <nvs>laughter</nvs><CO><OL>If it's red</OL></CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><nvs>laughter</nvs><.></.> Yeah.Yeah. <F>Erm</F>. I don't know if you remember me. But <F>er</F> I bought this <F>er</F> sun grasses the other day. <F>Er</F> and <F>er</F> when tried it on, <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I thought <R>th</R> <R>th</R> <R>th</R> this is good for me. But <F>er</F> actually, it didn't fit me. So <R>could you</R> could you <F>er</F> change the sunglasses to the one that you <laughter>have</laughter>?Yeah. I understand your policy. But <F>er</F> I quite often come here and <SC>buy lot of</SC> have bought <F>er</F> quite a lot of things. And <F>er</F> you know, <F>er</F> I think <SC>I</SC> I'm a <R>qu</R> quite good <SC>customers</SC> <laughter>customer</laughter>. <laughter>And <F>er</F></laughter> yeah, <F>erm</F> <R>would you</R> <SC>would you</SC> <R>o</R> or maybe <F>er</F> I can pay extra money <R>to</R> <R>to</R> <.></.> to buy one.<OL><R>Ano</R></OL> another one. Maybe.<OL><F>Hm-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Hm-hmm</F>.<R>You</R> you can't decide?<OL><R>Wa</R> <R>wa</R> <R>wa</R> what's your problem</OL>? Right. O K. <laughter><R>You</R></laughter> you are hired.Right. <F>Er</F>.

The grasses should fit my face <F>er</F> <R>in terms of</R> in terms of the size. And also <R>the</R> the color is quite important.<F>Er</F>. And also the <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <..></..> maybe, <.></.> U V ray cut, <R>the</R> that is important,<F>er</F> for my health. <nvs>laughter</nvs>And also the shape.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<.></.> Contact lenses?<OL><R>A</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I don't like</R></OL> I don't like to put something <R>onto my</R> onto my eyes.<R>I</R> I don't like <?>to</?> do something, you know, direct.<OL><SC>Because it's</SC></OL> <F>ah</F> I don't know. I have never tried <F>er</F> contact lenses. But maybe in the future, I don't know. But <OL><F>er</F></OL><F>er</F> 'cause <R>I</R> I have very <SC>good</SC> <F>er</F> bad condition <R>on</R> on my <F>er</F> left eye,<F>er</F> I can't see, you know. So maybe <nvs>laughter</nvs> I should try just one lens for this one.I don't know.But <F>er</F> to me, it's convenient, quite.<OL>Convenient</OL>. <SC>I</SC> <F>ah</F> yeah, because I'm used to <SC>you know</SC> wearing grasses.<laughter>Thank you</laughter>.Yeah.Yes.<CO>One day last</CO>. <R>So</R> sorry. Is this <SC>part</SC> person myself?<OL><CO>Or</CO></OL>.O K.<nvs>cough</nvs> Right. <F>Ah</F>. <.></.> One day last week, <R>I</R> <F>er</F> <..></..> I went to the station <F>er</F> as usual to commute to go to the office. And <F>er</F> at the station, <R>as</R> <F>ah</F> <F>uh</F> as usual <R>there</R> there are many people on the platform. And two <F>er</F> businesspersons <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> you know, are talking about something. <SC>But</SC> and one guy <F>er</F> hit my <R>e</R> elbow. And I dropped my <F>er</F> <R>attache ca</R> attache case or business case.<..></..> And <F>er</F> <..></..> this guy <.></.> <F>er</F> didn't apologize <F>er</F> me. <.></.> Then <..></..> a train gets into the station. Then I was surprised that <SC>my suitcase was</SC> <F>er</F> I don't know, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> a train <SC>i</SC> was running over my suitcase. <R>Ha</R> however, <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> <R>I</R> I was lucky that <SC>suitcase</SC> <F>ah</F> sorry, <SC>business ca</SC> attache case was safe. Because that was not on the rail.And <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> I don't know, another guy was picking that case <SC>to me</SC> for me after that. <CO>And</CO>.<SC>I</SC> <SC>angry</SC> <OL>really angry</OL>?<nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Er</F></OL>. Angry <JP>nee</JP>. <..></..> Yeah. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <SC>Angry</SC>. O K. <F>Er</F>. <R>I</R> it's about business. And <F>er</F> <.></.> once a month, we have a regular meeting to talk about <F>er</F> network of the project. The network means <F>er</F> you know, <F>er</F> I'm in charge of marketing. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> one role is <R>to</R> to deliver innovation. To <R>del</R> deliver innovation, we need to keep track of the actions. <F>Er</F>. We ask, you know, development team to deliver <SC>the products</SC> the good products.<nvs>sniff</nvs> And also <F>erm</F> <nvs>snap</nvs> for the supply chain people, <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F> supply chain is <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> something about the logistics and manufacturing and so on. And marketing chair <R>thi</R> this meeting. And one time <R>in</R> in last autumn, <F>er</F> <.></.> the one guy in the supplies chain who was responsible for a third party <F>er</F> management, <F>er</F> <.></.> he didn't take <F>er</F> proper action. <F>Er</F>. What I mean is to control if the third party is <F>er</F> doing <F>er</F> <F>er</F> proper job <?>there</?>. <SC>The project</SC> <F>er</F> actually, the project itself was <F>er</F> doing quite well. But <F>er</F> <R>on</R> on that part, <F>er</F> <.></.> if the action was not taken properly, <F>er</F> <R>we couldn't</R> we couldn't meet <R>the</R> the deadline. At that time, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <F>mmm</F> I <F>er</F> <?><JP>ma</JP></?> angry about this person who are in the supply chain.<OL><F>Ah</F> everything was fine</OL>.Yeah.But the reason why I was angry was that the <.></.> action is <F>er</F> kind of <R>s</R> <F>er</F> <SC>se</SC> <R>s</R> sequence.Because <F>er</F> someone else is <F>er</F> waiting for his action. <F>Er</F>. Because what's happened was <F>er</F> we are doing trial production prior to the <R>actual</R> actual <F>er</F> final production. And for that purpose, <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the line in the factory <F>er</F> should have been fixed.But <F>er</F> at that time, another <F>er</F> manager who was in charge of process actually visited that, you know, third <SC>past</SC> party factory. And she found that <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the line was not fixed. So actually, <F>er</F> <SC>they</SC> <R>she</R> <R>she</R> <R>she</R> she couldn't make <SC>the trial</SC> <R>her</R> her job.So that sort of thing happens many <laughter>time</laughter>.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Yeah.Thank you very <OL>much</OL>.Thank you very much.
