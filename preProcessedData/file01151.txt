  the situation is the school.   in the classroom,  there are many student and one  woman teacher. I think the class is for  mathematics.    a few student, he study hard but  many student, they are not interested in  mathematics, I think.

I like Paris and Nice.   I will talk about Paris.  the Paris is the most famous city in the world and  there are most tourists in the world, I think.  the Paris is very nice because  in Paris,  there are classic and modern. .  It's very much mixed.    I like that. And   in Paris,  there are many  mode shop.  for example, Chanel and Louis Vuitton.  but      in those shop,  there are many Japanese and there are a few foreigners, I think.
.
  I prefer Paris because   I did  say before,  in Paris,    there are      classic things and modern things.
It's very much mixed. And   in Tokyo, for me, it's   too modern and   there are not so much classic things.
