   in my high school, there is no school trip.
. .
 yeah.  so in spite of that,  we went to the   club house,
that the circle activity  usually use.  and in that,   we did the  
conversation competition,
   about many topics,
 for three days. That is  in spite of the school trip.
   I heard the reason  why the school trip  was cancelled for  thirty years ago. .  The reason is that    some students  who were deep  drunk   were playing  outside.             and  climbing  the Kyoto Gosho.
.  and    many policemen  came there.
   from next year, the school trip was cancelled.
Yes.
Yes

Last week?
  one week?
.
.    .    last Sunday,   two girls  planned going camping and  prepare for going there.    and   after reaching there,  they were making  camps    tent.    and  prepare for the cooking and making the fire.   and suddenly,  it began to rain. And  two girls were surprised.  and  the   wind was blowing hard. And  prepare for the camping  was blown off. So  they were   escaping  into the car. And  the camping was cancelled. And   driving to anywhere   stayed at safe   and found a hotel. And finally,   they reached the hotel   and  enjoy themself  with  drinking coffee.
 no.
     .
  because    there maybe many things that  I  have to do for camping. So   it's disturbing .
 yesterday,    we lost our .
And  didn't have the map. So I don't know    which way,
to go there. So     we depend on the sixth sense. 
And    it took  four hours   to get there.
Yes.
.
. No.   because  there is   no light and no shops and no maps  on the street.
 it is so 
 country. So    we   no choice but to depend on my .
   because  the map is about  Tokyo area.  Iwatsuki is Saitama Prefecture, so Iwatsuki is out of the . .
   because   on the driving,    we can see many places  that I've never been.
So    if it's not car,     that is rare. But  the car driving is  more comfortable  than using   and a bicycle.
    and  I haven't   yet used to driving because    I'm a beginner for driving. . 
.
     I will  go to Shinjuku and   go to a bookstore,
   find  the book that    I'm looking for.
  an English  book     for teaching  English to  school student.
