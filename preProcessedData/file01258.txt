Maybe because I came here, too.<F>Urm</F> and the English level's high.<F>Urm</F> I think you can get all kinds of experiences from other people because there're a lot of people from other countries that come here.And you can talk to them about how their country was <OL>compared</OL> to Japan.It is.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> O K.O K.O K.

And <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>well</F> when I went there, it was winter sowe decided that we're just gonna go skiing.In summer?<F>Urm</F> any kind of sport?<F>Urm</F><F>well</F> I like any kind of sport.So <F>urm</F> if I have the opportunity to do it, I <R>tr</R> try anything.And I like swimming, too.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><F>Urr</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> I like team sports betterbecause when you win,I think I feel <SC>much more happier</SC> much happier than <F>urm</F> just the individualsport because you won all together instead of by yourself. And there're a lot of people to, you know, talk about it. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.<OL>Yeah, <SC>sha</SC> we can</OL> share the happiness. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.O K.<nvs>sniff</nvs><OL>O K</OL>. <nvs>cough</nvs>O K.O K.<OL><F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> just <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F></OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.<F>Ur</F> I'm really sorry, but my mother's really sick, I think she got the flu. And I don't think I can go to the party this time.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>No. My father's out on sabbatical and my brother is at club and I don't think he's gonna come home today.<F>Ur</F> <SC>I th</SC> he said that he was just gonna go over to spend the night at his friend's house. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<OL><F>Uh</F></OL> I don't know his friend's phone number and he doesn't have a cellular phone. So I don't see if I can reach him at all.I'm really sorry, but <F>ur</F> I really don't wanna leave my mother alone. <SC>And</SC> because she looks really sick and I know she needs the company. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<F>Um</F> I don't really know any of the neighbors and I'm not really familiar with them. And I can't trust them. SoI really don't <OL>feel comfortable <??></??></OL>.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> I really can't tell you what to tell them, but to apologize for me and to tell them that I'd really like to come <F>uh</F> if you have another party.<SC>And</SC> but I really can't make this one.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> I'm really sorry.<F>Mm</F>.O K.Yeah.<F>Urm</F> avoiding<OL>like</OL> breaking <OL>a promise</OL>?<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I try not to <F>er</F> break a promise at all. And <F>ur</F> <SC>if I have to, I think it's just really</SC> <F>uh</F> if I have to break a promise, it's really a serious problem.<CO>So</CO>.Sometimes it's <F>uh</F> unavoidable, but I don't think it's good to break a promise because you'll make the other person not trust you as much as they used to. And that breaks their friendship <OL>and</OL>trustworthiness. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.When you trust somebody, you need to know the person for sure.You need to spend a lot of time with them, I think. And to trust a person, I think you should know the family, too.<OL>Not</OL> only the person, but <OL>yeah</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.One day last week, a man was driving a car to work. <SC>And</SC> but <SC>in front of him was</SC> <F>ur</F> a man coming towards him on a bike was on his cellular phone with his girlfriend. And he was talking with the girlfriend about what time does she meet tonight. <F>Urm</F> after a while, they bump into each other. And the man dropped his cellular phone and breaks it. <nvs>cough</nvs> The bike driver got really angry at the car driver and told him that he should pay for his bike and the accident was all his fault. And the car driver got really angry and they decided to call the police. <nvs>cough</nvs> And when the police came, the bike driver told the policeman that it was all the car driver's fault. But the car driver told the policeman that the bike driver was on his cellular phone and the accident was the bike driver's fault because he wasn't paying attention to the road at all, and <SC>he was</SC> all his attention was going to the phone. The police agreed to the car driver and the bike was towed away.No, I don't have a license. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.I use my cell phone <OL>a lot</OL>.<F>Mm-hm</F>. It's allowed to <OL>bring to school</OL>.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> I think you should always pay attention, <SC>instead of</SC> paying attention to what's in front of you and around you instead of to your phone.And you should never use it on the train, <OL>I don't think</OL>.There's some people that have the pace maker, and it disrupts their pulse.And it's lethal. And <F>urm</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> cellular phones are also <F>urm</F> <.></.> expensive, too.<OL><CO>Some</CO></OL>. To call, <OL>send mail</OL> andyour parents pay for it most of the time, I think. <OL>And</OL>it's a lot of trouble for them, <OL>too</OL>.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Urm</F> I sometimes go on the Internet.But <SC>after a couple of times</SC> <F>well</F> couple of times I went way over the limit that I was supposed to go.And I just decided that I wasn't gonna use it anymore.<OL>So</OL> now I don't use it that often.Yeah.<F>Mm</F>.Today?Not really. I thought I was gonna go to club, but the interview was <SC>a</SC> <F>um</F> <OL>on a awkward time</OL>.<OL>That's O K</OL>. It's not your fault.So I just decided that I wasn't gonna go to <OL>club</OL> today. <CO>So</CO>.Yeah, but <F>um</F> I'm gonna wait for my friend that's<F>um</F> taking the interview, <OL>the next room</OL>.Yeah.<R>He</R> he has an interview from like four forty, I think.<OL>I'm</OL> gonna wait for him and then go home <OL>with him</OL>.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Thank you, too.
