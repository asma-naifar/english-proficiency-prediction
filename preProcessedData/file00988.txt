As I say, <SC>so</SC> I went to the U K and visit there five months. And then <.></.> went to Thailand. And <SC>be</SC> <R>I've been</R> I've been there for seven months.<F>Oh</F>. <OL><F>Well</F></OL>.When I was in the U K, I took <SC>several time</SC> several times.But not in Thailand.<F>Well</F>. British train <nvs>laughter</nvs> is <F>er</F> <.></.> not punctual. So <F>mm</F> when I see <SC>the</SC> their brochure, <R>th</R> they are proud of the punctuality. So it says <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> I can't remember the exact number. But the eighty percent of their train <R>s</R> <F>er</F> starts within <.></.> ten minutes <.></.> <F>er</F> on the punctual time.So normally in Japan, so <F>mm</F> it should <?>be this</?> punctual. But the <R>ei</R> eighty percent isn't so high. And also they says that within the <F>er</F> ten minutes or <F>er</F> something. So I can't <R>beli</R> believe it <SC?>then</SC?> <F>mm</F> when I <F>uh</F> first <SC>see</SC> saw it.Delay train? <F>Oh</F> yes, I did. And sometime it easily cancels. I say easily cancelled the trains <F>er</F> are the big problem with it. When <SC>I</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>so</SC> I was in Sheffield, it was two hours <R>from</R> <F>er</F> from London. <F>Erm</F>. <F>Uh</F> and normally, <R>I</R> I take a reserved seat. But the train was cancelled. <R>And</R> and no information about it. <R>I</R> <SC>I can</SC> I just can't see my train. And I <F>em</F> look around and <F>mm</F> catch <F>er</F> station worker. And I asked, "Where is my train?". "No, just cancelled.". "So what should I do?".<F>Mm</F>. <F>Mm</F>. "<R>J</R> just ask the at the office or <laughter>something</laughter>.". And I went there. <SC>And</SC> so "No, sorry. Just <laughter>cancelled</laughter>.". So <R>I</R> I look for the next train. But the next problem is there is the information of the next train. But before that, <SC>there is</SC> <F>er</F> how can I say, <F>er</F> it's not a normal train. But they <.></.> use <F>er</F> additional train for, I am not sure, so it's <F>er</F> extra for the cancel train or not. But there <R>w</R> was another one.But no information <.></.> again.So I missed it. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I had an, yeah, <.></.> appointment with friends <F>er</F> at that time. But I <.></.> can't,join it. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>.<F>Hm-hmm</F>.<F>Hm-hmm</F>.<.></.> <OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.O K. <F>Hm</F>.Just short story,<OL>is</OL> O K?<F>Erm</F>.

And then just after buying it, <R>she found</R> she found a <SC>s</SC> discount sale. So it's <F>mm</F> looks like a just a <?>seasonal</?> sale. And she bought <.></.> <F>mm</F> <.></.> <R>sh</R> <SC>she may</SC> she might bought <F>er</F> a shoes and clothes. And <?>then</?> after all, she bought a lot for herself. <.></.> <OL>That's all</OL>.<F>Well</F>. Not really.<F>Oh</F>. <F>Well</F>. Actually, <SC>if I say just buying <F>er</F> foods</SC> so if I say <R>j</R> just like <SC>a</SC> <F>mm</F> just food, drinks <SC>I wen</SC> <F>er</F> I go shopping quite often. But if I saying like <F>er</F> <F>uu</F> buying tie or to department <R>sto</R> store, I don't go so often.Because I don't need it.<OL><??></??></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm-hmm</F>.After this? I have another meeting.<CO><OL>So</OL> <F>mmm</F> I wen</CO>. <OL><F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F></OL>.Yes. And I have to go up to <SC>the</SC> my desk.
