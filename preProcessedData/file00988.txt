. My name is .
.
Yes. Nice to meet you, too.
.   so-so. It's O K. Actually, I've caught a cold last week.   but now  becomes better.
.  .    in  but   Prefecture.
 neighborhood? .  so nearest station, it's called . So  as you can  see since there are a lot of temples are around there.
. What else? And it's a bit far from center of the city. So there are   not   office place. And there are lot of   living  houses there. Not so    crowded and 
 not so noise. It's good place to live.
. .  two year and a half.
. .  A few kilometers 
from there. So   I lived in an  Prefecture.
But just after getting married, I moved to that place.
 so, when I join the company, I moved to  Prefecture.
And then after got married, I moved to .
Wife?
Small. 
.  So she is two years younger than me. .  Of course, she is a woman.  And she has a part-time job at this moment. And also she goes to school   after finishing  her job,
every day.
. I'm not  so sure. But I   she is  learning an architecture,
at this moment. But it's a  very basic  architect. So  she is learning something like  mathematics and   yeah,     physics. And some  computer techniques,
for making  drawings.
I don't know. 
. Actually,    she is quite keen to learn something.   and   for long time,  she is interested in the something like a designing.
So she learned  computer graphics      she   some homepages and the computer as . And        I can't say even in .     she learns some techniques for drawing,

of its pen. And now she moved on to the CAT system.  it's kind of  how can I say, architectural graphic design system on computer.
.
.
. . O K. Here is a  restaurant, looks like a French restaurant. And  it's seven o'clock.  a  few couples are  in this restaurant. And there is a piano and a woman  is playing the piano. . In front, I can see a couple,  looks like a   early twenty years gentleman and a lady. I'm not sure they get married, looks like a just a couple. And they are drinking a red wine. Looks like a tasting. And,
    so why I say that it looks like a tasting, the waiter is   showing the label wine. So I thought   he is tasting. And  I can't see any dish on the tables. So it's just a beginning of the dinner, looks like dinner. .  That's it. 
Celebrate ?
. Wedding  anniversary. Very difficult .
Yeah. It   so we can't say it's the weekend or not. So  basically, we celebrate our wedding    wedding day on weekend.
But  the exact day just  ourselves in with wine at home.
.  And on weekend, so we went to eat out to celebrate  party    celebrating day.  .  .      we don't give anything each other. Normally, just  .
.
.
.
. Can I have  some question?
So it says you are    station man.
?
 Worker.
And. . So, it's in the U S, you mean. . 
. O K. Anyway. Yeah. I'm ready.
. .   I wanna go to the  New York   soon. Are there any direct train to the New York?
O K. So I want to bit  go there as soon as possible. So can you give me a  earliest train ticket?
.
.  I don't matter about the cost. So the express or bullet train is better for me.
So the earliest timing is the  priority,
for me.
Yes.
 my dear.     so next earliest one?
Yes.
. So how much is it?
.  fifty dollars? Can I use a credit card? 
O K. Let me see.  O K. Fifty dollars.
. So,  let me confirm the    are there any reserved seat or non-reserved seat?
Free seat. So can I change it to the reserve seat with non-smoking?

. .
. Five dollars.
O K. Yeah. Thank you very much.
.
. I see. So  which platform   I should go?
.
Five. So     when just go up, I can see the plat  number five?
O K. .
On right side? .
Thank you very much.
You, too. .    no. 
Have a nice day. 
 Yes. . As I say,  I went to the U K and visit there five months. And then  went to Thailand. And   I've been there for seven months.
. .
When I was in the U K, I took  several times.
But not in Thailand.
. British train  is   not punctual. So  when I see  their brochure,  they are proud of the punctuality. So it says   I can't remember the exact number. But the eighty percent of their train   starts within  ten minutes   on the punctual time.
So normally in Japan, so  it should  punctual. But the  eighty percent isn't so high. And also they says that within the  ten minutes or  something. So I can't  believe it   when I  first  saw it.
Delay train?  yes, I did. And sometime it easily cancels. I say easily cancelled the trains  are the big problem with it. When    I was in Sheffield, it was two hours   from London. .  and normally,  I take a reserved seat. But the train was cancelled.  and no information about it.   I just can't see my train. And I  look around and  catch  station worker. And I asked, "Where is my train?". "No, just cancelled.". "So what should I do?".
. . " just ask the at the office or .". And I went there.  so "No, sorry. Just .". So  I look for the next train. But the next problem is there is the information of the next train. But before that,   how can I say,  it's not a normal train. But they  use  additional train for, I am not sure, so it's  extra for the cancel train or not. But there  was another one.
But no information  again.
So I missed it.  And I had an, yeah,  appointment with friends  at that time. But I  can't,
join it. 
.
.
.
 .
O K. .
Just short story,
 O K?
. A woman  went to the department store to buy her husband's  present for his birthday. And she bought a tie.  And ask the  clerk to wrapped and beautifully wrapped. And then just after buying it,  she found a  discount sale. So it's  looks like a just a  sale. And she bought      she might bought  a shoes and clothes. And  after all, she bought a lot for herself.  .
. Not really.
. . Actually,  so if I say  just like   just food, drinks   I go shopping quite often. But if I saying like   buying tie or to department  store, I don't go so often.
Because I don't need it.
. 
.
.
After this? I have another meeting.
. .
Yes. And I have to go up to  my desk. And then,  wait for the  phone call from the agency people. And then I bring my colleague,
to meet them.
Yeah. Actually,  I don't take lunch today.
. 
Please  transfer my message to the personnel. 
Yeah. .
Yeah. Thank you.
