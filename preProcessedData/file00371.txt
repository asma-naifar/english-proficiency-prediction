Nice to meet you, too.
  I feel a little bad because it's time   for me to,   allergy time.
Cedar pollens  allergy.
. So, it's  I'm not so well today.
. I took  the medicine for my allergy.
So I'm a little sleepy  I'm a little down.
I live in  City.
Did you know the  City?
It takes about forty minutes from here  to the south part of  . It's  a little  rural area. .   but it's very  comfortable to live. There are so many greeneries. And the air is much  cleaner than    main of the Tokyo.
Pardon?
Yes,  I live   with my family. .
. My husband and my daughter.   I have a son, but he lives  in  Prefecture in   his   company's dormitory.
  I don't know,  but  I'm not sure, but he is   sales department, I think. .
   he doesn't sell, actually,  he plans some  customers.  to give us a plans  to the customers. And   to how to live,      to, but    he   sells the land.
I think. Sometimes he sells the   apartment house or  factories or something like that. . It's very .
Yes.
. Mostly, I like to read. And sometimes I go to swimming and sometimes  traveling. .  And I like to read  history books. . . And sometimes I go to   art exhibition,  to see the  really nice   masterpieces.
 I went to    collection. . It's very nice,   very attractive. .
. . Yes.   I was very   impressed. . Very little girl sitting on the chair, smiling.  she's very cute. But    I accept  she's a  very selfish girl.     I feel she's a kind of selfish or childish.  of course, she is childish, but  she looks so        selfish. . But she's very cute. .
 First,   I watched  that   picture,     and   her face is very   bright, and she looks very   happy girl. But her smile is something     yes,  I think she's a selfish .
. Her smile is   , or it just like  selfish. .
.  This is a very nice restaurant or     French restaurant, I think. And    probably,    ,      two people   sitting by the table. I suppose  this two people  looks    spouse. And  she celebrate something, probably,    ceremony birthday or   celebrate birthday, probably. And  they  drink wine. .  And tasting, probably,   one  husband    tasting wine, and  he choose a good wine for the dinner. .
.
 . Not so flashy.  But  a kind of formally.   I want to wear  formal wear or    putting some very nice  accessories.
 My favorite accessory is pearl. . I like pearl very much.   it fits every kind of  clothes. . So   I like pearl. . And I have   earring,  necklace, bracelet and all kinds of accessory with pearl.
Are you ready? O K.
Yes.  I would like some shoes. .   Brown and   not so flashy, and size  twenty three.
Could you  give me some kind of shoes?
?
.  it's so-so, but     do you have   another one or,
brown color.
 Is this a size twenty  three?
O K. I'll  try.
Yes. . .
. Yes. O K.   I'll take these. 
 . Cash, please.
Yes.
Thank you.
  And 
?
  I don't like to use credit card, because there are some trouble happening,  I've heard.
. If I have a  card,      some person    rob or     to use in wrong way.  and  we have to  pay  for them. So I don't use  so many times  credit card.
  if  I have to,  expensive  things, I use   credit card because I have to bring ,  much money  in my bag.
So   I use  credit card.
 Do I explain first and second,  ?
 .   from this picture.
.  .    when I was walking in the rainy day  with my friend, I found a cat in a very dirty box.  And  I looked in,  I found a very  small poor  cat in the box.   but it's very cute, and I wanted     to keep in my house. But my mother's  always said that   you don't have to keep a cat in  house. So I asked  my friend,  "Do you keep this?". But  he said "No.". He refused.   but  it's  looked very poor. So       I tried to ask  mother to keep this  in my house. And      I brought them, but  I brought it to my house with my  friend in     very hard-raining  day.
 when I was young,  I had a argument. But recently,  I don't want to fight  others. I can  manage   how to avoid  that kind of things. But sometimes I had a argument with my husband. 
Worst one? Yes. .    he always ask to do something,  to bring me a cup of tea, or    to take care of the   his  daily,  daily works or something. But  I don't like that. . He should do himself, I think.
. .
Yes. It's surely beautiful day, but  there is a   very big amount of cedar pollen in the air. So I have to put masks,   special glasses, you see.
And   have a hat.
So I have to  quickly come  to avoid the pollen.
. It's very hard time   for my allergy.
Yes.   in this time, I usually go to swimming pool.
It's really good for my health.
Thank you .
