. from this picture.
. . when I was walking in the rainy day with my friend, I found a cat in a very dirty box. I looked in, small poor cat in the box. to keep in my house. But my mother's always said that you don't have to keep a cat in house. So I asked my friend, "Do you keep this?". But he said "No.". He refused. it's looked very poor. So I tried to ask mother to keep this in my house. And I brought them, but I brought it to my house with my friend in day.
 when I was young, argued I don't want to fight others. I can manage how to avoid that kind of things. But sometimes I had a argument with my husband. 
Worst one? Yes. . to bring me a cup of tea, or to take care of the daily, daily works or something. But I don't like that. . He should do himself, I think.

It's really good for my health.
Thank you .
