My name is . Call me .
Yes.
I'm fine. Bit nervous.

No. Not yet. I'm starving.
Yes.
 actually, I usually don't eat breakfast. Because I always wake up very late  in mornings, so  I have brunch.  usually  I have brunch around, let's see, one or two o'clock in the . A really big meal. Because I don't have  work during the daytime usually.   I always cook almost the same thing. Toast, egg and salad and some yogurt. Well-balanced food, I think.
Yes.
Very unhealthy,  I would say.  because  usually I leave home around five or six P. M. when people usually come back home. So  I realize that  whenever I go to work in the evening,   the speed of people walking is rather slow  in the morning.
That was very interesting. And  then in the evening   after my job is done,  most people got drunk.  I don't feel very happy about that. Otherwise,  pay is good. So I can't complain.
Yeah.
  I have Saturday work which starts from eleven-thirty until nine P M, almost non-stop. That's one of my major day. So  I work all day on Saturday. But usually I keep my Sundays open.
Yeah.
  I was doing work. 
.
When it's really sunny day, I would like to do a lots of laundries.  and I clean up the room. Basically,  since as I said, I usually work in the evening and the Saturdays are busiest day   of the week, so I usually dead sleep on Sunday.
Yeah. Nothing special.
 I go out with my friend to drink or eat something.
Yeah.
Yep. It's not a house, it's condominium. But yes.
Yep.
 Obviously I don't have   to pay for rent. That's a good advantage. But I still like got a lots of loan.
  still I feel like I can do  
 you know, to create my room. And then  I can use     the pin on  the wall  something
without worrying about the  landlord. And also I can keep my pets. It's a good point.
.
O K.
.  this is   the picture of a restaurant.  there are three tables. And  each table's got  customers, basically couples. And  there is a  big table in the middle. And a couple is sitting. A guy with a yellow jacket is tasting the wine with a big smile. And   his   right side,  maybe  his girlfriend or wife is sitting, smiling at him, too.  yeah. The other side of   the table, a waiter is standing, holding the  very nice, thick bottle of wine, showing the   label to this guy. I think  he's going to accept to have this wine. And behind that, there is         bottles of wine, sorry. And  it's looks like  this is a very luxurious hotel because  there's a big space between tables. And  it's  seven o'clock. There's a big clock  right next to the wall. So I believe this is the  dinnertime.  next to   the clock, there's a piano. Upright, I think. Yeah. And a lady is playing the music.
.
.
 I think of the big reason is that  the people who is working at  the  center of Tokyo are working so hard during weekdays. And   they don't have enough time  to prepare  their meals by themselves. And then there are lots of  people who are living by themselves just like me. And   it's too much work to cook and do dishes. So  eating out is much easier. Or of course,  it costs a lot. But  still, you can enjoy the meal talking with friends  and the co-workers. That's why I think it's popular.

.
 gee. I don't know.       I usually don't eat out. As I said, I usually  cook at home simply because  it's more economical.  but  when I eat out, I usually go out to , Japanese-style bar with my friends. Yeah.  I like , a Japanese-style bar much better than  Western-style bar. Because Western-style bar,   they usually don't serve meals.   we just keep standing and  holding the  beer bottle until it gets    room temperature.  like that. So  I like to eat and drink at the same time. Yeah.
Sure.
O K.
.
O K.
I think so. .
All right. .
Yes, please.  suppose this is a pet shop. Is that O K? O K.  yes.  I got this puppy about five days ago.   and when I  bought him, one of your sales clerk  said that  this is really friendly puppy. But actually he is notorious. He just keep barking and biting me and my cats. I have two cats.
And  you know, they don't just  get along with each other very . So  if it's possible, I would like to return this puppy .
.  I told him. I told him.
Yes.
.
Right.
But you know,  he is biting my kitty.  You know? And   apparently, he is not very happy staying in my house. I can tell.  I used to keep dogs for  more than ten years and I do know the  dog's personality. And apparently this dog doesn't belong to my house. And   I mean this puppy's life for the rest of his life</SC> you know,  once  I got  the pet,   I would like to take care of him   for the rest of his life. But apparently he doesn't look very happy. And thinking about his happiness, you know,  I don't want to keep him.
  for my happiness and my cats' happiness and then, you know, from the  humane point of view, I don't think it's a really good idea for me to keep this pet.
.
.
How long does it take?
Week.  O K.
 It's really . It's really cruel for this little puppy. I don't like that.
Please do.   in that case, I can keep him in the  other room which I have, you know, extra room. So  I can confine him in that room for next five days if it's O K with you.
O K.
 I will wait for five days.
?
.
I'll talk to you later, then.
O K.

 O K. Yeah. I do have a   two cats, as a matter of fact. Both of them are really old. You said the personality?
Characters.   before these two kitties, I never had a cat before.   but that time was the first time when I had these kitties. I didn't think that cat had personalities. But now I have two of them. But  those two got totally different personalities. I realized that.  then if you keep the cats long enough, you can really tell what they want  from the way they meow  at me or  the way they look at me or they rub their heads,  you know.  those kind of thing you can really tell
what they want.
 really interesting.
 different from dogs.
.
O K.
.
O K.
Sure.
.
O K. Let's see.  One day last week,  my friend, Naomi and I  went camping. So  in order to do that, we had prepared lots of camping gears  including tents and foods and everything. And we packed everything, we loaded everything in the back of the seat of my car, which was yellow. And   it was Oregon State in the United States. So  we went to the   near Mount Saint Helen. Then we pitched tent. Everything went all right.  Naomi   knew exactly what she had to do to pitch a tent. I start cooking.  I think that was  curry rice.  it looked really fun. Then all of the sudden,  it started to rain. And  I was really worry because  you couldn't predict   the weather of the mountain. But Naomi said, "No, it's all right. Let's keep doing that.".  however, maybe thirty minutes later,   the wind began  to be really strong. And  tent blown away. Everything's just blown away because the  wind was so strong. So we just rush into the car.  try to wait a little bit. But    the wind and storm didn't stop. So we decided to move along. We  we started to drive. And we happened to find a nice, cozy   hotel called "Hotel Cosmos". So we decided to check in.  fortunately, the room was available. So  we stayed there. And we took a shower and have a nice cup of coffee.
Yes.
.
. I am.
I think so. . .
 no,   I have to kill few hours, actually.
 then I have another work in the evening.

.
Yes.
 do that.
Thank you very much  for everything, .
O K.
