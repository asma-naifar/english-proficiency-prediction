 I'm .
 please   call me .
Right.
Nice to meet you, too.
 yeah, very good, thank you. What about you?
 I just woke up very late, and didn't have a  breakfast. So I'm  very hungry.

   I got  two sisters. One is  elder sisters and younger sisters. And  you know just  my father and my mother.  That's it.
 my older sister is married, and  have a  daughter, and  yeah, she is  really kind to  her daughter.
?
. I'm sorry. Yes.
 because   I can't get    any present for her   because I haven't got  any job now so  I hope  I become like that.
  I play tennis. And  I like to go scuba diving.
Yeah.
 yeah. In Sydney.
 in   Watson's Bay.
Underwater?  it's really cold because it's a winter time. And  just  I couldn't see any fish and  some other kind of things so I just feel very cold.
.
. .
It's very   sunny day. And  a  family has got very  big house, and    children is just      playing with ball. And  maybe a  very typical, isn't it?
 And   I think he is a   father  of those  children, and  reading newspaper.    and the mother is just standing next to  her car, and  talking to neighbors  with a dog. And      another neighbor is just running on the road. And     they have got two dogs,         and  daughter   is doing exercise.  . Yeah.
 because my neighborhood  live in Japan,   so   they have got much smaller houses.  and    these picture, the  family has got a very large gardens, but   my neighbor   has got no gardens.    and    my neighbor actually hasn't got dogs, and  have got only one child.  Yeah. 
Yeah.  this one because       if this family became my neighborhood, I've got the house here. Maybe it's much larger than actual size. Yeah. So I hope this picture is much better.
Yeah.
Excuse me.   would you please exchange my ticket to  another  new ticket because   I'm just late for departure.
.  Yeah. O K.  because I got the  reserved seat, and  maybe     I can exchange it to the  non-reserved one much cheaper than     the one I got. So maybe    it's possible, isn't it?
 because    I woke up very late,   and yeah.
 Yeah.   yeah. But   I really have to go,   because   I got some relatives  who's in emergency. So I will be very appreciate  if you could exchange it.
.
Yeah. O K. Thanks.
Yeah. O K. That's fine.
Yeah.
. Yeah.
.
Yeah.
. Yeah, because  I've been to Taiwan before just once, and  I couldn't  speak in  Mandarin. And  because  I can speak  English a little bit.   so when I was in Taiwan, I couldn't communicate    each other very well. So   it was very frustrated. And  for example,   when I went to a restaurant,  I didn't find       sorry, anything to eat so it's really frustrating.
   I saw  someone eating food, and just pointed it out, and  " give it to me.". .
 yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually yeah.
Yeah.
O K.   last Monday,    I was on the way back home.   but     the  station was so crowded, and  I just   dropped my bag off,    because of  someone next to me.  so  I've got some quarreled, but      station staff is very kind to me, and  just  picked it up for me. And I finally and safely  take the train to back home.
  no. Because this first time for me so.
 I'm from .
Yeah.
.  not really as far as  yeah, I remember.
  's train system is much more complicated   because    is like   how to say, it's   we call it . It's like   I don't know how to explain, but  it's  much simpler. The  is  much more complicated.
 you know  just keep silent.   yeah, no choice. 
Yeah.
Yeah.
  because  I think  I'll stay in  still. And   I will meet some of my friends   who are my  colleagues before. So maybe   I'm going out for drinking or dinner or something.
  there's lots of people firstly. And  many beautiful girls.   yeah, and   everything is  I think it's  very expensive compared to . So I think   it's much easier to live in  than live in , I think.
.
.
Thank you.
