Because this first time for me so.<F>Ah</F> I'm from <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.Yeah.<F>Ahhh</F>. <R>Not really</R> not really as far as <SC>I</SC> yeah, I remember.<F>Uhh</F> <SC><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></SC> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>'s train system is much more complicated <R>be</R> <F>ur</F> because <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <R>is</R> <F>urr</F> is like <F>er</F> <F>uhm</F> how to say, it's <F>er</F> <R>we</R> we call it <JP>goban no me</JP>. It's like <F>urr</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know how to explain, but <F>er</F> it's <SC>much more <R>sim</R> simp</SC> much simpler. The <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> is <R>much</R> much more complicated.<F>Ahh</F> you know <R>just</R> just keep silent. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>I</SC> yeah, no choice. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.Yeah.<F>Ah</F> <F>well</F> because <F>er</F> I think <F>urr</F> I'll stay in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> still.

So I think <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's much easier to live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> than live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, I think.<OL>Yes, thank you</OL>.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.Thank you.
