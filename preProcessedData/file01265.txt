<F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Of course.Nice to meet you, too.I'm fine, thanks. How are you?I'm <F>er</F> from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><F>Er</F> <SC?>I</OL> lived</SC?> I live there.It's <F>er</F> just an apartment. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's tiny.But <F>er</F> <F>well</F> <R>it's</R> it's fine for now.<F>Er</F> it's O K. <SC>It's just <F>er</F> like a business</SC> my area is kind of <SC>a</SC> like a business part of a town, so it's kind of <?>gets</?> boring. But <F>er</F> if I go to the <F>er</F> other section,then there are like lots of bookstores and <F>er</F> other stores.But <F>er</F> for fun, I usually go to a some place else.<F>Urm</F> I <F>er</F> go to <F>er</F> my friend's house, I <SC>go to a</SC> <F>er</F> go to see movies, <F>er</F> play pool, like, you know, Shibuya or Shinjuku, you know, one of those places.Pretty much.<F>Um</F> <SC>she</SC> I got to know her when I was in the United States. And <F>uh</F> she came back to Japan about <F>er</F> five years ago. Then <F>er</F> we kind of <F>er</F> you know, kept in touch <R>in</R> in a E-mail and stuff like that. And <F>er</F> after I <F>er</F> came back to Japan last May, then we just started to just hang out.Yeah, <OL>I did</OL>.I <F>er</F> lived in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.<nvs>smack</nvs> <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>well</F> <.></.> there're a lot of, you know, nature, <F>er</F> all in the places, forests and <F>er</F> <F>er</F> hikingcourses. I live in a <F>ur</F> city called <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. It's <F>er</F> capital <R>o</R> of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. It's kind of a O K, <F>um</F> not too big.Actually <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, I think, is kind of <F>er</F> well-known even to Japanese people. And <F>er</F> it's kind of <F>er</F> probably like <R>half</R> half the size of <F>uh</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.I <F>er</F> started <F>er</F> teaching jobs and right now, I'm registered at a couple of different <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> agency to <F>er</F> send out lecturers.And I teach <F>er</F> Japanese and English <F>er</F> on <F>mm</F> different places.Yeah.<nvs>smack</nvs> I would say <SC>I</SC> <F>mm</F> it's kind of both <SC?>on the</SC?> you know, <R>in a</R> in a different way.<.></.> <F>Urr</F> as far as I can think of, there <.></.> isn't much except maybe when I teach English, I can be more logically explaining about it compared to Japanese, where in some occasions, <F>well</F> <F>er</F> we speak that way <laughter>because we <?>do</?></laughter> kind of a way. So <F>um</F> I guess <SC>Jap</SC> teaching Japanese is more instinctivethan English. However <F>well</F> I lived in United States about ten years, so it's almost equally <F>er</F> <F>er</F> it's instinctive.O K. <F>Well</F> this is winter. <F>Er</F> a lot of people are enjoying probably <F>er</F> winter vacation on this mountain. <F>Er</F> let's see. There's a couple people skiing and snowboarding. One guy just fell. <F>Er</F> looks like there is this like a private ski school with two students and two instructors, I guess. <F>Oh</F> by the way, this <F>er</F> woman is passing by at the fallen guy and guess taking a look. <F>Er</F> there's a ski lodge and there, two people are having cup of coffee or tea or something like that. <nvs>sniff</nvs> In far way, there's a <F>er</F> I don't know what it's called actually, <F>er</F> <SC>something</SC> <SC>the</SC> some vehicle to go through <R>a</R> a snowy weather. And there's a snowman <JP>ne</JP>. And there are four kids <F>er</F> <F>um</F> what's that, <R>snow</R> snow fighting or something. I forgot <F>er</F> what it's exactly called. And <F>er</F> on the <F>er</F> right top corner, there's a mountain. It's <F>er</F> somehow purple. It's not covered with snow. Let's see. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.<nvs>smack</nvs> <F>Um</F> yeah, probably three, four times, I guess.Yeah, I think it's very popular. <F>Er</F> but nowadays, I think, snowboarding if getting more popular.But I never tried it, so I'm not sure <R>how</R> <F>er</F> how fun it would be like.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.Best point <F>mm</F> <R>hav</R> <OL>having those activities</OL>?<F>Well</F> getting away from the city life for a while and <F>er</F> it's kind of a, you know, getting in touch with nature or something. And also it usually involves with some physical activities, so <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's good for both <F>er</F> mind and body, I guess.And enjoy the scenery, <OL>too</OL>.<F>Well</F> it can be very busy and stressful and <F>er</F> <F>well</F> if you live in a city and work there, then <F>er</F> <F>well</F> you need to take a break now and then. So that's what I meant what's <F>mm</F> to get away from city life.O K.<F>Well</F> <F>er</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. I <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> participated in the <F>er</F> travel tour you advertised but <SC>it</SC> <F>um</F> it's <F>uh</F> different than my experience or what I did was different from the way you advertised.So I like <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to get some explanation about it. And also I would like to get some compensation for the differences.<F>Well</F> for example, <F>er</F> <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F> hotel accommodations are supposed to be graded A but <F>er</F> we just ended up by in this shabby motel.No running water, shower, anything. And <F>uh</F> no service available so <F>well</F> it's seemingly it couldn't have cost <F>uh</F> more than one tenth of what you <F>er</F> charged.<F>Well</F> I did. But <F>er</F> they just insisted that <F>er</F> that's the place <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <SC>you</SC> your company has ordered. So <F>er</F> <SC>they just kee</SC> they just kept saying there was nothing they can do about it. All we can do is just <F>er</F> call the company.So <SC>I</SC> we couldn't do anything about it. <OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL><F>Well</F> maybe <SC>they <?>ac</?></SC> they just <F>er</F> gave it up or they didn't think it wasn't a big deal which <SC?>stre</SC?> is strange to me. But <F>er</F> <F>well</F> it was a big deal. So that's why I'm calling.<F>Well</F> that the one thing you can do is, I can ask for the <F>er</F> of <F>mm</F> <SC>how much it exa</SC> <SC>how much it would <F>ur</F> <SC>costly</SC> co</SC> <F>er</F> how much it'd cost to stay in that motel. Then compare to the price you charged us,then <SC>we wou</SC> I would like a difference between the two.Yes. And <F>ur</F> in that case, could I have your name and a number <F>er</F> just in case?And <F>er</F> maybe if <F>er</F> it takes <F>er</F> <R>l</R> <R>l</R> longer than I think then maybe I could <F>er</F> call back.Thank you very much.<F>Well</F> I look forward to your reply.Thank you for your time.<OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL>.<nvs>smack</nvs> Actually when I was in the United States, I didn't do much traveling. So <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> just <F>er</F> maybe three, four times. And I just did it either on my own or with some of my friends.So I didn't <F>er</F> use any travel agency for the like accommodations.<nvs>smack</nvs><F>Well</F> it was just a pure coincidence, more like. <F>Um</F> <SC>I was looking</SC> first <F>er</F> I wasn't going to go to college, I was just going to go to the a English language study center just for the summer and <F>er</F> maybe more if <F>er</F> anything happens. Then I was just looking through the <F>er</F> some guidebook for studying abroad in the United States. I was <F>um</F> thinking about going to the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> or <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>. Then I just found two places, one in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, one in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. Then <F>er</F> actually <F>uh</F> I went to <F>er</F> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> when I was in high school, <F>er</F> eleventh grade. So I just <F>er</F> thought I try <F>er</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And <F>er</F> with a little research, <R>in</R> in that kind of circumstance, I'm like <F>er</F> jump-before-I-look kinda person. So <laughter>I</laughter> just did.<OL>Yeah</OL>.O K. <F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> this boy was walking down the street with <F>er</F> his girlfriend. And <F>uh</F> <R>i</R> it was raining. <F>Um</F> they are just having fun, talking on the way back from shopping. Then <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> what they didn't realize was that <F>er</F> there was this <F>er</F> small box <F>er</F> just by where they're walking past. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Um</F>. <nvs>cough</nvs> Then the boy thought he heard something. And <F>er</F> his girlfriend was like, "<F>Oh</F> what are you doing?". And he said, "<F>Well</F> I think I heard something.". <nvs>sniff</nvs> Then they discovered that <F>er</F> the sound came from the box <F>er</F> they were just about to pass by. And <SC>they're tried</SC> <F>er</F> they decided <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to see <F>er</F> what's inside. <F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> the girl <F>urr</F> <SC>j</SC> opened the box and found a kitty inside <F>er</F> that <R>brought a</R> brought a smile to her face. And <F>uh</F> she <F>er</F> picked her up. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Um</F> <R>the kitty</R> <F>er</F> the kitty was so cute that <F>uh</F> <SC>she wanted him to</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>she wanted to</R> <F>er</F> she wanted to <SC>keep him</SC> keep her. So she ask him <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> "<SC>Can I</SC> <SC>should I</SC> <F>er</F> <R>can I</R> can I take this cat? <F>Er</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> <R>she's gonna</R> <F>um</F> she's gonna be so cute.". <F>Ugh</F>. <nvs>sniff</nvs> But <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> first the boy didn't like the idea, so he said, "No.". But <F>mm</F> the girl didn't give up. So she just kept asking, "Please, please, please can I have her? Can I have her?". So even though he didn't exactly like the idea <R>a</R> at the beginning, <nvs>sniff</nvs> <SC>sh</SC> he <F>er</F> finally <F>um</F> gave up. So he told her that "<F>Well</F> O K. <F>Er</F> you can keep the cat.". <F>Er</F> <F>well</F> that made her very happy. She <F>er</F> picked her up and <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> put her under the coat. And after that, <R>they</R> <F>er</F> they and the cat are going home very happily in the rain.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yeah, actually I do <SC>on</SC><F>mm</F> yeah, <R>after</R> after this session.I'm going to <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>.Actually, this is a <F>er</F> private lesson.So I'm going to <F>er</F> go to this guy's place in <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>. Like <F>er</F> he and his wife living in this <F>er</F> place called <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>. It's like I have no idea how much <OL><R>they</R> <F>er</F> they are</OL>.But <F>er</F> it <SC>look</SC> sure looks like quite a expensive <OL>place</OL>to live.O K.You're welcome. And I enjoyed the conversation. I hope I <OL><laughter>did <F>er</F> as <F>well</F> as I thought</laughter></OL>.
