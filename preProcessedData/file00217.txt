 or .

. O K.
In center of this restaurant, maybe I think this is restaurant. there are one man who is wearing yellow suit and blue tie and white shirt. And, he has a black hair, and his eyes are black, too. And, he's holding a wine glass. And next to him, there is one woman who is wearing, a pink dress and white pearl necklace. And, his face is oval, and, I think, maybe he is laughing. And, his hair and eyes are also black. And, they are just ordering the wine. And, there are one waiter, and he is wearing a black suit and white shirt.
Maybe he is a western. Because his hair is little bit brown.
 So, and, he is holding a wine bottle, and he's explaining about a wine.
.
 yes, I'd like to. But I don't have enough money to have a dinner
in such a gorgeous restaurant.
 the most big difference is, I think, the atmosphere.
 because the shop I usually go to
 Shinjuku,
is very loudly and very crowded. But this restaurant keeps very good mood. And there are few people. And if I talk to my friend doesn't hear our conversation in this restaurant, maybe.
