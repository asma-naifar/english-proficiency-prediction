. I see.
.
Yes.
Nice to meet you, too.
 not bad, but a little bit tired. many meetings with colleagues.
.
O K.
Sorry? .
 I'm living in Kumagaya town. You know the Kumagaya city?
 sure. It's , sorry, north part of the Saitama prefecture. It's close to the Gunma prefecture.
It will take about one hour and forty-five minutes from Kumagaya to my office in Shinokubo.
 it's 
from center of Tokyo.
. it's interesting because I have a long time in the train,
 I used to read the book. And, now I'm focus on reading the rule book of the football game because I'm now trying to have a examination of referee of the football game. 
I'm now focus on reading of the rule book of the football. And, I'm interested in reading any kind of books, particularly thriller or the non-fictions, something .
Because I was football player in a student age. And also, my son, he is ten years old, he just start playing the football game so I used to go to the practice, and football match every Sunday.
, every Sunday, and I brought to the practice and match with my son. So he need to spent of time as much as possible with the coach of the club team.
But ten years , he's now in elementary school, he, how can I say, so wild. And he does not hear anything about what coach say. So I take a part of the job or the task of the coach if I get the liscence of the referee 
soccer games. I will play the referee of the soccer game. during that time, the coach will look after the all of the kids. How to . 
I decided.
.
.
. I'm now in the food marketing department, and look after the brand of the . is you maybe know the black tea brand. And I have responsibility of the figures of the sales and the value share of the brand here in Japanese market.
 retail marketing .
.
. it's tough, you know, but it's also challenging
because the company of the is purly marketing company.
So the company does not sell the commodity, but sell the brand. So now the brand is much smaller than the , 
is the biggest brand 
in Japan not only Japan, but all over the world. 
go to the United States or European countries, you'll see the brand there. But is little small
here in Japanese market. so my task is growing further, and not compete with growing further to establish the business foundation to compete with other brand here in Japan.
.
O K.
. That is the scene of the class in, seems to me the But, some guys don't like the mathematics, but seems to be nice. I remember the situation in the same age.
But, what can I say, it looks be free as compared to the Japanese class. Japanese class may be more polite. Like student may be polite much more than the picture's. The picture's have a situation similar to the European or the United States student the class. Looks free. That is nice.
.
No.
, no,
. Never,
.
 but we can have chance to see the situation or the feeling of the class in the United States or European countries through the T V films or the movies.
 I really want to go abroad to study the languages or to study something because they're so free. But it's so indivisual
as compared to the Japanese ones.
Because it's free and indivisual. what can I say, they have to learn about what they want.
But, in Japanese class, they does not want to do so. If they are automatically go to the school and sit here and here. it's rule or the routine.
And I do not want to do so when my kids, my boy and my daughter go to the school.
I want them to go to the school spontaneously,
by myself, , to play 
to play something. So this is my personal feeling. The class or the system of the study in the United States or the European countries are much more improve as compared to the Japaneses class. .
Role play?
.
.
I see.
O K.
Yes, yes. I want to buy and hard suitable both business and causual.
 for the business I'm looking for the such nice briefcase to be suitable both situation 
casual and business.
The color is also depending on your recommendations. So I'm now looking for such nice briefcase.
. cost must be about less than ten thousand yens.
.
.
. Three ones. O K. What is the difference among three?
.
.
 .
. O K. looks good, but if I want to use the bags or briefcases for both business and casual, papers or the or my P C may be half a size of the A four. A four means, I don't know, Japanese , but my note P C for the papers will have to put into the bag
safely. So, if I want to put the P C into the bags, those three are the suitable for?
.
.

.
Fifty thousand.

Shock-proof.

O K. that's reasonable. So, if I want to put the P C into the bag, that is very nice
 recommend you.

Because that is a rule .
 the computer can use both in a office and 
outside. we can communicate each other by the E-mail system or the local LAN network, both. So I can go out from the office. I can communicate by standard.
Yeah.
.
.
.

.

.
 .
.
.
.
.
.
What happened here?
. . .
. I see. So the time is eight o'clock, so he's going to the office by train.
 that time, very crowd on, track he touched other mans and dropped the briefcase onto the rail. That happens. But it's very dangerous to pick up the briefcase by himself. Or the . And he will look for the station staff and ask to bring back the briefcase. .
.
.
.
.
How?
.
.
 on a train?
On a train.
. I think it's not so crowd peple on platform even on the train newspapers or something like that. But it should be care about the people around myself. I will ask to if the people still calling the cell phone ask to please stop using otherwise the someone reading the papers and the I may ask him or the her to stop reading because the train or the platform is very busy. That kind of things?
Is it right? 
 ?
.
All right. .
,

Yes, as I told you, my town 
a quiet countryside.
 there is a lot of space to play the soccer or the football, 
. .
 play football in a weekend is just a stress buster for me.
 talking with wife and the kids are also the stress buster. .
Of course, .
