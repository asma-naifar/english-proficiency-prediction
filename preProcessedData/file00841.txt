You know the Kumagaya city?<OL><CO>It's north</CO></OL>. Yes, <R>s</R> sure. It's <F>err</F> <SC>live in north side of the Kumagaya</SC>, <F>err</F> sorry, <SC>north side</SC> <R>north</R> north part of the Saitama prefecture. It's close to the Gunma prefecture.It will take about <SC>one and forty-five</SC> <R>one</R> one hour and forty-five minutes from Kumagaya <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to my office in <F>er</F> Shinokubo.<R>It's quite</R> it's <R>quite far</R> <OL>quite far</OL>from <?>cities of</?> center of Tokyo.<R>Hah</R>. <F>Oh</F> <R>it's interesting</R> it's interesting because <SC>we</SC> I have a long time <SC>during the transportation</SC> <SC>during in the ta</SC> <SC>in</SC> <SC>during</SC> in the train,<OL>so</OL> <SC>I used to yu</SC> I used to read the book. And, <SC>also I used</SC> <R>now</R> now <R>I</R> <R>I'm</R> I'm <R>focus</R> focus on reading the rule book of the <SC>soccer</SC> football game because I'm now <R>trying to</R> trying to have a examination <SC>of the</SC> of <F>err</F> referee of the football game. <OL>So, now</OL>I'm now focus on reading of the rule book of the football. And, <R>I'm</R> I'm interested in reading any kind of books, particularly <SC>in</SC> <F>er</F> thriller or the non-fictions, something <?>like that</?>.Because <F>therr</F> I was <F>err</F> football player in a student age. And also, <SC>the</SC> my son, he is ten years old, he just start playing the <SC>soccer</SC> football game so I used to go to the practice, and football match every Sunday.<OL>So</OL>, every Sunday, and <R>I</R> <SC>I carry wi</SC> <F>err</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I brought to</R> I brought to the <F>err</F> practice and match with my son. So <SC>I need</SC> he need to <SC>spare</SC> <F>er</F> spent of time as much as possible with the coach of the club team.But <F>err</F> ten years <?>boy</?>, he's now in elementary school, he, <SC>has so</SC> how can I say, <?>takes</?> so wild. And <SC>does not</SC> <F>er</F> <R>he</R> he does not hear <SC>the anything from the</SC> anything about what coach say. So I take a part of the job or the task of the coach if I get the liscence of the referee <OL>of</OL>soccer games. <SC>I will go</SC> <R>I will</R> I will play the referee of the soccer game. <F>Err</F> during that time, the coach will look after the all of the kids. How to <?>order</?>. <CO><?>How</?></CO>. <OL>So</OL>I decided.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><F>Um</F></OL>.<F>Oh</F>. <nvs>cough</nvs> I'm now in the <SC>food marketing team</SC> food marketing department, and <R>look after</R> look after the brand of the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <CO><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is</CO>. <F>Err</F> you maybe know the <R>black tea brand</R> black tea brand. And <SC>look</SC> I have responsibility of the figures of the sales and the value share of the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> brand here in Japanese market.<OL>In</OL> retail marketing <??></??>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Oh</F>. <R>It's</R> <R>it's tough</R> it's tough, you know, but <F>er</F> it's also challengingbecause <R>the</R> the company of the <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H> is <SC>marketing company</SC> <SC?>mpu</SC?> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> purly marketing company.So the company does not sell the commodity, but sell the brand. So <F>therr</F> now the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> brand is <R>much</R> much <R>smaller</R> smaller than the <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>, <OL>which</OL>is <R>number one</R> <SC>number one</SC> the biggest brand <OL><SC>here</OL>in Japan</SC> <SC>not only but</SC> not only Japan, but all over the world. <OL>If you</OL>go to the <SC>America</SC> United States or European countries, you'll see the <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> brand there. But <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is little smallhere in Japanese market. <SC>My</SC> so my task is growing further, and not compete with <laughter><H pn="others2">XXX05</H></laughter>, but <F>er</F> growing further to establish the <SC>fou</SC> business foundation to compete with other brand here in Japan.<?>Seems to be</?>.O K.<F>Oh</F>. That is the scene of the <R>class</R> <R>class in the</R> class in, <SC>the</SC> <.></.> maybe, the junior high or the high school. And <SC>the</SC> seems to me the <SC>mathematics</SC> <JP><F>so</F></JP> mathematics class. And me, too. I have the sympathy with them. I don't like the mathematics. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But, <SC>someone</SC> <SC>some guys doesn't</SC> <F>er</F> <SC?>someone</SC?> some guys don't like the mathematics, but <R>seems to be</R> seems to be nice. <SC>I recall</SC> <R>I</R> I remember the situation in the same age.But, <SC>it's very</SC> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> what can I say, <SC>the</SC> <R>it looks</R> it looks be free as compared to the Japanese class. Japanese class may be more polite. Like <F>err</F> <R>student</R> student <R>maybe</R> may be polite much more than the picture's. The picture's <R>have a</R> have a situation <R>similar to the</R> <R>similar to the</R> similar to the European or the United States student <?>toward</?> the class. Looks free. <.></.> That is nice.<OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.No.<OL>No</OL>, no,<OL>no</OL>. Never,<OL>never</OL>.<R>But</R> but <SC>we can su</SC> <R>we</R> <R>we can</R> we can have chance to see the situation or the feeling of the class in the United States or European countries through the T V films or the movies.<F>Err</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I really want to go abroad <SC>to study or</SC> to study the languages or <R>to study the</R> to study <SC?>the</SC?> <F>hum</F> something because <SC>the</SC> they're so free. But <F>err</F> <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's so indivisualas compared to the Japanese ones.Because <SC>ther</SC> it's free and indivisual. <SC>It is the</SC> what can I say, <R>they have to</R> they have to learn about what they want.But, in Japanese class, <SC>ther</SC> they does not want to do so. If they are automatically go to the school and sit here and here. <SC>The boys or the teachers</SC> <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> <F>err</F> it's <F>err</F> rule or the routine.And I do not want to do so when my kids, my boy and my daughter go to the school.I want them to go to the school spontaneously,by myself, <SC>to study <?>somewhat</?>, to play <OL><?>somewhat</?></SC></OL>to play something. So this is my personal feeling. The class or the system of the study in the United States or the European countries are <R>much more</R> <SC>much more improvement</SC> much more improve as compared to the Japaneses class. <OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>.Role play?<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.I see.O K.Yes, yes. <F>Err</F> <SC>I want to ha</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I want to buy</R> <F>err</F> I want to buy <F>err</F> <?>resystematic</?> and hard <F>err</F> <.></.> briefcase <SC>to the</SC> suitable both business and causual.<SC>I do not want to have so much <?>wear</?></SC> and I do not want to have so much <?>wear</?> for the business <??></??>. But <F>er</F> <SC>I do not</SC> <R>I'm</R> I'm looking for the such nice briefcase to be suitable both situation <OL>of</OL>casual and business.The color is also depending <SC>on the</SC> <R>on</R> <R>on your</R> on your recommendations. So I'm now looking for such nice briefcase.<F>Um</F>. <.></.> Of course, the price is also important. <F>Err</F> cost must be about <F>er</F> less than ten thousand yens.<OL><F>Hu-huh</F></OL>.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>. Three ones. O K. What is the difference <SC>of the</SC> <SC>of</SC> among three?<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<OL><F>Hu-huh</F> <F>hu-huh</F> <F>hu-huh</F> <F>hu-huh</F></OL>.<F>Hum</F>.

A four means, I don't know, Japanese <laughter>standard size</laughter>, but <SC>the</SC> my <SC>personal P C</SC> note P C for the papers will have to put into the bagsafely.
