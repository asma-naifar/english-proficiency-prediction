  . In the baby class, two or three kids     all the class is only in English   and the baby class is easy for me because I will  say from me, they just listen and copy me. But in the older students  they want to speak Japanese, so  if I ask in English, they answer in Japanese. So  if they don't know the meaning of the words, I have to  explain in English  step by step.  So if I explain in Japanese, it's very easy  but they don't remember the English words at all if I explain in Japanese, so  that's very   just the words "to listen",  if they don't understand the "listen" " what is listen, .". So I take the tambourine and
 and " can you listen or can you hear it is, can you hear?".  . " O K,  .". 
. Yeah, so.

One day last week.
One day last week,    I wanted to cook something. But in my refrigerator, there was nothing to eat.  So I went to the supermarket by car.   I drive to the supermarket and I bought   some foods to eat. I bought meat and vegetables and eggs. And   I took them from the supermarket to my home and   I cooked.  And I cooked. Is that O K?
Yes. 
 every day, I check the refrigerator what is in and  with that food, what can I make and I check the recipe. I have a lot of ,  a cooking book. So and I check the menu,  and I go to buy to the grocery store. .
 I prefer supermarket.
Because  I think it's cheaper than the department store,  I think.
  I will check if it's fresh or it's clean.  I check  that. 
.
.  I just go home.  Maybe  if I can meet with my friend, I'll have lunch with her.
No,  I'm free today.
