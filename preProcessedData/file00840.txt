Good afternoon.
 my name is .
Yes.
Nice to meet you.
 actually, not perfect today.
As I seem to have a cold, and I seem to have a fever a bit.
Yeah.
.
.
. In my case, I prefer to stay home and just keep quiet. And I'm try to have warm drinks, rather than cold drinks.
And, yeah, just take a rest. That is, yeah, what I usually do.
.
Yes. But it's O K, today is Friday.
 as I am partly a housewife, most of the weekends, I use for housekeeping things such as cleaning or washings, et cetera. And, especially in winter season, I like to go for snowboarding,
sometime.
 Yokohama city.
 not too much, I think around forty minutes .
Actually he is in the seventh floor
 in the same company.
. . . Yeah. .
How? Sorry. I .
. I see. first, one of my colleague, he was working in a marketing department. And it was, I think, five or six years ago. And he was given a snowboard as a promotional, how can I say, gimmick or promotion activity.
And, as he is not interested in that, he gave me that board to my husband. so we tried to start to use that.
 And, first one or two days, it was just sweating, 
it can't never turn rightly. But, once I find to do right way, it was complete different world from skiing.
 it's amazing, you know. still I was a beginner at that time. So the speed is not like that.
 loose not too slope is not too strong, or, how can I say, I can't explain , but the speed is not high enough. But, still as I think, probably, the stance is different from skiing to the ground or to the bottom, so I feel more wind
than skiing
 so I was so excited about that.
.
.
I see. O K. It seems this is restaurant. and there are three tables. And, in each table, there are couple of people sitting. And also, there is a piano in a restaurant as well. and a woman is, yeah, playing a piano as well. time is seven o'clock. I'm not sure it is morning or evening, but probably it should be as .
?
 I like casual ones rather than formal or dressed upped place like such as this picture.
 maybe because I'm wearing normally casual . And I think I would be more relaxed if I go to casual restaurant. .
.
.
. O K. .
 .
.
 .
 I'm looking for a new gloves.
.
 currently, I'm using gray ones. And I think gray color would be easier to fit every other colors. So, do you have any range of gray colored ?
.
 And I would prefer to have wooled one.
.
. how many price ranges do you have? .
.
.
.
 and another three types?
 one.
I see. So what was the differences among three apart from price?
.
Warmness?
How about material itself?
. How about tone of gray?
O K. two thousand yen one was little bit too light for me. So, maybe I would buy the middle one.
Is that O K?
O K.
Yeah.
Thank you.
.
.
. Shopping? Supermarkets, discount stores, 
stores.
.
 car parking.
 if we need something big one, we need car to carry that. 
we use that stores if we need something big ones.
.
.
. Yes. yeah, around thirty minutes by car.
.
.
.
. a girl with his brother were going to the station and to meet their mom. and, on a way to the station, they hear something strange sound from the box. and the girl found small cat in a box. . And, feel as she insist to bring it with her. but his brother say "No.", as just he doesn't like a cat. and also, he worries that she must not be able to take care of it by herself. however, as she is just loved to it instantly when she looked it, she finally convinced him. And they agree to just ask their mom to keep the cat.
Now? No.
. I like, yeah, I like both. Yeah.
. For me, I was having a dog almost fifteen years ago. .
It was when I was in high school student. and, as we have one dog with our family, so some of our family have to take care of him in turn. Such as, my mother take care of his foods, and my dad take care of his walk. And also, for my role was also to bring it to a walk in a late afternoon just when I was back from a school.
 as it was just the time I was really tied up with study for examination to enter the university,
that kind of the break was really helped 
to refresh my mind,
.
.
.
Thank you.
.
. I don't want to, 
 I'm afraid .
Yeah. three people are waiting for me to finish this interview
 a meeting.
.
. Thank you. .
