In my case, I prefer to stay home and just keep quiet. And I'm try to have <F>er</F> <R>warm</R> warm drinks, rather than cold drinks.And, yeah, just take a rest. That is, yeah, what I usually do.<OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But it's O K, today is Friday.<F>Errm</F> as I am partly a housewife, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>erm</F> most of the weekends, I use for housekeeping things such as cleaning or washings, et cetera. And, especially in winter season, I like to go <F>er</F> for snowboarding,sometime.<F>Err</F> Yokohama city.<F>Hum</F> not too much, I think around forty minutes <OL>by train</OL>.Actually he is in the seventh floor<OL><laughter>working</laughter></OL> in the same company.<F>Huum</F>. <F>Hum</F>. <F>Uh</F>. Yeah. <OL><F>Erm</F></OL>.How? Sorry. <CO><R>I</R> I <OL>couldn't</OL></CO>.<F>Oh</F>. I see. <F>Err</F> first, <F>erm</F> one of my colleague, <F>erm</F> he was working in a marketing department. And it was, I think, five or six years ago. And he was <F>erm</F> given a <F>erm</F> snowboard as a promotional, <F>erm</F> how can I say, <R>gimmick</R> gimmick or <R>pro</R> promotion activity.And, as he is not interested in that, he gave me that board to my husband. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> so we tried to <F>er</F> start to use that.<nvs>laughter</nvs> And, first one or two days, it was just sweating, <OL>and</OL>it can't never <F>er</F> turn rightly. But, <SC>once we fu</SC> <SC>we</SC> once I find to do right way, <F>er</F> it was complete different world from skiing.<OL><SC>That is</SC></OL> <F>erm</F> it's amazing, you know. <SC>The</SC> still <SC>it wa</SC> I was a <SC>gi</SC> beginner at that time. So the speed is not like that.<OL>The</OL> <SC>slope is very <F>erm</F> <R>loose</R> loose</SC>, I mean, <F>erm</F> <SC>it's <R>not</R> not too</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> slope <R>i</R> is <F>erm</F> not too strong, or, how can I say, <R>I</R> I can't explain <?>this enough</?>, but <F>erm</F> the speed is not high enough. But, still as I think, probably, <R>the</R> <F>err</F> the stance is different from skiing <SC>towards the</SC> <F>erm</F> <R>to the</R> <F>erm</F> to the ground or to the bottom, so <SC>I su</SC> <SC>fi</SC> I feel more windthan skiing<OL><R>so</R></OL> so I was so excited about that.<nvs>laughter</nvs>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.I see. O K. It seems this is <F>er</F> restaurant. <F>Erm</F> and there are three <SC>table</SC> tables. And, <F>err</F> in each table, there are couple of people sitting. And also, there is a piano <F>erm</F> in a restaurant as well. <SC>Pre</SC> and <SC>an</SC> <R>a</R> a woman is, <SC>playing</SC> yeah, playing a piano as well. <F>Erm</F> time is seven o'clock. I'm not sure it is morning or evening, but probably it <SC>is</SC> should be <laughter>in evening</laughter> as <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>the pi</SC> <SC>the ha</SC> <JP><F>nandakke</F></JP> the person of restaurant is showing wine to one of the customers. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>.<OL>Yes</OL>?<F>Hum</F> <.></.> me? <F>Huum</F> <R>I</R> <R>I like</R> I like casual ones rather than <F>erm</F> formal or dressed upped place like such as this picture.<F>Uhm</F> <.></.> <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> maybe because I'm wearing normally casual <laughter>wear</laughter>. And <F>err</F> I think I would be more <SC?>bit</SC?> <F>er</F> relaxed if I go to casual restaurant. <F>Hum</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<OL><F>Hu-huh</F></OL>.<F>Ah</F>. O K. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.<F>Hum</F> <JP>chotto</JP>.<OL><F>Huum</F></OL>.<F>Hum</F> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <OL><F>hum</F></OL>.<F>Err</F> I'm looking for <SC>my</SC> <F>er</F> a new gloves.<F>Hum</F>.<F>Erm</F> currently, I'm using gray ones.

So, do you have any <F>erm</F> range of gray colored <OL>ones</OL>?<nvs>laughter</nvs>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> And <F>erm</F> <.></.> also, <R>I</R> I would prefer to have <F>erm</F> wooled one.<OL>Wool</OL>.<F>Erm</F>. <..></..> <SC>Is that</SC> <R>how</R> how many price ranges do you have? <OL><CO>The</CO></OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hum</F>.<F>Hum</F> and another three types?<OL>Middle</OL> one.I see.
