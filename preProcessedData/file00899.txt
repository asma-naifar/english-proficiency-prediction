 In Kobe   by myself but actually     my company has a accommodation
 for employee.
  I live in that accommodation with   other colleagues.

. Because  I share a bathroom or  rest room

But  food is very nice and   the room is   big enough for me so.

Free time?   free time?  I like baseball and I belong to baseball club in  so  I like best doing baseball in my free time.
.
.  . It is very nice room and there is a woman   sitting in front of the computer and she's  looking at the  cat, I think cat.  cat and dogs are  very relaxing. I think it's because of   room's   atmosphere.  Maybe    she has a  good money because a lot of things are  computer, typewriter and  stereo.  So   she is a rich.
Yeah.
Sorry?
 must be.
.

is   better.
Yes. But I have a just a notebook computer.

 thank you.
Yes.
 a lot of country. 
 not so many but 
 Portugal, Spain, England,  French,
, Brazil  and .
 impressive?      Spain.
 Spain, most attractive.
?
  people are very nice and food is very nice and   I can speak  Portuguese so I can  communicate    easily compared with other peoples so  I think    they accept me  kindly so  I like very much.
  I major in Portuguese in university.
And   I was there for eight months.
So a little bit, I can speak Portuguese.
, Spanish?
    I think   they enjoy   themselves is the most different.
Because sometimes  Japanese  prefer to be alone and don't want to  play or drink with other but Spanish or   foreigners  prefer to  people and sharing  a lot of time with them. I think   that is the most  different point, I think.
 Yeah. 
.
.  The old man and the young boy are        a father and  his son. And  they were taking a walk and   they felt hungry. So        they decided to have a something and they enter the restaurant.  in a restaurant, there is a some people but  there were    some seat left for them.   so     they could have a service. And  some time after,      employee   came to them to ask a order.     they asked  order. And they decided to have a  some food and drinks  and they seemed to enjoy their foods.    and     they went to the   cash and paid a money  and    after going out of restaurant,  they said good-bye and they separated.  That's all.
 yes,     I go to a restaurant but  not good restaurant.
 .
  Japan restaurant give us a too much service. So sometimes I feel very     inconvenience or  uneasy  but  in Spain,    they don't disturb us so much. So it's easy for me   to be there  to my heart's content. 
.
Yeah. They serve us the foods   but    they mind   to disturb so much.
Yeah.
.
 this weekend?   just playing baseball. 
And if I have   my free time,  I'd like  autumn  for leaves or .
 near here. 
Thank you.
