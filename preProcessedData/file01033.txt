 one day last week,  when I was going to  cook for dinner, but there were any food in the refrigerator. So  I had to go to supermarket by car, because I have to buy much food.     I walked around  supermarket. I chose   many daily food. And   then    I went to casher.    I bought much food so I have to pay much money.  after that, I carried food to my car. It was so heavy. But    I have to put them back seat of the car and return home. Then, this time  I could cook anything.             I could cook beef stew and many things for my family.
