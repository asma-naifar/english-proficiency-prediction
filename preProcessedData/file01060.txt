Yes, like a spring. Yes.
Yes. .
. .  spring, late spring. I like May the best.
Because it's the  month  I was born and  I like the green.
. And  the  young  green leaves I like best.
   usually and my husband and  I  invite me to have  dinner,
   with my children.
 I have  three children. . All grown up.    the first is a daughter   and the second and the third     sons.
. And   my daughter and elder   son are working. And the youngest is  still studying. .
 at    graduate course     United States.

. Yes. I visited him  last  fall.
. Yes.  but  he  went to America in May. And   he was getting accustomed to the life in the U. S. when  I visited him.
.
And this    new years days, he  came back  to  have a short  vacation with us. . And  now he is again  in the America studying. But, you know,  he's getting along quite well, I think. .
.
I'm a housewife.
.    I like    painting . You know? .   have you ever heard about ?
.
 kind of drawing,  very free drawing  on  postcard or   any   paper but usually  Japanese ,  Japanese paper.
. And     we draw anything, but   very big on small paper, just as I feel. .   we use Japanese    and Japanese    color paints. . But   we draw freely, anything. Especially  we draw flowers or something like that. And we write some  not poems but the words we feel  on it, too.
Like   letters.
.
     refreshing for me. . .
Yes.
No.
Yes.
. It's a   residential area of some city. And  maybe it's the picture  on  Sunday morning. And   it's a very  fine day and     the sun is shining and  the childrens are playing near their house. And  a  man is jogging on the sidewalk. And an elderly  gentleman is  sitting on the bench reading a newspaper. And the two ladies are chatting beside  a car. And one lady has her  pet dog and even a cat is sleeping on the roof of a car. It's a very warm  day.
.
 my   neighborhood is also a residential area but not so specious like this. The house is  sticking together.   and  we don't have any grass with trees between our houses. . And in front of my house, there's a   street but  not so  wide. 
.
 I'd like to have a     shirt for my husband but      he is larger. .  . He is not so stout. He is a very lean person.
And    and  he is not so tall. And     when I buy M size, the sleeves are too long for him. And do you have any S  size  shirt   for  men,
?
Yeah. And  the   neck size is thirty-eight     maybe.
.   do you have that size?
.
Then,   show me the   ivory color  
yeah,  and M size.
  ,
S size.
.

.    let me see  for a few minutes.
. .   yes, this is very   good for him, so  I'll take this one.
.
How much is it?
. How about   this   one?
. . Not so much difference. 
But  this time, I'll buy   the cheap one.
 this one.  I'll take this one.
Yes, yes.
Yes.
.
. . Then.
.  I hope,  too.
.
No. 
  shopping. And he like to buy   his things,
himself. .
 maybe some department.       Isetan,
 department, I think. .
Because   his work place was near  and  he  used to  go there.
. But now, he doesn't  work there   but     he likes  Isetan department.
. .
.
     is this the thing  I   ?
   . Yes. Yes. Em one day last week,    two children were  walking on the   road. It was raining. And  while they were walking,    the boy heard some  sound. They wondered what was it. And the sound was  some animal's. And  they looked  around themselves and they found a box. The sound was from that box. And  when they opened it, they found a small kitten and   the girl wanted to take it home.  probably, they were   brother and sister. .   but the girl liked the cat very much and   she said she'd  like to take it home and ask their mother to keep it for  them. So at last, her brother  consented to take it home and they went home. She carrying a box   very carefully not to make the cat wet.
.    it actually happened when  my youngest  son was  ten years old.
 he found a  stray dog   when he  came back from school.
And  he    took back it home and asked me to keep it  in my house. And at first, I like  dogs but   I know  it takes   much care  to keep it  home. So   I  told him to take it to the police   station.
. And  my  son and I  went to the  police box.
And  the  policeman said,  "If you have a garden, please  keep it for a week   until they  find   the man   who lost the dog. It maybe    missing,
  dog.
. So   we  kept it   in my house but the owner didn't appear.
And  after a week,  we  went to ask  what we should do.   the police man said, "If   you can't keep the dog,     they have to  ask     I don't know the name,            to  kill the dog.  . So my   son     when he heard  that, he began to .
 . .
Yes, .
 and   two years   ago, the dog   was  died  in my house but very       I suppose    that was he,  he spent  very happily with us.
.   we were very happy with him.
. .
