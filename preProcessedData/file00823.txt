So  I asked him, "What shall we do?".  he was thinking, but I decided   to take a cat to my house.    .  he was very annoyed, but  I decided. Then   we went back home with a cat.

 .      someone    didn't want to have a cat, so   someone put the box in cat. .

  I like the cat very much. 
I already have one cat.

Yeah. And  he always  wake me up,
yeah,  every morning, early morning. 
So I have to get up early
everyday. 
.
   I   clean his toilet and    feed him and pour water in the bottle  and patting.  but maybe      he plays  with me,  maybe.
