But the weather is fine, so I guess I'll be fine, too. 
I live in .
 .
Yes.
. I have two sisters. one of them lives in .
She works there.
The other sister lives with me.
She goes to .
And .
. That's about it.
 my hobbies are basketball and soccer and I deejay at clubs in .
. To make the club happy and I just want them to have fun when they come to the clubs.
 I just like the atmosphere of the clubs.
. that's all.
Yeah. It's pretty difficult to do. But I've been deejaying for about almost three years now.
So I kind of got used to it.
 when I was around twelve or thirteen years old, I used to listen to a lot of hip-hop music.
And I like the scratching sound. And I just like the music, the entire hip-hop.
So one day, I just wanted to be a hip-hop deejay.
And that's how I got into it.
I play basketball about twice a week.
And I haven't played soccer for a long time since last summer.
But I've been playing soccer since I was five.
And I was on the basketball team when I used to live in the States, state.
So I play both sports.
 . one of them is drinking and listening to music. . The other one is playing her cellular phone. . There are two girls talking to each other. and only one of them is listening to the teacher. He's taking notes.
And there is this boy who is chewing his gum. Yeah. . It's a bad class.
 But it seems to be a nice class to me.
. Sort of. 
But I was the one taking notes. 
.
 what else? . That's about it.
. I think it's a math class though.
 let's see. gym class.
'Cause 
. And it was just a class to have fun. And the other classes were sort of just listening to the teacher.
But in gym classes, you get actually participate in the class. So that's the reason that I liked gym class.
 I didn't like math . 
I was bad at math.
