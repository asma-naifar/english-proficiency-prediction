It's pretty difficult to do. But I've been deejaying for about almost three years now.So I kind of got used to it.<F>Erm</F> when I was around twelve or thirteen years old, I used to listen to a lot of hip-hop music.And I like the scratching sound. And I just like the music, <nvs>laughter</nvs> the entire hip-hop.So one day, I just wanted to be a hip-hop deejay.And that's how I got into it.I play basketball about twice a week.And I haven't played soccer for a long time since last summer.But <F>er</F> I've been playing soccer since I was five.And <nvs>sniff</nvs> I was on the basketball team when I used to live in the States, <??></??> state.So I play both sports.<nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Um</F>. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> I think none of the students are listening to the teacher. And <.></.> one of them is drinking and listening to music. <F>Hm</F>. The other one is playing her cellular phone. <F>Uum</F>. There are two girls talking to each other. <R>And</R> <F>oh</F> and only one of them is listening to the teacher. He's taking notes.And <R>there</R> there is this boy who is chewing his gum. Yeah. <F>Err</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <?>Yes</?>. It's a bad class.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> But it seems to be a nice class to me.<F>Err</F>.
