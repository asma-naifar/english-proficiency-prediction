Since no one is around in my apartment, so <F>an</F> I can do whatever I want at any time I want. So that's one of the great advantages that I have living alone.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F>. I turn on T V, or <R>I</R> I sometimes talk to the wall.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>I am occasionally talk to</laughter> myself.And I make phone calls to my friends.<F>Um</F>.

I'm actually <F>ah</F> studying at a language school.And <F>er</F> I like to be, if possible, professinonal English-Japanese or Japanese-English translator or interpreter. So I'm not working at this moment. But <F>um</F> I'd like to focus on my studying instead of working at this moment.<F>Ahh</F>. I think <F>am</F> it's like a long history. First, I think when I was a kid like probably ten or eleven years old, I just got interested in English and thought it was kind of cool <laughter>to speak English</laughter>.<SC>And</SC> so I think that's the beginning, and then, <F>am</F> <R>I started to</R> <F>ah</F> I started to get more interested in learning English as I <F>ah</F> grew older. And, <F>er</F> in college, I started thinking about my future. And I think that's the time when I thought that <SC>I wanted</SC> I wanna be an interpreter.<OL>Thank you so much</OL>.All right. <F>Ahh</F>. I see three kids playing around house, one girl is jumping a rope, and two boys are playing with a ball. To me, it seems that they are playing volleyball. <F>Um</F>. <SC>See</SC> and one man in blue sweatshirt and pants are jogging, he also sweating. And there is a car in front of the house. And there is a <SC>cat</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>brown cat</SC> light brown cat under roof of the car. <F>Ah</F>. It's a white or silver car. And, by the car, there are two women talking or chatting. <F>Ah</F>. One of them is wearing a red shirt and a gray skirt, and the other woman is in red suits. She also <F>ah</F> has a pink shirt, and she has a dog <F>am</F> that has brown and white colors. And, across from the house, I see a man reading newspaper. He's sitting on a couch. And <SC>this</SC> there are two trees by this man. <SC>It seems like sunny day</SC> it's a sunny day.You are welcome.My hometown is in Okayama prefecture.<F>Umm</F>.

And <F>ah</F> the town is surrounded by mountains. <F>Ah</F>. But <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city is big city to me. I think it has probably four hundred thousand people living in the city. And all I see is just houses and houses and buildings. So that's the big difference, the countryside and city.<F>Ah</F>. When I enrolled college.<F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> In terms of the envirnoment, I'm not very much in favor of, especially, the air.The air. Because <F>ah</F> it seems to be polluted a little bit. The skies are usually gray. I don't see the clear blue sky many times. Whereas, back in my hometown, <F>ah</F> the water doesn't smell, and the air doesn't smell. <SC>It's just</SC> <F>ah</F> it was just <F>ah</F> fresh and nice. And I guess that's <laughter>about it</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Ah</F>. To live, <F>um-hm</F> maybe, and, for my body, too.O K.O K.Hello, <F>ah</F> hello. <F>Ah</F>.

So, <F>um</F> he wasn't paying much attention to the car that Mister Yamada was driving. And, at some point, they are almost collided. <F>Um</F>. But, slightly, Mister Yamada didn't hit the man. <F>Er</F>. He only hit the cell phone. Then, they started quarreling over the broken cell phone. This man who was riding a bike demanded that Mister Yamada should compensate with the cell phone. <F>Um</F>. A police officer came, and <..></..> <F>um</F> Mister Yamada explained what happened to the cell phone. <SC?>And</SC?> <..></..> but, as the police officer asked questions about themselves. It turned out that this bike man actually has stolen the bike, <R>so</R> <..></..> so the police officer and Mister Yamada decided to take this bike away from the bike guy. And the bike guy was left alone.<F>Um</F>. Right now, I have a visiting friend from the United States.
