How about you?<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah, <SC>I</SC> personally I prefer wintertime rather than summer.The only thing I hate is the cold and the flu.<SC>In my</SC> <SC>everyone in my office</SC> almost everyone in my office is suffering from the cold.Yeah.I hope so.<OL>I mean</OL>, I've already finished <SC>my</SC> I mean, <F>ur</F> <R>how</R> how should I say, my cold season last week.And <R>i</R> in October, I had my <F>urm</F> flu injectionto prevent the flu. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.Yes, I'm very <OL>busy now</OL>.<F>Urm</F> <R>in Sep</R> in September, <F>ur</F> I was transferred to the <SC?>new divi</SC?> <F>uh</F> new department called the English Educational Material Development Department.And now we are working on the one new project called <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> stands for <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.And it also coincide with the Japanese word, <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><F>Ur</F> yeah, it's very challenging, you know</OL>. <F>Urm</F> I would say it's always difficult to construct new curriculum or new <F>ur</F> English text books.Or new corresponded course project.But particularly it's very difficult, almost impossible <F>urm</F> <F>er</F> to design a suitable course of <F>um</F> speaking course projectfor everyone.But we have consulted many scholars like the Professor <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> from <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H>,<F>urm</F> in order to make this <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>as the new time point for, <R>I don't</R> I don't want to say declining but the <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><?>we got declining</?></laughter><?>till this day</?> <F>urm</F> to change the course of our company. <nvs>laughter</nvs><CO>So</CO>.I shouldn't use the word <OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.<F>Urm</F><?>honestly</?> when I talked to you last time two years ago, I think I said I like to play the clarinet or saxophone.But because of the having difficulty, you know, <SC>I decide</SC> I stopped playing the saxophone or clarinet.Instead, I started picking up playing the blues harmonica.Yeah.<R>About a year</R> about a year and half ago.You know <SC?>how fun</SC?> <R?>how</R?> how is the blues harmonica like?It's very small. It got only ten holes.<F>Urm</F> we use blues harmonica to play blues <OL>or jazz</OL>.And it's very cheap.<OL>And</OL> you can play it anywhere.So that's what I do for my spare time<F>er</F> to relieve myself <OL>or to <?>go</?> refresh up <?>a little</?> from</OL> life and work.<F>Ur</F> in the park.You can play it anywhere.<F>Urm</F> do you know, now I live in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, and the in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, there are many parks. <F>Urm</F> the name is, <F>ahh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>how should I ex</SC> how shoud I translate that, <F>urm</F> the <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, the park is called.And in the park, <F>urm</F> <SC>you can find</SC> I mean, you can just <SC>by</SC> <F>ur</F> become yourself in the middle of the night. And the I practice about twenty minutes to thirty minutes everyday before I go home.But on this Sunday, <F>ur</F> I'll be moving <SC>to</SC> <SC>from <H pn="others5">XXX08</H></SC> <F>uh</F> from <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> to <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>.Probably I'll go to <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> Park<OL>to practice my blues</OL> harmonicas.<OL><CO><??></??></CO></OL>. That's right.Now it takes more than ninety minutes for me to commute.But from next week, that will be less than an hour.Right. Yes.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL><F>Mhm</F> I can see some animals and people. They're both females and males. And there some buildings, trees, and a road and car. Park? No, no, no, no. The white car.Then what else? The sun and the <?>road</?>.<SC>It seems that the</SC> <SC>it's about probably</SC> this <?>scene</?> express, <F>urm</F> I would say on Sundayon weekends<OL>because</OL> you can see this gentleman. <F>Urm</F> if this happen during the weekdays, probably <F>urm</F> those two people won't be here.Because they will be go out <R>to go to</R> to go to work.I think that is <SC?>the</SC?> a scene from Sunday morning perhaps because people <F>ur</F> tend to jog in the morning,early afternoon. <F>Er</F> the <SC>sun is <SC>too</SC> prett</SC> sun is pretty high. And everyone seems to be quite relaxed.<F>Mm</F>.Yes.Yeah.Yeah. <F>Ur</F> now, I live in a apartment. And the apartment is quite small. I mean, the whole apartment. There're only about really <R>ten</R> <R>ten to</R> ten to twelve rooms in the in the whole apartment.<SC>but the new place is, <F>urm</F> I would say</SC> <F>ur</F> I think in American English, probably you don't use the term for apartment for this <SC>highs</SC> <F>urm</F> <R>skyscra</R> skyscraper-like building.But in Australia or English, probably people say <F>urm</F> <F>oh</F> city apartment, something like that.There <SC>we</SC> more than I would say, fifty or sixty rooms in the big <SC?>barg</SC?> apartment. But the I would say, <F>ur</F> the most important thing for me is the security.<H pn="others3">XXX06</H> is a very high risk area in terms of crime.But on the other hand, <SC><H pn="others7">XXX10</H></SC> compare to <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> is pretty safe, <OL>I think</OL>.<F>Urm</F> actually <SC>that f</SC> <F>ur</F> the apartment or flat my no, no, no, <??></??> how do you say the apartment, flat?What's the <R>proper</R> proper term for, in Japanese, we use <JP>manshon</JP>.But I don't know the equivalent term in American English.<F>Urm</F> that is owned by <F>um</F> somebody whom I know.Yeah, that's why I <??></??> him two hundred, pretty cheap in terms of rent.<nvs>sniff</nvs> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <nvs>sniff</nvs>Yes. <F>Urm</F> in fact, I don't want to criticize your service but the I have to say that<F>ur</F> I applied for the deluxe tour.And that says <SC>everything is include</SC> I mean every meal is included.But the surprisingly I wasn't able to have breakfast. <SC>Becau</SC> and the hotel employee said that breakfast is not included. And the I ended up paying the <R>extra</R> extra fifty or sixty dollars to the hotel.<SC>So I'd like you to explain what exactly</SC> I mean <R>I don't</R> I don't want to use the word, reimbursement,but <SC>I'd like to have some</SC> I have to have some kind of explanation from you guys.Yeah.<OL>Did you</OL>?<OL><SC>I don't have any</SC></OL> and I don't have any document.Because <SC>my fi</SC> <F>oh</F> my wife already checked away all the informationbut I <?>booked it</?>. The only thing I got is a receipt from the hotelthat says <?>five breakfast</?>.<F>Oh</F> no. But you know, a friend of mine is a lawyer.In that case, I have to report to him and <OL>probably he'll</OL> just <F>ur</F> <?>take</?> legal action towards your company.I'm really sorry for <OL>saying that <??></??></OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.Yeah.Yes. So in that case, I mean, I have to<F>er</F> ask your manager to explain all details. And the I can't remember the name of the guy <F>ur</F> <SC>who answered me</SC> who I applied for the tour.Yeah.<OL><F>Ah</F> I see</OL>. When will he be back?In three days.<OL>I see</OL>. Then in that case, I will have to come back here again.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Yeah.I see.<OL>Thanks so much</OL>. Nice talking to you anyway.<F>Ur</F> actually I mean, the things I told you is not exactly the same, but almost the sameincident that happened to me many years ago.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.<F>Urm</F> at that time, I mean, I applied for not the deluxe, but the reasonable, semi-deluxe <OL>tour</OL>,I mean, <R>where</R> where was that, to Indonesia.Then I went to Indonesia <F><?>well</?></F> through the travel agent.And the in the Japanese brochure that says all the meals were included, but in fact, I had to pay <R>extra</R> extra money to get the breakfast.<OL>I complained</OL>.But the you know, <F>urm</F> the hotel employee weren't able to understand English.And they seem to understand some words but the <F>ur</F> you know, their main tongue is Indonesian,Bahasa Indonesia.<F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> I got some kind of compliment. <R>Not</R> not meal coupon, but some kind of <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> what should I say, tour ticket <F>oh</F> and official point.Yeah.Yes.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Yeah.<F>Mm</F>. <F>Urm</F> this guy is a gentleman who is working in accounting firm. And every morning <SC>at eight</SC> <SC>eigh</SC> at eight o'clock, <R>he goes to</R> <F>mm</F> he goes <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to Shin-Okubo Station<F>ur</F> to commute to his company. And <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he looks pretty healthy and pretty strong, but in fact, he is very weak and in terms of his physical fitness. And in the second picture, <F>ur</F> if his health is of the ordinary person, probably <SC>he's ne</SC> he didn't have dropped his briefcase.But he's pretty weak so when this guy pushed <SC>his hand</SC> his arm I mean, <SC>he dropped his</SC> he drops his briefcase.Then he complains to this gentleman in the blue suit. <R>But</R> <R>but</R> <R>but</R> <R>but</R> but <SC>he doesn't ad</SC> this guy doesn't <SC>asmi</SC> admit his fault.And <SC>he didn't apologize to</SC> he doesn't apologize to this gentleman.Then the train comes and the this guy is very worried because <F>urm</F> an important document is inside his briefcase.But fortunately, <F>ur</F> his briefcase, <F>urm</F> yeah, stays just as it is. <?>It's not broken</?> at all.Then this guy ask the station <F>er</F> conductor <F>ur</F> to pick his briefcase for him. And <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he gets his briefcase back. And the after that, those two guys are going to talk about, not responsibility but the <F>ur</F> should I say, just to make themselves <F>um</F> calm and the to solve the situation.<OL><?>I'm sorry</?></OL>. <OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>Yeah, ninety minutes, yeah</OL>.<F>Ur</F> the only thing is the station is not crowded at all.<OL>So it's a</OL> very good time for reading or doing some <laughter>work</laughter>.<nvs>sigh</nvs> If possible. I'd rather prefer to commute by train.Car is O K but the probably in Japan, it's very stressful to driveto <SC>commute to your</SC> <F>uh</F> come to your work,I would say.Because road is very crowded.And the I don't want to criticize any Japanese driver, but <R>the</R> the manner of Japanese drivers are pretty bad.Some track drivers like to shout or to scream to drivers <SC?>into</SC?> <F>uh</F> <SC>next to you</SC>next to them. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Urm</F> if you commute by car, would your company pay for your fuel?<OL><??></??></OL> that is not to be <??></??>.Yeah.<OL>For this evening</OL>. <F>Ur</F> as I told you, this weekend, I'm going to move from <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> to <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>. So I have to help my wife to pick things up and pack everything in the cardboard boxes.<OL>Yeah</OL>, yeah.<OL>Yeah, thanks very much, yeah</OL>.<??></??>
