So it's not far <R>from</R> from <R><H pn="others1">Kyodo</H></R> <H pn="others1">Kyodo</H> Station.<SC>Kyodo is</SC> <F>err</F> <SC>it takes</SC> if you take the <R>su</R> subway or train from <H pn="others3">Shinjyuku</H> Station, it take about twenty minutes. And <SC><H pn="others1">Kyodo</H> Station's</SC> <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">Kyodo</H> is <F>er</F> relatively <laughter>sophisticated places</laughter>. And we have some university, <H pn="school name1">Tokyo Agricultural</H> University, so there're quite lots of interesting <F>err</F> stores and shops and good restaurants. <SC>And</SC> but still, it's <F>er</F> for residential area, so it's not so <?>crowdy</?> or industorial place. So it's quite comfortable place to live.<OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.Yes. We recently moved to <H pn="others1">Kyodo</H>, last July, actually, with <SC>our</SC> <SC>my family and</SC> yeah, <SC?>my family's</SC?> my husband and two kids. And they are twins.Yes.Yes.I delivered last March, so they will be one year old quite soon.<OL><laughter>Thank you</laughter></OL>.Actually, I didn't expect that I was pregnant at all <OL>because</OL>we didn't planned. Or <SC>we</SC> as far as I understand <?>why</?> I feel, <SC>I</SC> we didn't do nothing almost. So it was kind of "Why?". And <R>it's a</R> it's a pleasant surprise, but it was kind of shock. And I didn't really expected anything like that, so I was kind of freezed.<OL>And</OL>, therefore, <R>the</R> the one of the nurse was so worried about my face <SC>and</SC> because I didn't express my happiness or whatever. So she came to me and, "Are you all right?". <F>Er</F>. "<R>Do you</R> <SC>do you wo</SC> <F>err</F> does your <F>err</F> partner knows about this?". And she was very worried about, but, <F>ah</F> yeah, it was O K. <SC>And</SC> but it's a good because it's very, I think, efficient and productive if I have to stop the workyeah, and deliver the two kids at the same time. <CO>So</CO>.My work responsibility <?>in a</?> marketing. And <R>I'm</R> I'm the marketing managers, and work with three brand managers <F>erm</F> in a area of the <SC>tea</SC> black tea,<OL>ready</OL>-to-drink black tea as well as tea bag and leaves.And also, little bit about P R activity on tea and health.

We work with <F>er</F> partner <F>err</F> outside the <H pn="company name1">XXX05</H>, our companies, and which is <H pn="company name2">XXX06</H>.So they have very different cultures and <F>err</F> the way they do the business.And we have to always discuss, and, sometimes fight. And, yeah, it take a quite <F>err</F> long times to get the consensus, but I believe this is necessary <R>to</R> to get very competitive, yeah, product <?>mix</?>.Yes.<OL><F>Hum</F></OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <SC>This is</SC> O K, I see the snow mountain or ski resort.
