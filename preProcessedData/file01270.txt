One day last week, I and my friend planned to go camping. And <F>er</F> we prepared a lot. And <F>er</F> <SC>sh</SC> my friend, she could drive a car. So she brought her car, then <F>er</F> we drive the car. <R>Then</R> then we went to the <F>well</F> mountain. And <F>er</F> we made the camp <SC>near the</SC> near <F>well</F> side of the river. Then we cooked <F>er</F> delicious food and <F>eh</F> we enjoyed. But the suddenly, it was cloudy and it started raining.Then, we decide to go back. But <F>well</F> it was really windy and <F>eh</F> heavy raining. We were so scared and <F>eh</F> we couldn't <F>well</F> find a hotel it's <R>near</R> <F>well</F> <SC>near the ss</SC> near the river, maybe. <nvs>sniff</nvs> Then we stopped by there. Then <F>er</F> we had a good, relaxed time.<OL>So</OL> first time the we planned to do the camping. But the it was the another <laughter>holiday way</laughter>.Yeah. And <F>eh</F> we enjoyed the tea and the relaxing time over there. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.Yeah.<F>Hmm</F>.Let's see. I think there are some <SC>reasons</SC> possible reasons, but the one thing is the people live in <F>well</F> Japan, especially the urban areas, they looks really tired because of their job <R>or</R> or study or maybe the atmosphere or environment.Then the they want to see probably the green and the friendly <??></??> or peaceful place. Maybe that's why. Also the some like a children or <SC>young people</SC> young generation, <SC>they don't</SC> I'm nor sure, but <F>er</F> <R>the</R> they might not have a chance to do the outdoor activities when they were young.Maybe that's why they want to try or challenge them to do.Then maybe they prefer to do or can relax from that. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<F>Hmm</F>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Thank <OL>you</OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Ah</F>.Yeah. <OL><CO><?>That's</?></CO></OL>.Yeah.
