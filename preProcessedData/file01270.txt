Actually I was born in the area, .
Then I moved to . after that, I moved to New Zealand. So everything, you know, the first time for me in .

O K.
 New Zealand, in what, in nineteen-ninety-eight, yeah, I went to there. Then I entered the university in New Zealand. So I took the degree of the international studies.
Then I studied sociology, anthropology and then cultural studies and .
Yeah. The life is really interesting. sometimes hard, especially the language things. But after graduating the university,
 worked as a Japanese teacher in a local secondary schools.
Then after that, I have a chance to study again. So that's why I came back.
.
No.
 in .
.
. Basically, I had a contact with them by E-mail or telephone, sometimes fax.
.
 actually ,
 since I was fifteen, I started stay alone by myself. So it's O K .
 I'm not sure my parents though. But once or twice a year,
I try to meet them. Then I think it's O K.

younger one is a still university student.
Yeah. He is in .
And my father is the daily farmers. And he also studied and worked in New Zealand.

 shows seven o'clock, I think. Yeah. So maybe it's the dinner time. .
Yeah.
.
 I often went to this kind of restaurant in New Zealand. And in New Zealand, there are different kinds of wines. So I love to go. But I don't have a chance to go these restaurants in Japan, I think in .
So I wanna go, 
yeah, someday. And let's see. .
 actually now I'm cooking. 
so I cook it. And eat by myself. . And actually, when I start to live in , the time is really fast and . Then my work, teaching English, it will usually finish nine P. M.
So after that, I go back to my home and then cook a small meals and
yeah, just a few small, easy dishes,
.
.
.
.
Now, let's see, I like to go to the supermarket
because there are different and food and products are there. So it's easy for me to choose
 I want. But the time things, my work finishes eight. So it's easy for me to buy food also the some other things that it's easy for me to go to the convenience store. But for healthy thing when I think, maybe it's good things to go to the supermarket and then choose the good, healthy food. Yeah.
.

Yes. Sure.
O K. .
 I'm sorry. lost my ticket no, no, no, sorry O K. Sorry, can I start again?
Sorry. O K. Excuse me.
I'm sorry that I couldn't catch my train. So could you change my ticket, please?
 really?
Even though that the another train which I came here was accidentally late?
?
Yeah. .
Just the accident.
So I think that I can do that. Is that fine?
Yeah. Maybe would you check about the accident and then if it's yeah, if you don't mind, would you change my seat? And then otherwise I can't go to the airport. So please. .
.
Really? what should I do? my Gosh. in that case, can I change to the next train to book?
 really. How much is it?
Same price? can you discount some of it?
.
 that's too bad. Can I talk other person who in charge this kind of problem?
O K. What time will he or she come ?
O K. actually I don't have a enough time though. let's see. O K. I will buy and then book in the . Could you organize those?
 It's O K. It's not your fault, my fault.
 just the accident so it cannot be helped. So you know, so that's fine.
.
.
 usually I use the .
That line is convenient for me. But actually sometimes they have a accident. . And if I'm free and not hurry, it's O K, I'm waiting. But sometimes I really scared sometime those accident happen. For example, just twice the last year, they had the accident. And then they all stopped. But I have to go to where the I'm teaching.
And then my students will be come soon. Then my Gosh, the what should do? As soon as possible, I will call to my boss, then the I explained that. Also I called to my student I will be late. And then they understand, so it was fine. But sometimes accidentally and then suddenly happen. So sometimes I hate the trains. Yeah.

.
Yeah, I feel nervous.
?

O K.
.
.
O K. May I start?
. One day last week, I and my friend planned to go camping. And we prepared a lot. And my friend, she could drive a car. So she brought her car, then we drive the car. then we went to the mountain. And we made the camp near side of the river. Then we cooked delicious food and we enjoyed. But the suddenly, it was cloudy and it started raining.
Then, we decide to go back. But it was really windy and heavy raining. We were so scared and we couldn't find a hotel it's near the river, maybe. Then we stopped by there. Then we had a good, relaxed time.
 first time the we planned to do the camping. But the it was the another .
Yeah. And we enjoyed the tea and the relaxing time over there. .
.
.
Yeah.
.
Let's see. I think there are some possible reasons, but the one thing is the people live in Japan, especially the urban areas, they looks really tired because of their job or study or maybe the atmosphere or environment.
Then the they want to see probably the green and the friendly young generation, I'm nor sure, but they might not have a chance to do the outdoor activities when they were young.
Maybe that's why they want to try or challenge them to do.
Then maybe they prefer to do or can relax from that. .
.
 Thank .
.
.
Yeah. .
Yeah. I have a meeting after nine. .
 I know, I know. These days usually the I work the Monday, Wednesday, Saturdays.
So that today, it's the 
 go there.
