And I have to take <.></.> them to <.></.> nursery school in the morning. And they are one girl and boy.And my boy was crying <SC>during all</SC> <F>eh</F> in the morning. <F>Er</F> he didn't want to go and <F>er</F> therefore, <SC>I have to</SC> <F>mm</F> I had to be with him bit a long time at the nursery school in the morning. <F>Hm</F>.Yes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>Yes indeed</laughter>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Mm</F> I think <F>eh</F> he <F>eh</F> has a own pace of doing something and of course nursery school has a time schedule and they have to do <F>mm</F> play time or lunch time or <R>nap</R> napping time. Then sometimes <SC>he want to</SC> <F>er</F> he didn't want to <F>uu</F> join their group work,<OL>therefore</OL> he wanted to stay home, <R>p</R> playing with his miniature <.></.> car.<F>Hm</F>.Yes.Yes, they are.<F>Mm</F>. So like this morning,my girl <F>err</F> can do everything by herselfsand <SC>she is very</SC> <F>mm</F> <.></.> she is willing to join nursery school, therefore I do not take care of her so much.But not my <laughter>boy</laughter>.<F>Mm</F> I think it's <F>eh</F> really short <F>er</F> because it's only five days,from thirtieth to third <OL>of January</OL>.<F>Hm</F> and <F>eh</F> we didn't have any special event because <.></.> <SC>my parents</SC> our parents are living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, therefore we don't need to go <F>eh</F> to home or countryside in Japan. Therefore, I think <R>we</R> we stayed at home basically.<OL>Yes</OL>. Yes.<F>Mm</F> yes. <F>Hmm</F>. I think this is one of <R>ski</R> <R>ski</R> skiing place <F>mm</F> <SC>which</SC> <.></.> it's locating in Niigata Prefecture. <F>Hm</F>. <.></.> And <.></.> this is me and my husband because we are not good at skiing, and we are talking about how we spend <F>er</F> the afternoon. <F>Hm</F>. Nowadays I think snowboarding is more popular than normal ski, but this place <F>er</F> still standard skiing <F>er</F> seems popular.And <F>mm</F> kids are playing <F>er</F> snowball <JP>nanteittara</JP> <laughter>fighting</laughter>. I don't know how it's called.

Maybe the other side of the mountain, there is <SC>a course</SC> another course for <F>mm</F> <SC>high</SC> <.></.> professionals.<F>Hmm</F>. I don't know how we <laughter>are in there</laughter>, but maybe <F>eh</F> we are with kids and I wanted <SC>to</SC> them to see snow.<F>Hm</F> because in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, we rarely see snow like this.No. Not at all.<F>Er</F> maybe <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> in <SC>junior</SC> <F>oh</F> no, elementary school I had some experience.<F>Hm</F> but totally <SC>it was</SC> <F>mm</F> when <F>uh</F> I was <F>er</F> elementary school <SC>I'm a beginner</SC> I was a beginner,<F>mm</F> therefore, <SC>I <SC>could not</SC> <SC?>sh</SC?> <?>don't</?></SC> I could not enjoy <?>therefore</?> skiing.<F>Mm</F>.
