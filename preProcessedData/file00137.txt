   one day,  the woman  went to department store to buy a tie.    it was for  her husband   birthday present.    she asked     to  a clerk for help, and    he recommended her a green tie.   and then  she bought it, and she asked     where  the wallets.         he asked that  there are  in   forth floor. So she  went to  the forth floor, and    she also bought a wallet for his husband.

      I bought  C Ds for my friend.
