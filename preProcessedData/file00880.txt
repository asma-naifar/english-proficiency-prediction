 the snow is very  deep. And    I like Nagano.
? .  in Nagano,  I like   Nagano. I like some sports in Nagano because  Nagano  has a lot of  forest and good mountains and   nature. . Now I live in Saitama. Saitama      doesn't have forest, good nature, good mountain so
I like Nagano.

 travel.
      taking the train.   if you take the train,   you can get to Nagano Station on time. And    while  relaxing. But I recommend you to drive a car because         good scenery spot is almost    too distance from station.        if you drive,   you can get to the good spot easily.
