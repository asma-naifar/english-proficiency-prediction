My name is . .
.
 I'm really good. How are ?
 I live in which is in . . Station's on the line. It's about thirty minutes from here.
 quiet town. a lot of town, I think. . There's a good ,
yeah, I enjoy living there. . My family have been living there for more than thirty years.
 when I was in elementary school. I lived there four and a half years.
Quite different .
. Mainly the people, of course, the scenery and the atmosphere is different. But what make the atmosphere different is the people, I think. .
.
 I enjoyed the summer camp which I can with my brother and sister. we had a lot of outside of town. Also, we enjoyed swimming, playing tennis. Also, we had we learned a lot . .
.
 I watch movies. And I'm also thinking about being a script translator. in that context, I try to compare the original words and the translation of the script.
. Because you have to really good parts of the original script are totally just . But maybe the translation shouldn't just bother the pictures. they say good translations just support the movie and it shouldn't be the main part. So, I think it's a little bit difficult not to just stress what you really want to say.
 describe the scenery? . I think it's a ski resort and it's sort of crowded. And people are skiing but, it seem kids just playing with snow. And I don't think they are really good skiers. . This picture doesn't show they are skiing faster. They seem to maybe stay in one place instead of skiing the hill. And there's nobody on the lift. . .
Would that be all right?
.
.
I do.
 I think you have to pay for the cost that the owner of the maintain the place during summer time. so, the costs are just borrowing the ski, maybe include those kind of costs.
No, I don't think so. Because many young Japanese enjoy by getting there by their own car. And actually, they don't stay for long. Japanese skiers just don't stay overnight. They go just enjoy for the day.
. you can get to these places maybe in two hours from .
.
.
 .
 what's the particular reason that you I can think of?
O K.
 Yes. I actually missed the train I was suppose to get on. Because my baby was screaming, crying and I had just comforting her. .
I'm sorry. But, I don't have anyone to take care of her. I have to do it myself. So, please change this would you change this ticket to the next train, please?
 I can just hold my baby and stand inside the train. Would that be all right?
 have to sit down I don't need the seat. I can just stand in the corridor.
.
 thank you.
 I not do that again.
 not me, but my mother has. She missed a plane to Hokkaido. We were on family vacation to skiing in Hokkaido. And she was late in packing up her baggage. .
No. She was crying. 
 to be careful. . And just always keep your seatbelt buckled.
. Otherwise, don't get on any plane. 
.
. . I was driving and I was on a way to see my girl friend. . I'm going to change the story. I'm . I was driving to a library. a he might have been talking to his girl friend or something. And it seemed that he didn't notice me coming up. And we just bumped into each other. but instead of being apologized, he came up angry with me that he dropped his cellular phone and I . So, I used my cellular phone to call up a police. people came to pick up his broken scooter.
. But a funny story. 
. How it's broken? . I explain accident. And it seems that the rear right was broken.
 I'm not good at these. . Isn't the light just broken, no?
? Excuse me?
. I'm not sure about that. Because the roads wide and we have only just one road. So, people have to be careful by themselves, I think. And there's no way to expand the road or maybe the conditions are not that bad. But because it's so crowded, people have to be careful with each other.
No, I don't.
 accident when I was in college. And I think I wasn't wrong but the person I got into the accident was wrong. . He was a very frightening man. And he just kept on calling me for about I didn't want to drive again. 
.
. Today? I have to go to work. I have a work as a secretary to a professor in . And after that, maybe I'll go to see a movie with my friend.
 I haven't decided yet. But I am thinking about "Billy Elliot" which is England movie. And I better British. And there's a boy that he wants to be a ballerina very much. But his father is upset about it. Yeah.
But I think mak he makes his way to be a very good one.
.
Thank you. And have a good day.
