My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <CO><OL>And please</OL></CO>.<OL>Please</OL>.<F>Erm</F> I'm really good. How are <OL>you</OL>?<F>Erm</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> which is in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. <F>Erm</F>. Station's on the <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> line. It's about thirty minutes from here.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL> yes. It's <F>er</F> quiet town. <F>Erm</F> <SC>many people</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <?>there is</?> <F>erm</F> a lot of <F>erm</F> <??></??> and kids around the town. And it's comfortable, nice <F>erm</F> town, I think. <F>Erm</F>. There's a good <laughter>supermarket</laughter> <OL>and</OL>,yeah, I enjoy <F>erm</F> living there. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F>. My <R>fa</R> family have been living there for more than thirty years.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL> actually I lived in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> when I was in elementary school. <F>Erm</F> I lived there four and a half years.Quite different <laughter>from <H pn="others5">XXX07</H></laughter>. <OL>Yeah, <?>different</?></OL>.<F>Errm</F>. Mainly the people, <.></.> the most big difference. <F>Erm</F> of course, the scenery and the <F>erm</F> atmosphere is different. But what make the atmosphere different is the people, I think. <OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mmm</F>.<OL><F>Err</F></OL> <F>well</F> I enjoyed <F>erm</F> the summer camp <F>erm</F> which I can <?>get</?> with my brother and sister. <F>Erm</F> we had a lot of <??></??> <F>erm</F> outside of town. Also, we enjoyed <F>erm</F> swimming, playing tennis. Also, we had <F>erm</F> <??></??> play, <F>erm</F> <SC>we spent a lot of</SC> <F>er</F> we learned a lot <??></??> at <F>erm</F> <.></.> lot of <F>erm</F> <.></.> <??></??>. <F>Hmm</F>.<F>Mmm</F>.<F>Erm</F> I watch movies. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And I'm also thinking about <F>erm</F> being a script translator. <.></.> So, <F>erm</F> in that context, I try to <F>erm</F> <R>com</R> <F>erm</F> compare the original words and the <F>erm</F> <JP>jimaku</JP> <SC>which is the <F>erm</F> <.></.> translate</SC> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> it's <F>er</F> translation of the script.<F>Mmm</F>. Because <F>erm</F> you have to <F>erm</F> <.></.> put it into very short words. The original sometimes the <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> really good parts of the <F>er</F> original script are totally <F>erm</F> just <.></.> <F>er</F> <.></.> erased out. <F>Hmm</F>. But <F>erm</F> maybe <R>the</R> <F>erm</F> the translation shouldn't just bother the pictures. <F>Erm</F> they say good translations just <F>erm</F> support the movie and <F>erm</F> it shouldn't be the main part. So, <F>erm</F> I think it's a little bit difficult not to just <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>s</R> stress what you really want to say.<F>Mm</F> describe the scenery? <F>Erm</F>. <SC>It's</SC> <F>er</F> I think it's a ski resort and <F>erm</F> <SC>there's a lot of</SC> <R>i</R> it's sort of crowded. And people are <F>erm</F> skiing but, it seem <.></.> to be <F>erm</F> kids <F>erm</F> just playing with snow. And I don't think they are really good skiers. <F>Erm</F>. This picture doesn't show they are <F>erm</F> skiing faster. They seem to <F>erm</F> maybe <R>s</R> stay in one place instead of <F>erm</F> skiing the hill. And there's nobody on the lift. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <CO>Should I describe <OL>how many</OL></CO>.Would that be all right?<F>Hm</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.I do.<F>Ermm</F> I think you have to pay for the <F>erm</F> cost that the owner of the <F>erm</F> <.></.> resort to <F>erm</F> maintain the place <F>um</F> during summer time. <F>Erm</F> so, <F>ur</F> the costs are just borrowing the ski, <SC>it also</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> the prices also <F>erm</F> maybe include <.></.> those kind of costs.No, I don't think so. Because <F>erm</F> many young Japanese enjoy <F>erm</F> by getting there by their own car. And <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> <F>erm</F> actually, they don't stay for long. Japanese skiers just <F>erm</F> don't stay overnight. They <SC>just <F>erm</F> go</SC> <R>j</R> just <SC>the</SC> <F>erm</F> enjoy for the day.<OL>Yes</OL>. <F>Erm</F> you can <F>erm</F> get to these places <F>erm</F> <SC>maybe in a</SC> maybe in two hours from <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Um</F>.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. <F>Uh</F> <OL><F>erm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL>. Yeah. <F>Erm</F> what's the particular reason that you <.></.> would <F>ei</F> <OL><F>eh</F> I can <R>thin</R> <R>thin</R> think of</OL>?O K.<OL><F>Huh</F></OL>. <F>erm</F> Yes. <F>Erm</F> I actually <F>erm</F> missed the train I was suppose to get on. Because my <F>erm</F> baby was screaming, crying and <SC>I ha</SC> <F>uh</F> I had <laughter>trouble</laughter> just <R>com</R> comforting her. <CO>So</CO>.I'm sorry. But, <SC>I had</SC> <F>er</F> I don't have anyone to take care of her. <SC>Except</SC> I have to do it myself. So, <SC>could you kindly <F>erm</F> please</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>can I <.></.> change this</SC> <F>erm</F> would you change this ticket to the next train, please?<F>Erm</F> I can just hold my baby and stand <.></.> inside the train. Would that be all right?<F>Erm</F> <SC>I don't <.></.> have to sit down</SC> <SC>I don't have</SC> I don't need the seat. I can just stand <F>erm</F> in the corridor.<laughter>Thank you so much</laughter>.<F>Oh</F> thank you.<OL><??></??></OL> happen <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> I <F>erm</F> not <R>do</R> do that again.<F>Er</F> not me, but my mother has. She missed <SC>a train</SC> <F>er</F> a <R>pla</R> plane to Hokkaido. We were <F>erm</F> on <F>er</F> family <.></.> <R>va</R> <F>erm</F> vacation to <F>erm</F> skiing in Hokkaido. And she was <F>erm</F> late in packing up her baggage. <nvs>laugher</nvs> <CO><laughter><R>She</R></laughter> she</CO>.No. <nvs>laughter</nvs> She was crying. <nvs>laugher</nvs><OL>No, you have</OL> to be careful. <F>Erm</F>. And just always keep your seatbelt <.></.> buckled.<F>Mmm</F>. Otherwise, don't get on any plane. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Um</F>. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>I was driving</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>I was on</SC> I was driving and <F>erm</F> I was on a way to see my girl friend. <CO>But <F>erm</F> <.></.> it was</CO>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm going to change the story. I'm <laughter>sorry</laughter>. <F>Erm</F> I was driving to a library. <.></.> And <F>erm</F> <.></.> <?>there was</?> a <.></.> man on a scooter completely absorbed in talking on a cell phone <?>thinking</?> he might have been talking to his girl friend or something. And <F>erm</F> it seemed that he didn't notice <F>erm</F> me coming up. And we just bumped into each other. <SC>He</SC> but <F>erm</F> <SC>I think</SC> instead of <F>erm</F> being apologized, <F>erm</F> he came up angry with me that <SC>he sort of</SC> <F>erm</F> he dropped his cellular phone and I <.></.> ran over it. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. So, I used my cellular phone to call up a police. <R>And</R> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> and the <F>er</F> people came to pick up his broken scooter.<OL>Yeah</OL>. But a funny story. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Ahh</F></OL>. <F>Uh-huh</F>. How it's broken? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <R>B</R> <SC>b</SC> I explain <F>erm</F> <.></.> the police, I think <F>err</F> <.></.> that I'm in the <F>er</F> accident. And it seems that the <SC>right</SC> rear <.></.> <F>erm</F> right was broken.<.></.> <F>Erm</F> I'm not good at these. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. Isn't the light just broken, no?<.></.> <F>Huh</F>? Excuse me?<F>Ahh</F>. <F>Well</F> I'm not sure about that. Because <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> first <?>of all</?> the roads <SC>are very</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> they are not <F>erm</F> wide and we have only just one road. So, <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> <SC>you ha</SC> people have to be careful by themselves, I think. And there's no way to <R>e</R> expand the road or <.></.> <F>uh</F> maybe <.></.> <F>erm</F> the conditions are not that bad. But <.></.> <F>erm</F> because it's so crowded, people have to be careful with each other.No, I don't.<OL>I had a terrible</OL> accident when I was in college. And I think I wasn't wrong but the person <SC>I bump</SC> <F>erm</F> I got <.></.> just <F>erm</F> into the accident <R>was</R> was wrong. <F>Erm</F>. He was a very frightening man. And he just <R>k</R> kept on calling me for about <.></.> half a year and <R>I</R> I didn't want to drive again. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mmm</F>.<F>Erm</F>. Today? <F>Erm</F> I have to go to work. I <F>erm</F> have a work as a secretary to a professor <SC>at the</SC> <F>erm</F> in <H pn="school name1">XXX08</H>. And after that, maybe <F>em</F> I'll go to see a movie <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> with my friend</OL>.<F>Erm</F> I haven't decided yet. But I am thinking about <F>erm</F> "Billy Elliot" which <F>er</F> is <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>English</SC> <F>erm</F> England <F>er</F> movie. And <F>erm</F> <SC>I've been</SC> I better <?>say</?> British. And <F>erm</F> there's a boy that he wants to be a ballerina <.></.> very much. But his father is upset about it. Yeah.But I think <R>he <F>erm</F> mak</R> <F>erm</F> he makes his way to be a very good one.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Thank you. And have a good day.
