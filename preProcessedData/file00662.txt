And I stayed there about for one week. and while I was staying there at my friends' house, we went to Banff Jasper and some other places with my friends. And yeah, I think it was really a nice trip.

O K. . One day last week, a woman went to department store to buy something for her husband. what shall I say, so she decided to get tie for him. And she chose nice tie. the color was green and yellow. . no, she bought this for his birthday. And O K, she bought it for him. paid for this no, she paid thousand yen for this neck tie. and she no, and then she went to other section. And found some she found something good. . . So the department store has final sale. And she found a good shoes and and a shirt and blouse, too. And she bought a pair of shoes and some clothes for herself. And finally, she went out of the department and went home.
 I think so in the department store, we can buy many kinds of things. So in a boutique or very small shop, the goods are almost everything. Shoes and shirts and food, almost everything. So I think this is a big advantage about a department store.
.
O K.
. Plan? I just want to go home, and have a no, what, dinner with my husband. And I want to go to bed a little earlier than usual because I have slight cold.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
O K.
