  one day last week, there were two sisters who were planning to go to go camping in the mountains.   so they prepared  to go camping. The younger sister got the tent ready, and the old sister   was packing the torch. And surprise, that they were going to eat over there. And they packed their bags and they went on the car and they set off.  They arrived at the camping ground.  And they put the tent up. Besides the tent, they had curry ready and rice so they could eat it for dinner. After they put the tent up, the rain started falling heavily. So they decided that they couldn't spend the night here because it was getting worse and worse. So the tent blowed away and all the foods and the chairs also blown away. So the rain was getting really strong. So they decided to go to the car, get on the car, and they went to a nearest hotel. They went to the Hotel Cosmos. And they stayed there that night  so they didn't  have to get wet in the rain.

And it's tomorrow.
So I have to practice for that.
