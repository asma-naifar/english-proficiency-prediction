My name is . Nice to meet you.

 then, I took them all. And I go to the, I'm sorry, bathroom. And I'll take shower for about twenty minutes. And I set my hair. I use for set my hair. So old movie's mother, I look like. but, to set harder with my curlers, I eat breakfast. . Then I put off the curlers. . I do some foundation or put the lipstick.
. This is the picture in a restaurant. The restaurant is very gorgeous and fancy one. And there are some tables in this restaurant. all the guests are couples. . . And it is seven o'clock because I can see the big clock in front of the wall. And, in front of me, there is a couple. . Both of them wear formal dresses. And boy is serving a bottle of red wine for them. The guy of the couple is tasting a glass of wine. And, maybe, he chose that bottle. And he is tasting the red wine.
. The last time when I wear formal dress, I wore wedding party. . It was about one year ago.
Because it was late autumn. So it was cold outside to wear light . I have some , but I don't have much opportunity to wear. So, sometimes if I had a chance, I try to wear instead of dress.
O K.
Yes, I bought this skirt yesterday in this shop. . It was very nice, I thought. But, when I came back home, and I show it to my husband, it is too short for my age, he said.
So, if it is O K, can I change to the longer one? I saw in the shelf yesterday clothes and same design, but longer one.
.
. If I pay extra money, can I change it to the longer one?
 actually, it is a little bit tight for me as I said. But I bought this blouse as you see it's my first time to say like this. Is it O K to change? I will pay extra charge.
. . . Yeah, sure. 
No, I haven't any experience like that.
 can change.
I consider mostly about the texture and color most important thing for me is the color.
I like basic colors like beige or black or dark blue.
. if I had a nice skirt, it will fit to like I said. and I can put lipstick or red lipstick as I like. So, if I had the basic color skirt, I can put some colors for accent or for accessories.
