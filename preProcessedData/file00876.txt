Then I put off the curlers. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F>. I do some <F>er</F> <.></.> foundation or put the lipstick.<F>Erm</F>. This is the picture in a restaurant. The restaurant is very <SC>gorgeous look</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <R>gor</R> gorgeous and fancy one.

It was about <SC>ha</SC> one year ago.Because it was <F>erm</F> late autumn. So it was cold outside to wear <F>er</F> light <F>er</F> <.></.> dress with silk or something. So I decided to wear <JP>kimono</JP>. I have some <JP>kimonos</JP>, but <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> I don't have much opportunity to wear. So, sometimes if I <R>had a</R> <F>er</F> had a chance, <SC>I tr</SC> <R>I</R> I try to wear <JP>kimono</JP> instead of <F>er</F> dress.O K.Yes, <F>erm</F> I bought this skirt yesterday in this <F>er</F> shop. <F>Ur</F>.

If I pay extra money, can I change it to the longer one?<.></.> But, <F>erm</F> actually, <nvs>laughter</nvs> it is a little bit <F>er</F> tight for me as I said. But <F>erm</F> <.></.> it <F>erm</F> <.></.> not your fault. But <F>er</F> I bought <F>er</F> this blouse as you <R>se</R> see <F>er</F> <R>in</R> <.></.> in not a sales price yesterday. So <SC>how</SC> it's my first time to say like this. Is it O K to change? <SC>I can pay</SC> <SC>I</SC> I will pay extra charge.<F>Ur</F>. <OL>Thank you</OL>. <F>Ur</F>. Yeah, sure. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>No, I haven't any experience like that.<OL><SC>All the</SC></OL> most of all the shop <.></.> <F>ur</F> can change.I consider mostly about the texture and <F>ur</F> color <.></.> and size. <laughter><??></??></laughter> is sure, but <F>er</F> most important thing for me is the color.I like basic colors like beige or black or dark blue.<F>Erm</F>. <SC>I can</SC> <F>er</F> if I had a <F>er</F> nice skirt, <SC>it fit</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> it will fit to <.></.> all of the color <SC>like the</SC> <F>er</F> like I said. <F>Erm</F> and <F>er</F> I can put <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> <.></.> orange <R>lip</R> lipstick or red lipstick as I like. So, <SC>the basic</SC> if I had the basic color skirt, <F>er</F> I can <.></.> put some colors for accent or for accessories.<CO>Both of the girls</CO>. <F>Ur</F>. <OL><?>Yes</?></OL>.<..></..> O K. <.></.> One day last week, this is me, and <SC>my</SC> this is my friend, Ryoko. And <SC>we went</SC> we had a plan to <SC>go to the</SC> go to camping. <.></.> <R>We</R> <SC>we had a</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I have</SC> I had a car. <F>Er</F>. I had <R>ye</R> yellow big <F>erm</F> recreational <?>vehicle</?>. So <R>we</R> <.></.> <F>erm</F> we prepared <F>er</F> food and tent to my <F>erm</F> knapsack, and put it into my car. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. I decided <SC>to</SC> the place for camping. It is near the lake. <F>Er</F>. <.></.> <SC>We put the tent</SC> <F>er</F> <R>we built</R> we built the tent <F>er</F> <R>near</R> near the lake. And we baked some food. And <SC>it is very fine day</SC> it was very fine day. So we enjoyed the great scenery and <F>ur</F> cool <F>er</F> nice <?>beer</?> near the lake. <.></.> But, suddenly, the rain <SC>falls</SC> <F>er</F> felled. <F>Er</F>. <.></.> The cloud was black. And <R>the</R> the rain was very heavy. We were surprised to see because, before that, <F>er</F> it was very fine. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. <.></.> We try to <F>er</F> tidy up these <F>er</F> tent or the food. But <SC>it was</SC> the wind was very heavy. So we <SC>couldn't <F>er</F> do</SC> <F>er</F> couldn't tidy up these things. <F>Er</F>. We rushed into the car and drive. It was only thing that <SC>I</SC> we could do. <F>Er</F>. <.></.> When I <SC>dri</SC> drove in front of the hotel, <F>er</F> even <R>the</R> <F>mm</F> <.></.> the sound of the <F>er</F> <.></.> rolling was there, and <F>er</F> I found hotel. <SC>It</SC> <F>ur</F> we thought that it is <F>er</F> kind of a help. <F>Um</F>. <R>I</R> I plan to stay <F>er</F> one night <SC>in tent</SC> in the tent. But <F>er</F> I could find the hotel. <SC>It</SC> we were so lucky. <.></.> <F>Er</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F>. <SC>We s</SC> we checked in the hotel and <F>er</F> <SC>take</SC> took the bath and <F>erm</F> drink a hot coffee to warm our <R>body</R> body. <F>Erm</F>. It was a miserable day. But we were lucky to find that hotel.Yes, I have.I see. <F>Er</F>. <.></.> Actually, <R>to</R> <.></.> to lay down on the <F>er</F> ground is little bit hard. My body <SC>were</SC> was <R>ach</R> aching. But, <SC>most</SC> <F>er</F> comparing to stay hotel, <SC>it is uncomfortable</SC> but it was uncomfortable. But, anyway the silence is great. I could hear <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> the insects singing or <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> the silence itself is very nice. And <F>er</F> <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <F>err</F> the darkness <SC>of the outsi</SC> of outside was fine. <SC>Very</SC> <SC>it was very ex</SC> <F>er</F> it was a good experience for me.Yes. <OL><laughter><??></??></laughter></OL>.Yes, we did.We've been changed my mind to English mode.Ten o'clock till five o'clock.<OL><?>From</?> Saturday and Sunday, both</OL>.Even in a lunch time, <SC>we talked</SC> we tried to talk in English.Yes, <SC>that's</SC> it was my first experience <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to have a day <F>er</F> <SC>even in English</SC>even all in <OL>English</OL>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
