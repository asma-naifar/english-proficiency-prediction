 one day last week maybe my father went to his work he goes to the station first, and on a platform, there are many people. So unfortunately he dropped the bag on a rail by being bumped by the other person. And my father really got angry with the person who bumped him. the things got worse. While he was complained about dropping the bag on the rail to the person bumped him, the train came over and his bag was hitted on the train. But after the train passed by, he found out the bag was safe 'cause the bag fortunately was on the middle of the rail. So the wheel of the train didn't smash.
What could I say, didn't smash his bag. Then, finally, the staff in the train station got his bag from the rail. And he could receive his own bag safely.

Yes.
.
No, not specially, but I'm really scared about the accident at Shin Okubo. Yes.
Yes. I was very sorried about two men who were trying to help drunk man and hitted by train 'cause they have really good courage. And also I admire them a lot.
 but by watching T V by watching the parents from Korea by T V makes me really sad.
.
Made me really sad. .

I didn't know that. But they should. .
. I think they should.
