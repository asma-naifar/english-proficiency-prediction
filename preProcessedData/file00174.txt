.     it  last  about five or six months.
  because I  love  winter sports such as,  ski or snowboard,  so I like winter.
Yes.
.
  I'm a single.
  I live in  for  four years.   before that, I live in .          from the  living  of , I live   by myself.  so it is  more than eight years ,
by myself.
 it is very    interesting  and   enjoyable.
.
Because,    I can manage  my time by myself.
.

    I always    good sleep</SC> have a good sleep and  go shopping or  go to tennis or some sports.
 yes. But  
 until  about noon       have a good sleep  help me    being  very  healthy.
 I think so.
 relax?   I mentioned sleeping or sports   or listening music.
 I like  rock music or pop music.
.  Especially British one, .
  because       compare to the American music,  the British music are  suitable for Japanese people.   especially  in the   not melody but the   sentence or  what they saying  is very   interesting for me.
Yes.
 That's a thing I love.          this is about           ski sites.  and  someone are skiing  and childrens are      throwing snows.  And  some of the skier are resting in the  cottage.   .
. That's very  good question.        major ski resorts   provide us  very     luxurious    someone,   restaurants or the scale of the course          and   equipments are very   well prepared.  but    such as  resort ski  is very crowded .  But the    local ski   places are not  enough  equipment or     less courses  than  resort one. But,  the local ski sites are not so crowded. So we can ski       very freely  in local ones. . So I like local one is    suitable for me.
 because I love to  only ski   not in the restaurants.

 Italy.
 really?
  I visited only the Bali Island,  so  it was the       such   resort. So,     I don't visit Jakarta or some big cities. So,  the impression for me is  the  very beautiful beach and    very oriental   buildings or people or food. So that's    that's pretty place.
Last week.
.
.         ,   one day last week, it was  rainy day. The two,  young couple walk  along the street and   had a  enjoyable conversation. And       they heard     something is  calling them.    it was  a cat.  she found the cat in the box and she wanted to take her to their home.   but he refused that.  but finally,  she persuade him to take   the cat to their home. So  finally    they take the cat to their home.
That's all.
Yes. I love  both of cats  and  dogs.
  when I was a child,     a bird called   was in my house.
But no cats or dogs,  I've never had.
. In the future, I like to have dogs.
.
           very     what else,     because  I think that dogs  likes to be with   human  always. But cats are   relatively    play themselves. So,   I like  to care  more about animals. So I like  dogs.
Yes.
Yes.
