Sure,  my name is ,    please call me .
.
 not so bad.
. Busy and    little  I'm coughing. 
I don't think so  because  I got over a cold already.   one week ago, I got the cold in Cincinnati because I stayed Cincinnati  just   until last Monday,
so  last week, I was so busy, and I got a cold, but  almost I got over the cold so this is  just  the last remain of my cold.
.
Yes.
.
 the main big difference is    of course, responsibility. . When I was a student, my responsibility was very small, or almost nothing. .  actually, this is a first day to work   in  after   my English training.
But  already,  I'm feeling there're  some responsibility
for my job 
that is the   biggest difference
for me.
My job?  I'm working in  Finance Division, and then   I mean,     in Finance Division, my department is hedge fund department.   actually, the name is different, but       name hedge fund department is enough to explain  my department,
so my responsibility  or  our department  responsibility is introducing the hedge funds for Japanese investor.  Japanese investor is  the manager of pensions or the manager of  like  some  investors  like 
   life insurance or some insurance company like  
Insurance Company.

yeah,  they  investing the big money, 
money.
.
. ?
  the biggest hobby is   reading books, and   I like to take a nap . Even though I'm working, sometimes I took .
So, my colleagues called me, "Hey, , what are you doing now?".

.
.
.
   this picture shows  a scene in the room in the house.    it looks like  the typical room in Japanese house  because  excuse me,  the room is not so big, but not so small. And then,    there is    sorry, a  audio set, and then, the single bed. It's not so big. And then,  there is a desk.  on the desk,  there is a    personal computer and typewriter. And then,  the  girl is sitting  on the chair.    no, 
I mean,  I believe this is  the    typical scene in a typical room in typical Japanese house.
, typical, typical.
In my house, yes, I have.
 she has a bigger room than I .
My room is almost    a half as large as her room. .      I'm just wondering,  do you know   the measure of ?
?
Yeah. My room is just  six , but  I guess  
is  twelve  or fifteen . Yeah.
.
Yeah,   my room is not typical, but typical room in .
Yeah. 
not typical in Japan, but typical 
.

O K. Can I have a second?
Thanks.
. O K. I'm ready. .
.
Yes.  will it be possible for you? I'd like to change  this clothes because  I got this one yesterday, but  actually,    when I bought this one,   I like this. .
.
Yeah. But     I've never tried that. This is  just new clothes.   I bought this one, and then,  I brought my house. And then,  I took this one just now.
   yes, I did, I mean,  but, you know, that     everyone changes his or her mind very easily, and then, I change it, so I'd like to change to the new one.
No. No. No. No. Because I've never tried that. Just I'd like to change a new one, and then, maybe   you don't need to refund, just replace.  I'd like to replace this one to the another one. Maybe     I can choose the another one    which is same price  as this. And then, you don't need to change the receipt.  you don't need to change    any transaction. Just change. 
easy.
.
O K. Thanks.
.
.
Sure.
.  airplane ticket to New York because    as you may know,  
 we have a seminar in a New York. And then, we have to buy the airplane ticket to New York.
  we had  several choices.  the one is buying  on the Internet, and second one is buying in the travel agency.      sorry,  just two choices. 
I mean  then,  we chose the travel agency's method because    we'd like to speak with native speaker. On the Internet, 
 it was very 
, but     we couldn't speak to anyone.   I mean,  we is  my colleagues and I, and then, we chose to buy   in the travel agency. And then,   if you want to buy  airplane ticket or rent a car in the United States,   you can go to the travel agency, and then,     you can order, "I'd like to blab blab blab" or "I'd like to blab blab blab" or "Could I have blab blab blab, please?" something like that, and then  you can get the ticket. And you have to pay some  agency fee or commission fee because  they're working for you, so you have .
Yeah, .
English ?
Right.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
So you mean, I need the past tense? O K. . .
Yeah, just a second.
 for me, but  I need to build up   story, . .
 O K.  . . .
Yeah.  that was    kind of  interesting story,   but    it can appeared  on your life or on my life  anytime, anywhere. So, one day last week,   some guy   drove a car on the road.    it was   local way. It's not highway or it's not freeway. And then, the other side,   the  other guy   rode on    I mean,   a scooter, and then  while he drove a scooter,      let's see,  he called to  his girlfriend.  and then, suddenly,   they run into the each other  on the road.  and then,  a guy    who rode on a scooter,      he  his cell phone   from his hand. And then,  of course,   it was a kind of the accident, so   they complained with each other. But,  actually,   no, I mean, I believe  or I think  everybody can believe      driving and calling at the same time  is not good. So,  it was  his fault     who rode on the scooter and who called to girlfriend, so   a driver   who drove a car   explained that situation  to the police.   excuse me,   and the   police believed that. And then,  finally,   a guy  who rode on a scooter,        he lost a scooter. And then, his scooter towed to somewhere.  that was   this picture's scenario, so it's   kind of typical scenario  on the road.
.

?
  you mean my work 
I hope, not I believe, not I guess, I hope I'd like to finish my job until seven o'clock or eight .
Yeah. .
Yeah,   if it can be true, that's nice.
But ,
I'm not sure.
 sure, and then actually,  in a reality, maybe, I have to work until nine o'clock or ten o'clock.
.
 no problem.
 so glad to speak English because after  I went to back to Japan,  I can't speak .
So, now I'm very happy to speak English.
.
You, too. Thanks.
