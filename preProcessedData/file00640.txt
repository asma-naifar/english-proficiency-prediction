Actually, after I was staying at Indianapolis,for <SC>nine</SC> ten months,I traveled around the United States for <SC>two</SC> three months.Yeah. And <F>er</F> it was awesome experience. <OL>Yeah</OL>.The most?<F>Er</F> I liked San Francisco most.<OL>Because</OL> <.></.> actually, this is a very famous city.And <F>er</F> before I went there, I thought it must be so big city.But it was actually pretty big city. But it was not really a huge city.
