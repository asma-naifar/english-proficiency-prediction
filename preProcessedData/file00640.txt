 I'm .
 meet you.
How? .

subway.
. Actually, it was like my apartment to the station, it was like five minutes walking.
And I took train for fifteen minutes.
And I came here walking
. .
Yeah. That was not too bad. .
Yeah. I usually like ride a motorcycle,
 to school but it was raining yesterday.
So I left my motorcycle school. So,
I didn't take it today.
.
 I live in Koenji.
Yeah.
 .
 It's actually very good place to live. it's like mixture of traditional and a modern culture, I think.
Yeah.
 Actually, I used to live in like Kami-igusa. You know ?
 kind of far away from here.
 I used to live in Kami-igusa for two years. And after that, I went to the United States for one year.
 living in Indianapolis .
 back here to Tokyo,
and started to live in Koenji.
.
. 
. In here?
. I study English literature mostly.
Yeah. I major in English literature but I am thinking about going to graduate school after I graduate from university.
And if I go to graduate school, I think I'm gonna major in communication or journalism or anything like that. Yeah.
I'm not sure though.
My hobby? Well, I like to listen to music. I like to watch movies. I like to ride motorcycle. 
 .
 Any kind. I like to read comic books and novels and mysteries.
Yeah.
.
Well, actually, there are so many comic books.
And , you know, everybody has his or her own taste.
So I don't know if my taste,
 like very good for you or not.
 . . "Silent Service".
 comic book about like he's writing about the war situation.
And a submarine .
Yeah.
Yeah. It's a very, very long story ,
it's a really complicated story. So it's kind of hard to explain ,
but it's very interesting. Yeah.
. .
.
Describe? How?
. O K. . This is a cat lying on a car.
And these two womens are chatting on the street.
And one of them has a dog. And here is a man running on the street.
Here's a man reading a newspaper. And it looks like this is a small town or something.
And many people live here. . It's a really peaceful town, I think. 
And these kids are playing with ball.
And these are two dogs,
 looking at each other.
And yeah, yeah, it's a really peaceful town. And I don't think it's really a center of downtown or anything.
It's probably a suburb of any city, I think.
O K?
? what is that?
.
 yeah.
. I did. .
 No. Actually, it was not.
Because actually, the place I was living was Indianapolis. And it was no really big city.
And it was no really small town. . It was kinda, you know, middle-class .
And there was pretty many people living around my neighborhood. But Indianapolis didn't look like this because Indianapolis was really, really cold region. Yeah. It was almost freezing.
. So this picture looks like, you know, it was pretty warm place to live. And it is really nice climate. But Indianapolis was really horrible, ,
in terms of climate.
Yeah. It was cold.
Yeah.
Indianapolis?
. Let me see. Well, I don't know if it's very good as an answer.
But I think the most exciting, interesting thing I thought was, probably, I met a lot of people from all over the world.
And I made a lot of friends from overseas.
And that was the most important for me, .
.
.
Yeah.
.
.
.
O K. 
Yeah. Sure.
 Yes. Actually, I had a reserved seat of the train which just left,
from this station. And I was supposed to get on the train.
 actually, I'm kind of late to get . So I couldn't get on the train. . But I still have this ticket. So could you please get me back ?
. . Yeah. I was pretty busy. I mean I took another train to come here.
And this was supposed to be on time to arrive here.
But it was actually kind of late.
Five minutes late.
 if the train was not late, I could get the train.
 I think I have nothing bad .
And I think I deserve to get back my money.
 So can I talk to another person who is responsible for that?
Yeah. Sure. Thanks.
 really?
O K. .
 yeah. Sure. Actually, after I was staying at Indianapolis,
for ten months,
I traveled around the United States for three months.
Yeah. And it was awesome experience. .
The most?
 I liked San Francisco most.
 actually, this is a very famous city.
And before I went there, I thought it must be so big city.
But it was actually pretty big city. But it was not really a huge city. It was pretty compact.
 but a lot of people live there.
 and actually, people over there were, like pretty diverse. People from all over the world. People of like many races. And there are so many cultures from all over the world in small one city.
And it was really interesting.
And I made a lot of friends in San Francisco. So, yeah, if I live in United States again, I hope I can live in San Francisco. Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yeah. Sure.
.
.
. can I start with "One day last week,"
 bla, bla, bla?
 all right . And am I assigned the person I'm supposed to be?
. O K. I was driving as usual. But there was a motorcycle riding against me. And actually, he was not only riding a motorcycle. He was actually talking on the phone as well I think he was careless at all. And I was driving as usual. So I had no fault at all. But actually, we clashed. I clashed into the motorcycle. And the motorcycle was kind of broken. And the guy who was riding motorcycle talked to me. And he blamed me for a policeman came to check the accident. And I told the policeman that the motorcycle guy was talking on the phone when he was, like riding a motorcycle. And I explained everything. And I explained that I was not responsible for the accident, he was. policema and policeman understood the situation. And he talked to somebody on the phone. And he called for a truck. And came to the place of the accident. And the truck towed the motorcycle away.
.
Yeah. Sure.
.
. Yeah. Actually, I have a license but I don't have a car. .
.
Yeah.
Well, actually not like this though. I had an accident two or three years ago. I was riding motorcycle. And actually, in that situation, I was just careless. And I clashed into a car.
Yeah. .
 Well, my motorcycle went broken.
And the car I clashed into was also broken as well a little bit. And the driver of the car and I were both, like safe at all.
And we were both fine. So we didn't go to hospital or anything. But we talked to each other and make solution like paying money or something. Yeah.
.
Well, it went kind of trouble. But,
 pretty fine, I think.
Yeah.
Thank you.
