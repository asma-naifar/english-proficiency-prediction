. .
I'm fine. ?
.
.
 actually I don't like spring very much because I had the hay fever.
So I'm now suffering the hay fever a lot, so I have to take medicine. . So I don't like spring very much. 
 first, I take medicine and use the mask to prevent the pollen.
. I think that it's a basic way but it's the most effective.
Effective way. Yeah.
 I like movies and listening to music, especially rock music or pop music.
And I also like reading. . Those things I like. And I have a family. And I'm married and I have a daughter, so the spending together with my family is fun.
.
 she is now the seven years old
and she goes to the elementary school. She is now in second grade. . recently, she likes "Harry Potter" Series.
 she's reading the "Harry Potter" in Japanese. Actually, I'm reading
in English version.
 Yeah.
.
 yeah, it's interesting. I like it. And we are competing. 
 My daughter is now reading how can I say, the third issue and I'm in the second issue so she is a bit proud. 

Yeah.
 usually we just spend together and also, sometimes, we go shopping and go hiking and for easy movie like Harry Potter so we go to the movie theater together.
.
 I like the book better.
 because the movies, the time is so limited and in most of the case, the movies version is just going so quickly
and in the books sometimes the expression is more deeper, for example, the in book tells us the feeling of the people.
.
 most favorite movie.
, it's a rather difficult question
but recently I saw a "Apocalypse Now". I liked that very much. .
And yeah, I like movie very much so 
.
.
Yes.
. young girl or young woman sitting in her chair and showing somebody her personal computer. And in her room, there is a cat and dog and the room's door is open and the weather looks nice and time is nine o'clock now. And I don't know what the exact day of the picture. . .
Yes.
, she has her own room.
.
 yeah this rooms looks bigger than my daughter's room. And usually looks more messy.
 the room of the picture is well organized.
 I don't think so.
.
.
 I don't understand what exactly your meaning.
.
 does a bad thing try to lis why she did that and I 'd like to listen her opinion.
 and I always explain why that is a bad thing and I'd like to hear what my daughter thinks about that.
Yes.
.
.
.
.
, I bought a sweater the other day but looks I fitted in my house it doesn't looks very nice, so I'd like to change another sweater. is it possible?
 but actually, I don't like the one I bought, so I don't like to 
wear it. but if you offer another sweater
 I'll wear 
so I think that it's better for your shop or your plan because if I had a good feeling, tol I'd like to tell my friends
my feeling and if you accept exchange, I had a very good impression.
 at your shop so I try to buy another thing. but if you refuse, I'm not very satisfied and I don't like to wear the one I bought, so I think that's is not for both of us.
, yeah.
Yes.
 could you talk to your boss what I was telling you?
And later, and I'd like to have your answer.
.
For one week.
. I can wait.
So, after she's back, so please negotiate with her.
.
Yeah.
 thank you very much.
.
 two important thing. One is the price and one is the product. Quality or the product itself. It looks nice or not and I'd like to try it on. that's what I think.
Yes.
.
Yes.
 this happened last week.
 O K. One day last week, there is a man and women. they were walking in the rain and in the utility pole, there was a box and he heard a sound so the woman likes that dog very much and it looks very pretty, so she would like to bring the dog to their home. they are married so they are living in the same home but the man first refused her idea but he thought again, and after all, they brought back the dog at their home. .
.
.
