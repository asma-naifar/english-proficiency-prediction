My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.<F>Urm</F> you can call me <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.I'm doing great.Yes, I did.<F>Urm</F> could it just be the ones I remember?<F>Urm</F> we had a debate today <SC>at</SC> in class so I had to prepare for that.<F>Urm</F> it was about how you like <?>got</?> marriage <R>whether</R> whether we choose from it outer beauty or inner beauty.<F>Ur</F> personally I'd say it's more about the connection between the two people. But <F>ur</F> <SC>we had to be</SC> we had to say that when we prefer outer beauty.The teacher decide which side you take.Yeah. That's pretty difficult.First grade.<F>Urm</F> it's O K.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> it was one of the only schools <SC>that had</SC> <F>um</F> <R>they</R> they had like English teststo get in. And it was the only school that we are divided into different levels.And I knew <F>urm</F> <?>went to a</?> public schools becausewe couldn't pay forprivate schools.<F>Urm</F> Brazil and France.I can't say.<F>Urm</F> Brazil. <F>Well</F> I'd say it's pretty big country. And <SC>everybody lives</SC> they had their own pace. They live slowly <R>and</R> and gently in there.In <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>.<F>Mm</F> pretty small.I went to an American school.<F>Urm</F> we didn't have uniform.That's about. And my school was from kindergarten to twelfth grade.<F>Urm</F> it's nice. I don't have to think about what I have to wear.But <F>ur</F> it's not nice how I have to wear the same thing everyday.I read.I listen to music.And I play on the computer.<F>Ur</F> mostly science fiction.Or books about <F>urm</F> psychology or <F>um</F> teenage psychology <?>mostly</?>.<F>Ur</F> the one I liked that I read recently was <F>urm</F> "Go Ask Alice".It's the <R>diary</R> diary by anonymous girl.<R>About</R> <R>about</R> <F>ur</F> about a <R>drug</R> drug addict. <CO>She was a good girl first, but <F>urm</F> she got toxicated once and</CO>.<F>Urm</F> it's a math class.And the teacher seems to be teaching very fervently. But <F>ur</F> not that many people are really participating.And there are girls who are doing make-up.Another person who is chewing gum and doesn't seem to care about anything.<F>Urm</F> just one boy in the very front row seems to be paying attention.The girl beside her is fiddling with her cell phone even though she is in the first row.And <F>well</F> actually the boy behindl the participating more seems to be listening. <F>Urr</F> but he's also listening to music and drinkingsome juice.Kind of like this.<??></??><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> depends <R>on</R> on the class but <F>ur</F> <F>um</F> besides English, most classes are like forty people per class. So the teacher can't keep an eye on every student.And so the teacher just teaches what he or she has to teach. And just the students who wanna listen listen, I guess.In my school?<F>Urm</F> O K. <F>Um</F> it's a boy I talk to first when I came to this school.<F>Um</F> he was in the same class. And we met eyes.And we introduced ourselves. And he was <F>ur</F> originally from America.And I was from France.And we talked quite a bit.And then we figured out that we were <F>um</F> taking the same classes.So that's how I got to be good friends with him.<SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> at home, I chat on the Internet.And then <SC>the weekends</SC> on the weekends, I go out to see a movie <??></??>or see concerts.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Um</F> I'm ready.<F>Ah</F> <F>oh</F> <SC?>I have</SC?> I'm supposed to read this?<F>Oh</F> O K. I'm sorry. I'm not ready yet.I'm ready.Hello? <F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I was supposed to go to the party.<OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Oh</F> I am one of the guests.And <nvs>sniff</nvs> <R>I was</R> I was caught up <R>with my</R> with my family. And I couldn't go.It's <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.<OL><??></??></OL>. <nvs>sniff</nvs> I'm sorry <SC>I wa</SC> I didn't go because <nvs>sniff</nvs> my family, <F>well</F> I can't talk about it.But <F>urm</F> we had a problem. <OL><CO>And</CO></OL>.I'll try my best if that's O K with you people.I think I'll be able to make it before you guys are off.<F>Um</F> tell them that I have business to take care of, and that I'll probably will be able to make it before the end of it.Before?From my experience.<F>Ur</F> not that I remember.<F>Ur</F> yes, once.<F>Hm</F>.I asked what was wrong.And I understood that there was some miscommunication between us.<F>Ur</F> first, <R>I ask what happened</R> I ask what happened <R>and</R> <F>ur</F> and then I tell them what was my case.And we try to see what went wrong.O K.O K.One day last week, a mother and her daughter were planning to go camping.And they were excited about it, packing up everything they would need for camp.And they went, set their tent. But <F>ur</F> the weather got bad. It started raining and then storms <?><F>er</F> hit soon</?>. They had to clean up and go right away to somewhere where they could find shelter. And so on their way in the car, they found a hotel. So they were up by hotel and stayed at the hotel instead.Yes.<F>Ur</F> it would be the ski trip for the one time, this winter vacation.<F>Urm</F> my dad wasn't gonna go originally because he had work. But <F>ur</F> my mom wanted the whole family to go.So we went together and we went skiing for <F>ur</F> four days.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Urm</F> my parents <R>made</R> made me follow their ski trips.<F>Um</F> went from since when I was like age four.<OL>And</OL> in France, I went to a ski school.And so and I took up to be the <F>ur</F> highest level classes. <R>So</R>so <F>urm</F> now, we don't have <??></??> classes,but I'm <?>losing</?> what I learned from the classes to ski on my own <??></??> own now.<F>Ur</F> other than skiing, <F>ur</F> sea ormy grandparents' house.In <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL> I also have my grandma in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>.Not really. <SC>That was</SC> <R>I</R> I just stay at their house. I don't <SC>go around</SC> look around the city.<F>Urm</F> <SC>not recent</SC> not lately. I don't go to my grandparents' house. But <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> all I can tell you is that the dialect is different.<R>In</R> intonation is different.And some words are different. But I guess, if they know that we are from <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>, they try to use <SC><H pn="others4">XXX05</H></SC><F>ur</F> standard Japanese. <CO>So</CO>.Yeah. I think French people tend <SC>to speak</SC> <F>urm</F> to pronounce English words in their French pronunciation.So <R>sounds</R> sounds pretty unique. And Brazilians sound like Brazilian people <??></??> <F>Um</F> Brazilian people and Spanish people tend to speak English in the same way, I guess.<F>Urm</F> I was planning to go home and take a nap <OL><?>too</?></OL> because I was very tired.I didn't get any sleep yesterday.And I had <??></??>.<?>Right</?>. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Thank you for the test.
