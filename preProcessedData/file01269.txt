So I've been living in <F>er</F> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> for about five years.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>. And it is nice area. It's very liberal.<OL>You know</OL> it's very wild. <F>Er</F> it's interesting. <SC>It's</SC> so the community is so diverse.<F>Um</F> on <SC>the one side</SC> on the one, <F>um</F> there's a <F>uh</F> intellectual community.On the other hand, <F>ur</F> bunch of homeless people.And also there, the street called <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>,<F>er</F> <R>i</R> it's located just in front of the campus. <?>But</?> however that street is famous for drug dealing.Yeah. So it's a supermarket for drugs. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><?>All right</?>. So yeah, <SC>bunch of different kind</SC> so in a way, you know, bunch of different kinds of people living there. And then also artists are there. And then <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> is famous for <F>er</F> political <F>er</F> <SC>activiti</SC> <SC>ac</SC> you know, activists.So yeah, different kinds of political <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the <?>regime</?>. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F> you can divide it in different categories. So <OL>yeah</OL>.<SC>So it's really</SC> and <R>e</R> ethnically <F>er</F> also it's really interesting place. So it's really diverse.<OL>Almost</OL> you can see <R>any</R> any <F>er</F> ethnic <F>er</F> groupsfrom all over the world.So right. So for example, if you go to <R>coff</R> coffee shop, right? So there you can see different kinds of people <R>in</R> in a <?>big theater</?> and then, you know, Afro Americans there, the Asians there, and then the even among them,are totally different <F>er</F> the ethnicity <??></??>.So in a way, like <F>um</F> it's so hard to categorize like, <R>so</R> so African American which means so many percentage of do you know <F>er</F> there <F>er</F> the black <?>is from</?>.<?>With each</?> category. <F>Er</F> maybe like, you know, <F>er</F> Ghanaian, British, Scottish, <nvs>laughter</nvs> whatever. <OL><laughter>You know</laughter></OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> All right.<H pn="others4">XXX06</H>?<F>Oh</F> one thing is about the school.<OL>Right</OL>.

And then also I'm studying about <F>er</F> medical and policy. I don't know if you're familiar with this. <F>Er</F> but the theme is the medicine. Right. But at the same time, <F>um</F> <SC>study per se</SC> study itself is <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> anthropology.So yeah, studying about social medicine <SC>within <R>the</R> the regime of anthropology</SC> yeah, in the field of anthropology. So yeah, that's a sort of unique subjects. Yeah. So that's the oldest school in the world,this sort of study.<OL>So yeah</OL>. <F>Er</F> so that's why I chose to <OL>live there, yeah</OL>.<CO>So</CO>.Yeah.<OL>Yeah, of course</OL>.One is space. Right.And so living space.<F>Um</F> <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's very wide, open space <OL><?>I think</?></OL>in the States. Especially in the <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>. Right. So but at the same time <SC>if you go t</SC> because of that, right, <SC>so if you</SC> wherever you go, you have to use <F>er</F> automobile.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Or yeah. Or <SC?>mo</SC?> at least you need a bike or something. All right. <F>Um</F> but here, wherever you go, you have to use commuter trains. Right? So that's a huge differences. Of course you know, <R>there</R> <R>there</R> there are some commute trains <R>in</R> in that area. <SC>However</SC> yeah, so here, you know the train system and bus system are really complicated.So <?>you get</?> used to it.

So that was really fun party. So one of the thing is everybody they're connected <F>er</F> through <F>er</F> playing <JP>taiko</JP>.Right. So <F>err</F> in <R>a</R> a <JP>taiko</JP> practice, <F>um</F> <R>we</R> we engaged a lot of our time.So twice or three times a week, <OL>like</OL>.So then <F>er</F> yeah, so <SC>s</SC> you know going through this <F>uh</F> stage, we establish our friendship.And then there, <R>lu</R> luckily, you know, these two <SC>got</SC> they got married and then <SC?>they're</SC?> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> but within five years somebody moved to Portland, Oregon and some other parts of the States.But <F>er</F> this is occasion everybody united.And then <SC?>if</SC?> <R>they</R> <R>they</R> <SC>they pra</SC> they're playing individually, you know.

Like arts are there. Right. So if you really like arts, any kind of arts including painting and music or performing arts, so you know, if you wait for two years, so within two years, one famous musicians, <R>the</R> they all come in to <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>. You only need to wait <R>one or two years</R> one or <R>two</R> two years. So you can't imagine that kind of place in the world. Maybe Tokyo.But Tokyo is little bit too crowded. Right. So it's so hard to get a ticket. But <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>, it's not that crowded. So most likely, you can get tickets to see this, you know, other performers. So that's one thing. Right? <F>Erm</F> also in terms of the sports, also if you want surf, you can surf, although <SC>it's real cold</SC> the water is really cold. But wave is so good. Right? And also there's mountain, <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the place called <H pn="others15">XXX17</H> the <H pn="others15">XXX17</H>. If you go there, you can do any sort of, you know, <F>er</F> sports which means like you can go to skiing, <F>er</F> snowboarding, <F>er</F> you name it. So then there are bunch of hot springs along the <H pn="others16">XXX18</H>, the mountain.And <F>er</F> <?>already</?> you know, <SC>you</SC> there's a <R>casi</R> casino <R>in</R> in <H pn="others17">XXX19</H>. And if you go to <H pn="others18">XXX20</H>, and <H pn="others19">XXX21</H> county, so there are vineyards. So you can enjoy bunch of different kinds of wines. You know the <H pn="others20">XXX22</H> is the best in the world. <nvs>snap</nvs> <OL><nvs>snap</nvs></OL>Yeah. Seriously, yeah. Yeah. <F>Er</F> because the soil and the weather.Yeah. <F>Er</F> the French wine, it's famous because of their marketing, you know. Right. But in terms of quality, the <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> is best. We are so spoiled. Yeah.So even the supermarket, we can get wine, but it's really, really good wine. Yeah.So yeah. <F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F> so <SC>y</SC> <SC>after you live in</SC> <F>uh</F> you know, after you live in <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> <F>er</F> I don't know, <F>er</F> how much you can enjoy wine in Japan. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><laughter>All right, yeah</laughter></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>All right. So yeah.<CO><R>Ye</R> yeah so</CO>. And then in terms of foods, <F>er</F> as you know, there are bunch of different community in <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>. If you go to, say even in <H pn="others10">XXX12</H> you can go to <H pn="others19">XXX21</H>, <F>er</F> there is an Italian community. <?>All right</?>, so also like in China Town, also Japan town, you know, <F>er</F> some other Latino people doing some other sort of things. So each area, <R>you can</R> you can enjoy different kind of food.<OL>So which</OL> means <SC>e</SC> living there means you can enjoy the world from all the world.Yeah.Right. Right. <??></??> is here, right? So <SC>it's</SC> <F>uh</F> in a way it's a cosmopolitan, <OL>right</OL>,the Tokyo is. However one of the <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>er</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> problem is <F>urm</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> cost. You know <??></??> like an accessibility. <OL>Right</OL>.So the other day, I went to Chinese food restaurant. <?>Like you know</?> each plate is <?>better</?>. <OL><??></??></OL> The cost is one thousand yen per plate. <laughter>So it's so expensive</laughter>.<F>Ur</F> So you can't afford to pay. All right. All right. Versus <H pn="others14">XXX16</H>, all right so even <F>er</F> for students, <R>it's</R> it's O K, like you know, all right, overnight, I spend only twenty or thirty buck a night. But <R>I</R> I can enjoy it.<OL>But</OL> here, like a hundred <OL>buck a night</OL>.<OL>But still</OL> it's not that enough. <OL>So</OL>yeah, it's so hard.

And the guy was with <SC>cellar phone</SC> cellphone <F>er</F> talking to <F>er</F> his girlfriend, it seems. <F>Er</F>. And then <F>er</F> yeah, <F>er</F> the traffic accident occurred. <F>Urm</F> the car hits <R>the</R> the scooter. And <F>er</F> then the guy in scooter, <F>er</F> he blamed <F>er</F> to <R>the</R> the car driver <F>er</F> although <F>er</F> it seems it's <SC>his</SC> probably his mistake <?>of</?> cellphone. He was claiming <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the cellphone was destroyed. Right. So then police came. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Still they are talking about cellphone rather than accident, <laughter><?>see</?></laughter>. Yeah. Then <F>er</F> yeah, <F>er</F> they're reporting. <F>Er</F> also the guy, the <SC>driver</SC> car driver <F>er</F> is <F>er</F> explaining about cellphone.
