 yeah, I don't know much about . Yeah. Usually use that station, Station.
 you know, commuting purpose. So 
. So, yeah, I can see like, you know, the Daiei
 I can see some other supermarket
 book shops, that.
.
yeah, and then also I'm living little away from the station. So it takes, how many minutes, about five minutes bike.
So yeah.
Is it ?
 I think so.
. It's relatively convenient.
 it's a nice location, though, my apartment. it was the , right? To and then some other station called .

So yeah, and I can use both stations.
Before?
 , .
. , . .
?
 I'm a graduate student over there. So I've been living in for about five years.
. And it is nice area. It's very liberal.
 it's very wild. it's interesting. so the community is so diverse.
 on on the one, there's a intellectual community.
On the other hand, bunch of homeless people.
And also there, the street called ,
 it's located just in front of the campus. however that street is famous for drug dealing.
Yeah. So it's a supermarket for drugs. 
. So yeah, so in a way, you know, bunch of different kinds of people living there. And then also artists are there. And then is famous for political you know, activists.
So yeah, different kinds of political the . you can divide it in different categories. So .
 and ethnically also it's really interesting place. So it's really diverse.
 you can see any ethnic groups
from all over the world.
So right. So for example, if you go to coffee shop, right? So there you can see different kinds of people in a and then, you know, Afro Americans there, the Asians there, and then the even among them,
are totally different the ethnicity .
So in a way, like it's so hard to categorize like, so African American which means so many percentage of do you know there the black .
 category. maybe like, you know, Ghanaian, British, Scottish, whatever. .
 All right.
?
 one thing is about the school.
. So yeah. I like the school.
. I know it's very, very liberal school. And then I'm studying about Japan.
So in terms of Japan studies, one of best school. And then also I'm studying about medical and policy. I don't know if you're familiar with this. but the theme is the medicine. Right. But at the same time, study itself is anthropology.
So yeah, studying about social medicine the regime of anthropology yeah, in the field of anthropology. So yeah, that's a sort of unique subjects. Yeah. So that's the oldest school in the world,
this sort of study.
. so that's why I chose to .
.
Yeah.
.
One is space. Right.
And so living space.
 it's very wide, open space 
in the States. Especially in the . Right. So but at the same time because of that, right, wherever you go, you have to use automobile.
. Or yeah. Or at least you need a bike or something. All right. but here, wherever you go, you have to use commuter trains. Right? So that's a huge differences. Of course you know, there are some commute trains in that area. yeah, so here, you know the train system and bus system are really complicated.
So used to it. And then you know for me, this is the first time to live in .
So I have to know everything.
.
 so yeah, so that's why, you know you know what's going on in , it's so hard to say, " .
.

 times.
O K.
 skiing place, obviously. I can see a lift. And I can see people are skiing and snowboarding. it's hard to describe it. Yeah. So I don't know. So this guy is playing with snow. And I think they stop. and so this guy's flipped over. So then only kids I can see in this pictures. So their the clothes are very bright. You know, the skis are also bright colors.

Just for or something.
But since then, my view on has totally changed. . This is a musical instrument. And they're so serious. And then this Kodo, you know, this group, you know about the Kodo, they travel all the world to play for about hundred days a year. they play outside of Japan.
And the other hundred days, stay in Japan and then playing over Japan.
And the other hundred days they practice. All right. to play their new music .
Yeah. And then I move to the States nine or ten years ago. Then as I told you, like in last five years or so I lived in . So then I can see them as as the local people. I can see in . And then the guy called who brought the from , he also establish his own group there for the .
So yeah, that's one of the main group in the States. So I join them. this is cool.
Yeah. .
No.
 yeah.
 yeah then since I came back here,
in , there's a group called . I join this group.
. And I've been practicing with them. so
 it's fun.

.
.
O K.

.
. .
Bye.
.
.
Party?
 yeah one is my friend wedding.
You know wedding party. both of them are player.
So and then, you know, many of their guests are players
 and some other musicians. So that was really fun party. So one of the thing is everybody they're connected through playing .
Right. So in a practice, we engaged a lot of our time.
So twice or three times a week, .
So then yeah, so you know going through this stage, we establish our friendship.
And then there, luckily, you know, these two they got married and then but within five years somebody moved to Portland, Oregon and some other parts of the States.
But this is occasion everybody united.
And then they're playing individually, you know. They're playing a different groups .
However they get together, we jam together 
playing together. 
The wedding, you know, ceremony. That was really amazing. 
yeah we were so connected.
.
.
 activities? .
 yeah in a way, like the is one of the area people who are living there, they are very spoiled.
Yeah, because you can do anything. Like arts are there. Right. So if you really like arts, any kind of arts including painting and music or performing arts, so you know, if you wait for two years, so within two years, one famous musicians, they all come in to . You only need to wait one or two years. So you can't imagine that kind of place in the world. Maybe Tokyo.
But Tokyo is little bit too crowded. Right. So it's so hard to get a ticket. But , it's not that crowded. So most likely, you can get tickets to see this, you know, other performers. So that's one thing. Right? also in terms of the sports, also if you want surf, you can surf, although the water is really cold. But wave is so good. Right? And also there's mountain, the place called the . If you go there, you can do any sort of, you know, sports which means like you can go to skiing, snowboarding, you name it. So then there are bunch of hot springs along the , the mountain.
And you know, there's a casino in . And if you go to , and county, so there are vineyards. So you can enjoy bunch of different kinds of wines. You know the is the best in the world. 
Yeah. Seriously, yeah. Yeah. because the soil and the weather.
Yeah. the French wine, it's famous because of their marketing, you know. Right. But in terms of quality, the is best. We are so spoiled. Yeah.
So even the supermarket, we can get wine, but it's really, really good wine. Yeah.
So yeah. so you know, after you live in I don't know, how much you can enjoy wine in Japan. 

All right. So yeah.
 yeah so as you know, there are bunch of different community in . If you go to, say even in you can go to , there is an Italian community. , so also like in China Town, also Japan town, you know, some other Latino people doing some other sort of things. So each area, you can enjoy different kind of food.
 means living there means you can enjoy the world from all the world.
Yeah.
Right. Right. in a way it's a cosmopolitan, ,
the Tokyo is. However one of the problem is cost. You know .
So the other day, I went to Chinese food restaurant. each plate is . .
 So you can't afford to pay. All right. All right. Versus , all right so even for students, it's O K, like you know, all right, overnight, I spend only twenty or thirty buck a night. But I can enjoy it.
 here, like a hundred .
 it's not that enough. 
yeah, it's so hard. Yeah.
Yeah. .
.
.
 That's .
 O K.
So yeah, one day last week, a guy who drived a car really fast. Then a scooter, yeah, are coming from the direction where he's going. And the guy was with cellphone talking to his girlfriend, it seems. . And then yeah, the traffic accident occurred. the car hits the scooter. And then the guy in scooter, he blamed to the car driver although it seems it's probably his mistake cellphone. He was claiming the cellphone was destroyed. Right. So then police came. Still they are talking about cellphone rather than accident, yeah, they're reporting. also the guy, the car driver is explaining about cellphone. Then the pick-up came. And it picked the scooter up. Yeah. And that's it.
.
.
.
 no problem.
.
.
. Thank you .
