No, I only travel but I join some international program, so I have some friends in abroad. but I never study in abroad.
 in English almost all my friend is not native English people, some Italian or Singapore, Philippina or Indonesia. So we are not native. our first language not English. So I can try. It's easy than speak American or British, I think.

. O K. . one day last week, she went to the one department. it's not near her house. so her heart is very excited then. . her wanted to buy no, no, necktie is O K? wanted to buy necktie for her husband. his birthday is this week. So she wanted to buy some good necktie for him. she ask the employee who worked in the department store. and he recognized her green and yellows marked pointed neckties. she liked that necktie, so she bought it. after she bought the necktie, many discounted sales goods. It's shoes or wear or everything are discounted. So at first, she didn't think she will buy other thing, except for a present for her husband. But not sorry, after no, she looked some beautiful and very good things, she wanted to buy them. So she bought shoes and dresses and many goods in this department store. And after she is gone back to her home, very satisfied it her heart. . That's all.
 I like to Shinjuku or Shibuya. because in department store, many people are moving. And I don't like so many crowded place. But many people excited make my hart excited. So I like go there and but . but we can touch the trend and popular goods.
.
. for example, the clothes and dresses, really exactly I will wear that clothes. , if I like this wear very much, but I would never wear that clothes because it's not chance are good for maybe I will don't have the chance wear that clothes. it's good design but not good for the usually life, normally life.
 so when I choose the clothes, I think it's most important is , this clothes is suitable my life.
 
.
 now, I go back to my school and study, and I'm go on my study. .
 to graduate university.
 you're welcome. Thank you very much.
