So, inside of the train has a little bit,  how do you say, continental or  yeah, colonial  mood.   but it's only two trains  at evening,  so five o'clock, no, four o'clock  and five o'clock.    two trains.  and  we can enjoy   the scene  where the sun is sitting down.   some  wild animals  we can see. It was very fun. Fantastic, yes.
