My name is <F>ee</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yeah.<F>Ah</F>. Fine, thank you. How about you?<.></.> For job?<F>Um</F>. Now, I belongs to the formulations production scheduling sections.<F>Uh</F>. So I am in charge of <F>uh</F> section manager, so I <R>co</R> collaborate with my colleagues <F>uh</F> one guys and two ladies. And, everyday, <F>uh</F> they managed about <?>toll</?> manufacturing. Do you understand <??></??> <?>toll</?>?We have the facility to produce our product, <?>pesticide</?> product, but the <F>uh</F> our production site is not able to cover all production.We have the variety of the <?>pesticide</?> product, one of the solid, other is a liquid. But <F>uh</F> <.></.> some of the product are not able to produce <F>um</F> in-house, so, <F>er</F> every day, now colleagues managed to the other <?>pesticide</?> company to ask to produce our product.Yeah, but, <F>er</F> former time, I belong to the factory site, so <SC>we</SC> it is a, <F>eh</F> <.></.> what can I say, <F>er</F> <?>even now</?>, to concentrate our production at factory. But, now, we think about <F>uh</F> our own factory production schedule and also other <?>toll</?> formulation <?>schedule</?>. So it is rather complicated <R>and the</R> <R>and the</R> and, the former time, <SC>we <SC>can't</SC> don't</SC> I don't have the contact with other department, for example, the sales department. But, now, we sitting on the head office, so we surrounded sales department people. So, <.></.> often, they came to, and "Would you please to change the amount of production for this month or next month?". So, every day, changing the production schedule. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>Yeah. <F>Um</F>. I like <F>um</F> music. <F>Er</F>. <SC>Former</SC> in our university days, we belong to the <F>er</F> folk song club.<OL>I played</OL> guitar, <F>er</F> but, after graduated, <F>er</F> there are no chance to play the guitar because <F>er</F> we need <F>uh</F> groups.I played guitar, so we need <F>uh</F> bass or drums or vocals or keyboard. <CO>But <F>er</F> it's a difficult to</CO>. And, of course, I played guitar at <F>uh</F> rural place. <F>Uh</F>. My hometown is Yamaguchi, so <??></??> skill level of <SC>a player</SC> <SC>amateur level</SC> amateur play is not so high compared with a Tokyo.Or big cities. So <F>uh</F> <SC>it's a very</SC> <.></.> I hated to play with <OL>other amateur players</OL> in this areas.Yeah. It's a depend on the population, I think.Many many young guys plays the guitar and piano, so, <SC>some of the</SC> maybe, ratio is not so <R>dif</R> different from the <F>um</F> rural area and big cities. But, <F>er</F> how can I say, volume of <R>po</R> population is completely different. So <SC>top skill player</SC> the <SC>ma</SC> number of top <R>skill</R> skill <SC>players</SC> amateur players is a bigger than <?>other</?> small towns.Yes. <F>Um</F>. This shows a class, maybe, junior high school or high school. Now, <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the lady teacher <F>um</F> teaching about mathematics and <SC>draw</SC> draw down <F>eh</F> graphs. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> but <F>uh</F> some of students are not concentrate to <SC>the</SC> this <SC>class</SC> studies. Some of this, <F>oh</F> <.></.> he is <R>same</R> same hobby <OL><?>as me</?></OL>Listening <F>er</F> the music some and the <?>sn</?>, yeah. <..></..> Yeah.Yeah, and <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> there's a little bit different from the Japanese <F>er</F> school, because I think <F>er</F> some ladies wears tank tops but others <F>er</F> <F>er</F> traditional Japanese sailer <.></.> clothes. <.></.> <F>Uh</F>. And, in Japan, maybe, beside of the <F>um</F> private school, <SC?>public school did</SC?> <F>er</F> school force to student to wear the uniform clothes, so is a lot different from those <F>um</F> public Japanese schools. <.></.> And also, <.></.> maybe, <SC>it's</SC> <F>um</F> yeah, first I saw this and she calculated with electric calculator, but <F>uh</F> not calculator, it's a handy phone. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Um</F>. Yeah. <.></.> So, when I was a junior high school or high school students, at that time, uniform is a better for <.></.> me because <SC>don't</SC> it's not necessary to care about today which clothes I want to put on or something. But, <F>um</F> nowadays, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> how can I say, philosophy of <?>all</?> the personality is gradually changing. So I am rather older <F>er</F> generation, so <SC>I don't think</SC> I didn't think about <F>uh</F> <R>difference</R> <SC>difference</SC> different <SC>popularities more</SC> <F>um</F> personalities more, how can I say, <.></.> <F>um</F> <..></..> people think about more seriously about personality, but, <F>er</F> former time, <SC>not so think about</SC> <SC>don't</SC> didn't think about. So, now, all of the people think <F>er</F> personalities are main point. <CO>So I think it's not</CO>. <F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F>. Recent trend to changing <?>the</?> <R>ru</R> rule of a school to wear <SC>which kind of</SC> which kind clothes, what do you want is a good situation, I think.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yeah.Yeah, I bought this goods <F>um</F> today, but, <F>um</F> after I went back to my home, I opened the package. So, yeah, maybe, <F>um</F> how can I say, when I saw this <R>go</R> goods at the this department, is a very nice for me. But, <F>uh</F> in a home, I opened the packages, the, how can I say, colors something different <SC>my</SC> from my image. Maybe, it cause by the, how can I say, decoration light or, department stores <F>uh</F> <F>ee</F> <F>er</F> installed the special lights so make the color more vivid or something. So, <F>uh</F> would you please change <SC>other clothes</SC> other colors, yeah?Yeah, but, <F>um</F> <SC>the time</SC> yeah, <SC>I thought</SC> <F>um</F> I think it was better for me to check also this <F>er</F> down light for this clothes lamp, and also, this brought to <R>the</R> the window side to check <SC>the</SC> under the sunlight, but <F>uh</F> <SC>there</SC> it was my fault. But <F>uh</F> I hesitate <SC>to do</SC> to that. This situation is not polite to go this departments.O K. So <.></.> I'll look around other corners, so, would you please negotiate your manager? So I go back <F>uh</F> <R>two</R> two hours later. <CO>So</CO>.Yeah.<OL>Yeah</OL>. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.<F>Um</F>. Yes. <F>Er</F>. <SC>First our</SC> first my <F>er</F> overseas trip, at that time, I forgot <F>er</F> to <R>bro</R> brought my <F>um</F> underwears, not <.></.> <SC>we</SC> I checked numbers but is not so enough for me. So, before I went to overseas, I thought <.></.> is O K to clean or wash myself or something, but <F>um</F> is a very, how can I say, hard to me because <F>uh</F> very delinquent personality. So, finally, I <SC>s</SC> <SC>asked my</SC> <SC>ask</SC> asked the hotel managers, and <F>uh</F> <??></??> <SC>they informed me</SC> they <?>taught</?> me to the department stores. But <F>uh</F> foreigner is a very big.So <R>I</R> I asked <SC>calan</SC> clerk, so, Would you <R>please</R> <F>er</F> please <SC>info</SC> <F>er</F> tell me the which corner is a better to find <F>er</F> my underwear?" or something. "You should go to the children's <OL><??></??></OL>.".<laughter>Yes</laughter>.<laughter>Yes</laughter>.<F>Umm</F>.O K.One day last week, <..></..> <SC>in the coincidence with</SC> <F>m</F> with some <R>coi</R> coincidence, we met my uncle <.></.> and just front of a restaurant. It's a very nice situation, so I asked uncle <?>were</?> hungry. So, <.></.> "Would you, <F>uh</F> how can I say, <R>try</R> <F>m</F> try to take <F>er</F> dinner?". So, very kindly, <F>o</F> invited me to the <SC>restaurant</SC> near restaurant. And I order the beers and a meat, a lot of beers, so <R>I</R> I satisfied. <SC>So</SC> and <F>uh</F> my uncle is very kind person. She paid all of the <?>charge</?>, <SC>so</SC> and <SC>I asked</SC> <SC>I said <?>this</?></SC> <F>er</F> I said thank you very much to the uncle <SC>so</SC> <.></.> and <SC>good-bye</SC> say good-bye.Eat out?No. <..></..> I like the Japanese style, <SC>so</SC> and <R>I</R> I've went to the overseas twice as a business trip.

So, <.></.> every time I, how I can say, think about my capacities and which kind of dishes are waiting or something.Yeah, <.></.> generally, my upper manager, <SC>is</SC> <F>uh</F> often they went to the overseas, so, before I went to the Germany, <SC>the</SC> my managers recommended, "After one week, <SC>you <.></.> eager to</SC> maybe, you eager to eat Japanese dishes, so this place <F>uh</F> there are very famous Japanese restaurant and there <OL><??></??></OL>.".Yeah, after this, <F>er</F> <SC?>we has</SC?> I have a special meeting with our department for the new personal management system.Thank you.
