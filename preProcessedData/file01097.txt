I live in just close to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Station. Ten minutes walk.I don't think so<OL>because</OL> too busy place to live in, I think. Very convenient, but a lot of drunker. <nvs>laughter</nvs><SC>Like</SC> how can I say, like traditional town <SC>walking</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>old</R> old lady's walking like, how can I say, and <F>mm</F> <OL><R>morning</R></OL> morning market.<OL><F>Uum</F></OL> I mean just I want to live with <F>ur</F> how can I say, <R>na</R> natural living like, <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City is very brand new, very changing every time. And <F>er</F> almost all shops are focussing on young people. So we can't see any old people there.It's very <SC>weird</SC> strange for me.<OL><??></??></OL> sometimes uncomfortable. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.O K. <F>Mhm</F> I have only child, and <??></??> <SC>I live in my mother</SC> I live in with my mother and father and me. And <R>my</R> <.></.> my father is working for the company dealing with Japanese traditional pictures, vases, traditional products. And he is the president of that company, working very hard, I think. And my mother, she also has a job, and <F>ur</F> she is <F>ur</F> public servant working for <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.Yeah, of course.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mhm</F> in what way? <SC>He's</SC> he seems very professional for his job. And <F>ur</F> he is very good at with me and with my mother, too. So maybe his sense of balance, job and family is very good, I think.<F>Mm-hm</F>.O K. It's the picture of the class. And <F>ur</F> the <SC>lady</SC> woman teacher is teaching mathematics, I think. And <F>ur</F> <SC>students</SC> <.></.> there're some students on the picture, <SC>and</SC> but almost all of them are not caring for the teacher. Just one boy student's listening carefully and taking the notes. But the speaking of others, they're like just talking <R>with</R> with their friends, and drinking something, and listening music, and e-mailing by cell phone something like that. <R>It's</R> it's not good class, it seems. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>It's like</SC> <F>ur</F> maybe it's class of junior high school, but they don't wear the uniforms. <?>That's all</?>.Yeah,I was.What do you mean? <CO><OL>Which</OL></CO>?Casual and uniform?<F>Mhm</F> I think it's good to wear uniforms because I don't need to care about <laughter>the clothes</laughter>. Because when I was junior high, I don't have enough money to select clothes so uniform maybe help me a lot.Yes.<OL>Easier <??></??></OL>.<F>Mhm</F>. It depends because <F>mm</F> in my junior high school days, <F>urm</F> I have some special <SC>system</SC> school system in my school. It's like I don't have home class. <F>Mhm</F> instead, <F>ur</F> <SC>I had like</SC> <F>ur</F> I had class selected by the ability. Like I have English class and mathematics class, something like that. And each class is the different. Its teachers are different, and its each classmate are different. So it depends. So like very boring class, it was almost same as this picture. But sometimes <R>very</R> <R>very</R> very strict teacher, we were listening to the strict teacher. So it <??></??> depends. Yeah.<F>Mhm</F> I think teacher is not so good maybe. It seems she's speaking to the black board, not speaking <SC>to the</SC> to students. So she has some problems, too, I think.Read in English?Japanese?<CO>Invitation is</CO>.<??></??>.O K.Hello, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Hi. <F>Urm</F> I'm talking about the dinner party that <F>urm</F> I was supposed to go there, but I didn't go.

And <R>I</R> <SC>I got</SC> <R>I</R> I went to the place <SC>that she had a</SC> where she had a car accident, and I took her to the hospital, too. So <R>I</R> I couldn't even <F>ur</F> tell you that I can't go there.Yeah. I'm so sorry, but I was so upset, you know. It was so, how can I say, it was very unspecial <SC>un</SC> that <R>I</R> I couldn't expected. I was so upset so I just forgot about the party. Not forgot, like <R>I</R> I couldn't have a space in my mind.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yeah, right. So yeah, that's why I'm apologizing today. Yeah, I'm so sorry. <R>I</R> I really want to go there, but I couldn't. <SC>I just</SC> I want to go there in the next time for sure. Yeah.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Thank you.Have you ever heard <R>from</R> <OL>from my friend</OL>?<F>Oh</F> did Iexperienced?

But <R>I</R> I got <F>ur</F> too much drink on Friday with my colleagues, and I couldn't <R>go</R> go back to home on Friday. <laughter>I just</laughter> stayed <R>at my</R> at my friend's <R>ho</R> hotel, and I got up afternoon. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So and I had a heavy <F>urm</F> headache on Saturday so I just couldn't go to have a dinner with my girlfriend on Saturday night.<nvs>laughter</nvs> She said like, "It's O K. <R>Let's</R> let's have a meet on Sunday." when <SC>I apologize</SC> I excused.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm</F>. O K. <CO>So I need to explain the</CO>.<F>Oh</F>. O K. <..></..> <F>Mm</F>. Should I start?One day last week, <F>mhm</F> I was walking with my girlfriend. <R>It was rainy day</R> it was rainy day. And suddenly, I just heard <F>urm</F> strange <SC>voices</SC> voice <SC>like <F>mhm</F> the</SC> like cat, I think. But it was very small voices so my girlfriend didn't recognize it. And I just look around it, and found a box. And inside the box, <F>urm</F> there was a small cat inside. And she was so cute. And my girlfriend also <R>liked</R> <R>liked the</R> <SC>liked the cat</SC> liked her. And my girlfriend pick up the cat, and asked to me to bring the cat to our house. We are living together. But I said I can't do that because we are living in the apartment. The owner of the apartment <R>will</R> will not allow us to have a pet. But <SC>she</SC> my girlfriend is really wanted to <F>urm</F> <SC>have a</SC> have that cat. She was really liked her. <F>Mhm</F> she couldn't stop <R>to</R> to hope it. So <.></.> I was just thinking, and <SC>I just</SC> <F>um</F> she said <R>she</R> she will take care of that cat all time by herself. So I just decided to take the cat to the home, and live together. All of <??></??>. Yeah.<F>Mhm</F> boyfriend and girlfriend.Lovers, but not <F>ur</F> wife and husband. Like living before the marriage. Very close. But not married.<F>Urrr</F> you know, I like the cat very much. And <F>ur</F> <.></.> I really want to have a pet, but because I live in the apartment so <R>I</R> <SC>I can't take it to the cat</SC> I can't take the cat to the home. So maybe I will <SC>call some</SC> call to some friends of mine, and like if they have a space to have a pet. And <R>even</R> <R>even</R> even though I couldn't find the friends, <R>I</R> I just need to leave her there, I think.<F>Mhm</F> not guilty because <SC>I don't have</SC> <F>ur</F> I can't afford to do it. I'm not the person who care the cat. Maybe she will be not happy when I take it to home.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Yeah. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Kind of.But I can do that maybe.Yeah. Good colleagues.Thank you.<OL>Thank you, too</OL>.
