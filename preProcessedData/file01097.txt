Good morning.
Yeah. My name is .
Nice to meet you, too. Thank you.
 pretty good because Monday morning, I got enough sleep last night.
Yeah. 
Much better than other days,
I think.
Yeah.
 also Fridays.

Yeah.
 so far so good because almost all colleagues are smart, exciting. and I like about my project I'm doing right now.
 smart means how can I say, impressive, or I can take project smoothly.
. ?
I'm from City. I live in just close to Station. Ten minutes walk.
I don't think so
 too busy place to live in, I think. Very convenient, but a lot of drunker. 
 how can I say, like traditional town old lady's walking like, how can I say, and morning market.
 how can I say, natural living like, City is very brand new, very changing every time. And almost all shops are focussing on young people. So we can't see any old people there.
It's very strange for me.

Yeah.
O K. I have only child, and I live in with my mother and father and me. And she is public servant working for City.
Yeah, of course.

 in what way? he seems very professional for his job. And he is very good at with me and with my mother, too. So maybe his sense of balance, job and family is very good, I think.
.
O K. It's the picture of the class. And the woman teacher is teaching mathematics, I think. And but almost all of them are not caring for the teacher. Just one boy student's listening carefully and taking the notes. But the speaking of others, they're like just talking with their friends, and drinking something, and listening music, and e-mailing by cell phone something like that. it's not good class, it seems. maybe it's class of junior high school, but they don't wear the uniforms. .
Yeah,
I was.
What do you mean? ?
Casual and uniform?
 I think it's good to wear uniforms because I don't need to care about . Because when I was junior high, I don't have enough money to select clothes so uniform maybe help me a lot.
Yes.
.
. It depends because in my junior high school days, I have some special school system in my school. It's like I don't have home class. instead, I had class selected by the ability. Like I have English class and mathematics class, something like that. And each class is the different. Its teachers are different, and its each classmate are different. So it depends. So like very boring class, it was almost same as this picture. But sometimes very strict teacher, we were listening to the strict teacher. So it depends. Yeah.
 I think teacher is not so good maybe. It seems she's speaking to the black board, not speaking to students. So she has some problems, too, I think.
Read in English?
Japanese?
.
.
O K.
Hello, this is .
Hi. I'm talking about the dinner party that I was supposed to go there, but I didn't go. And I would like to apologize about it. . on that day, I was just called suddenly by my very best friends. Like she had a car accident, and she didn't know how to deal with it. So she was calling from her cell phone to me. And I just called to one one nine, and call the how can I say, emergency car. And I went to the place where she had a car accident, and I took her to the hospital, too. So I couldn't even tell you that I can't go there.
Yeah. I'm so sorry, but I was so upset, you know. It was so, how can I say, it was very unspecial that I couldn't expected. I was so upset so I just forgot about the party. Not forgot, like I couldn't have a space in my mind.
.
Yeah, right. So yeah, that's why I'm apologizing today. Yeah, I'm so sorry. I really want to go there, but I couldn't. I want to go there in the next time for sure. Yeah.
.
Thank you.
Have you ever heard ?
 did I
experienced? No. Not at all.
Yeah.
 yeah. on the last Friday, I just made a phone call to my girlfriend, and like "Yeah, it's just Friday, and let's have a dinner tomorrow like Saturday night.". But I got too much drink on Friday with my colleagues, and I couldn't go back to home on Friday. stayed at my friend's hotel, and I got up afternoon. So and I had a heavy headache on Saturday so I just couldn't go to have a dinner with my girlfriend on Saturday night.
 She said like, "It's O K. let's have a meet on Sunday." when I excused.
.

.
. O K. .
. O K. . Should I start?
One day last week, I was walking with my girlfriend. it was rainy day. And suddenly, I just heard strange voice the there was a small cat inside. And she was so cute. And my girlfriend also liked her. And my girlfriend pick up the cat, and asked to me to bring the cat to our house. We are living together. But I said I can't do that because we are living in the apartment. The owner of the apartment will not allow us to have a pet. But my girlfriend is really wanted to have that cat. She was really liked her. she couldn't stop to hope it. So she said she will take care of that cat all time by herself. So I just decided to take the cat to the home, and live together. All of . Yeah.
 boyfriend and girlfriend.
Lovers, but not wife and husband. Like living before the marriage. Very close. But not married.
 you know, I like the cat very much. And I can't take the cat to the home. So maybe I will call to some friends of mine, and like if they have a space to have a pet. And even though I couldn't find the friends, I just need to leave her there, I think.
 not guilty because I can't afford to do it. I'm not the person who care the cat. Maybe she will be not happy when I take it to home.
.
Yeah. 
Kind of.
But I can do that maybe.
Yeah. Good colleagues.
Thank you.
.
