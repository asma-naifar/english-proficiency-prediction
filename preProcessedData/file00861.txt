Not much anymore. <SC>When I was</SC> <F>ah</F>, you know, <.></.> when I was a <R>chil</R> child, I played with them, but <F>ah</F> not anymore.Just, you know, <.></.> <R>we</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> we talk usual things, you know?Yes.<F>Ahm</F>. <.></.> <R>Yes and no</R> <.></.> yes and no. <SC>It</SC> the town is very small and still quiet, but <F>ahh</F> <.></.> getting busy.<F>Ah</F> a woman is sitting in front of a computer. And, next of the computer, there is an typewriter on the desk. <.></.> So <.></.> two domestic <R>animals</R> animals are there. One is a cat and the other <SC>is a dog</SC> is dog. <.></.> <F>Ahh</F> <.></.> there is a <.></.> bed in this room. <.></.> And also, I can see a <.></.> <F>ahm</F> <.></.> calendar on the wall in June.<F>Mm-hum</F> <F>ah</F>. <..></..> O K. <F>Ah</F>. <.></.> <R>First</R> first <?>of all</?>, I was a student, I <SC>si</SC> have a room, but the room was smaller than this room. And <.></.> I used a <F>er</F> <JP>futon</JP> instead of bed. And I didn't have computer nor a typewriter. <.></.> I had a <.></.> dog but not a cat. And <..></..> I kept the dog outside, but not in my room. <.></.> <F>Ah</F> it looks this room is better than I used to have.Dog? <F>Ah</F> <..></..> you mean, a dog I had<OL>or</OL><OL>dog itself</OL> or?<F>Ah</F> O K. The dog was white and <.></.> bigger than myself.Because, <F>ah</F> <.></.> actually my family kept the dog, and the dog was older than I.<CO>So <R>when I</R> <.></.> <F>ah</F> <..></..> when I live</CO>. <F>Ah</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>er</F> <..></..> I think the dog <.></.> thought he is a <.></.> member of our family. And <F>ah</F> I guess the dog thought <.></.> he is <SC>a</SC> <F>ah</F> older and senior than myself. <.></.> So he didn't pay any respect to me. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Mm-hum</F></OL>.O K.<OL><F>Mm-hum</F></OL>.<F>Ah</F> yes. <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> I reserved a <F>ah</F> seat, but <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> I delayed the train. So I want to change this train ticket.So, <R>can you</R> <F>ah</F> <..></..> <R>can you</R> <.></.> <SC>ei</SC> <F>ah</F> can you exchange this to a <F>ah</F> money, or <.></.> I want to <SC>ei</SC> <F>ah</F> get another train.<F>Uhu</F>.O K. <F>Ah</F>. <..></..> So, <F>ah</F> <..></..> can I get normal train?

And <F>ah</F> <.></.> I guess it's not my fault. And <F>ah</F> <..></..> I think you should pay a refund. Or, <.></.> <F>ah</F> you know, exchange this ticket to another one.Yes.<F>Ah</F> I guess so. I cannot tell exact reason right now, but <F>ah</F> <.></.> there was a heavy traffic jam. It's not normal.<OL>O K</OL>. But <F>ah</F> I'm rather <R>in</R> <.></.> in hurry. <CO>So, <OL>can you</OL></CO>?O K. <OL>Sure</OL>.<OL>Thank you</OL>.No.Once or <R>twice</R> twice a year.<F>Ahhh</F> <F>mm</F>. U S because I don't know much about the other countries. SoI stayed there for four months, and <.></.> it is the place I only know.I mean, other than Japan.Special?<F>Ahhh</F>. <.></.> <CO>It is</CO>. <F>Ah</F>. O K. I only know about New York area.And <F>ah</F> <.></.> it is said <R>it</R> <R>it is</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.> it is the <F>ah</F> melting spot. I see <F>ah</F> many people <.></.> there. <.></.> White, Black, Asian. <SC>And</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>so</R> <.></.> so it's very <F>er</F> different from Japan. And I feel, you know, energy from them.<OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>It's very</OL> difficult to <R>organize</R> <.></.> organize, you know, <R>one</R> <.></.> one unit or one organization. So, you know, for example, you know, <.></.> <R>Pres</R> President Bush needs always to show, you know, U S is very good and very powerful to gather their attention <.></.> to make it one, <.></.> I think.<OL>O K</OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> O K.<F>Ah-huh</F>.<.></.> Last week, I was driving a car <.></.> to go to the office. And <F>ah</F> <.></.> I saw a man was riding on a bicycle, <.></.> using <F>er</F> mobile phone. <.></.> I thought he was calling to <.></.> his girlfriend. <..></..> And, <F>ah</F> suddenly, he made a <F>eh</F> <..></..> left turn, and <.></.> <SC>I was</SC> <..></..> <R>I</R> <F>eh</F> <.></.> I almost hit him. <.></.> And he dropped his mobile phone, and it was broken. <..></..> No, actually, there was an <F>ah</F> accident. <.></.> And he complained about <.></.> <SC>a</SC> <F>ah</F> <.></.> the damage of his <F>er</F> motorcycle and also mobile phone. <.></.> And I called a <F>ah</F> police <..></..> and also <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>eh</F> car repair shop. And, <F>ah</F> <..></..> one hour later, car repair shop man <.></.> came and <F>ah</F> <.></.> brought his <SC>mobile</SC> <F>er</F> motorcycle.Strange story. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.Heavy traffic jam? One reason maybe is that <.></.> taxi drivers do not know about New York. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Because</OL> I heard <F>er</F> that <..></..> taxi driver is not <F>ah</F> <.></.> a <F>ah</F> <.></.> job which is respected. Many immigrant come <.></.> to New York, and <F>ah</F> one of the fast jobs they get is <.></.> <F>eh</F> taxi driver.<.></.> And, sometimes, <.></.> they don't know <.></.> which way to go, you know? They don't know about <.></.> the map of New York exactly.<OL>Thank you</OL>.<F>Ah</F> seven.Early? <laughter>I don't think so</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><laughter>I don't think so</laughter>.Right now?<F>Err</F>.Shinbashi.Yes.Near station.<F>Ahh</F> yes.<SC>If you are not busy</SC>if <.></.> I was not so busy, <.></.> yeah, much earlier.No.<F>Ah</F>.Watch T V, <.></.> go out for dinner. <.></.> That's it.<laughter>I don't have</laughter> much things to do right now.<F>Ahm</F>. <.></.><F>Ah</F> yes and no.I don't want to live here forever.Too busy. Too noisy.Too <.></.> polluted. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Thank you.
