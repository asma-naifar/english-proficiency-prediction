Good morning.O K. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.I'm fine, thank you. And you?I come from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Prefecture.<F>Erm</F>. No. Actually, I was born in <F>erm</F> Osaka. But, after I got married, I moved to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city.Yes. I like it <OL>very much</OL>.<H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. It <.></.> has a very nice background <SC>as <F>ur</F> <F>erm</F> in culture</SC><SC>and</SC> probably <F>urm</F> in culture. And they have a good school, <?>prestigious</?> universities. And also, elementary schools <?>have always been nice</?>. And people are very friendly. <R>And</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> and they have a nice <F>ur</F> shopping centers.<OL>So</OL> we can just go around and have fun. So it's a very nice city.<F>Erm</F>. <.></.> You know, <R>my home</R> <F>uh</F> my hometown in Osaka, <.></.> it's <.></.> kind of difficult to say, but <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <.></.> the level of <.></.> <F>er</F> living is <.></.> rather low compared to that of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city. And also, <R>the</R> <SC>they</SC> <.></.> <F>erm</F> that city doesn't have a nice <.></.> atmosphere in schools and in town, too. So I prefer <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city than my <.></.> hometown.Yes.Family? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> In my family, I have <SC>pare</SC> my parents and my <F>ur</F> younger sister and me. So that's four of us. And <F>er</F> my <.></.> father works for the trading company, but he's retired now. And my <.></.> <F>er</F> mother has been a <R>hou</R> housewife <.></.> since she got married. And my sister, <F>urm</F> she is a sculptor. She graduated from <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> one of the <.></.> <F>er</F> art college in Kyoto And she's majored in <F>er</F> <SC>sculp</SC> <R>scu</R> <F>er</F> sculpture. But she's now being very busy about raising her child. So <SC>she really</SC> she's now <R>st</R> stopped doing her sculpture work. But she'll be <R>re</R> resuming sometime in the future, I <OL>think</OL>.<.></.> <laughter>Hobbies</laughter>? <F>Hmm</F>. <.></.> <F>Um</F>. I have been attending the translation class at <F>er</F> one of the English schools in Osaka for half a year. So I have been very busy doing homework for that school. So I really don't have much <.></.> time for <F>urm</F> doing some hobby. <SC>But</SC> so, <.></.> right now, <.></.> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> studying the translation work is <.></.> kind of <.></.> hobby to me.<F>Hm</F>. I majored in English language at my college. But, at that time, I didn't like <F>erm</F> doing the translation work. I was much more interested in doing <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> some kind of research for the linguistics or something. <SC>But, <F>er</F> after</SC> and, after I got married, I had a chance to <F>erm</F> live in the States for five years. <R>And</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> and, I don't know, <F>er</F> I just <.></.> began to think, maybe, <F>er</F> the translation <SC>will be <.></.> my</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I don't know, <SC>my</SC> will be very good for me. Because, <F>erm</F> now, I have a child, so <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> my child wants me to stay home and do something with her. So, if I do the translation as my work, I can <F>erm</F> stay at home and do the work <.></.> as well. So that's why I decided to study <.></.> <R>tra</R> translation.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL><?>Yes, I think</?></OL>.O K. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. This is a <.></.> scene in <SC>the</SC> one of the <.></.> <F>erm</F> towns. And there is a quite big house. And also, I see a lot of people, especially, children playing around the house and <F>er</F> <.></.> two women <.></.> having a chat on the road. And I see <F>er</F> one man <.></.> <SC>doing</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> running. <F>Em</F>. And <F>er</F> I see a lot of trees in the <F>ur</F> backyard of the house. And <F>er</F> <SC>the children are playing with balls</SC> the boys are playing balls. And <F>er</F> one girl is <F>er</F> <SC>doing the</SC> jumping rope <SC>at</SC> <F>er</F> in front of the house. <R>And</R> <F>er</F> and there are two dogs facing each other <laughter>in front of the</laughter> <F>er</F> <.></.> playing boys. And also, I see a gentleman sitting on a chair and reading a newspaper. <.></.> <F>Hm</F>. And there is a white car parked along the <?>crossing</?> side. And there is a <.></.> <F>um</F> cat sleeping on the roof <.></.> of that car. And <F>er</F> one of the ladies chatting, she has a dog with her. And I suppose she is <.></.> <F>erm</F> taking this dog for a walk, I think.Yes.<F>Erm</F>. First, I lived in the <F>er</F> Chicago area <.></.> <R>for</R> <.></.> for <SC>two years</SC> <F>m</F> two and a half years and then, moved to <F>er</F> San Francisco area <.></.> and lived there for another two and a half years.Chicago? <F>Erm</F>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>O K. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>The</SC> <.></.> in Chicago, we lived in the one of the town house.And we had <F>erm</F> a two stories <F>erm</F> <.></.> house. <.></.> <F>Oh</F>. It's <F>mm</F> three bedrooms. <.></.> And, while I was there, I had a baby. So, <F>erm</F> when we went to the States, we didn't have a child. So we used the whole house for <SC>us</SC> <R>the two of</R> the two of us. But, after <F>uh</F> <SC>we ha</SC> <F>uh</F> I had a baby, we have to have one room for her. And <F>er</F> we put some baby bed in one of the bedrooms. And <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>hmm</F> it changed a lot after we had a baby. <.></.> And, <F>erm</F> after we moved to <F>erm</F> San Francisco area, we lived in <F>aw</F> one of the houses. And <F>er</F> it was <F>er</F> quite a big house. And quite a big <F>er</F> backyard. So my <.></.> girl <F>erm</F> was playing a lot in backyard <F>urm</F> riding a tricycle and moved to the bicycle afterwards.<F>Mm-hm</F>. Yes. We really liked both houses.O K.<.></.> O K.Hello? <F>Erm</F>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. And I'm very sorry that I couldn't <SC>make to</SC> <F>erm</F> go to your party <.></.> tonight. <F>Erm</F>. I really wanted to go, but my girl <F>erm</F> <SC>has</SC> having a cold. And, tonight, <SC>she had</SC> all of a sudden, she had a high temperature. So I really couldn't <F>er</F> leave her alone in the house. So that's why I couldn't make it to your party. And <F>er</F> I really hope to come to your party <F>um</F> next time you had this chance. So, please call me whenever you have the party again.O K. I'm really sorry. I was really looking forward to the party myself, too. So it was a great <F>erm</F> <R>dis</R> disappointment to me,also.<F>Ah</F>. Yes. I thought of that, <F>er</F> <.></.> too. But I really didn't want to leave my child having a temperature. So, please <F>erm</F> understand it. Forgive me not able to come to your party.O K. So I hope to come to your party next time.You're welcome. And thank you.No, not really. <F>Erm</F>. Beause my child was <F>er</F> quite small, and, as I said in our conversation, I didn't want to leave her, and I didn't want <SC>to <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>try the</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> try the</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> someone to keep my child.But I didn't want to <.></.> try that. So I didn't have any chances to <?>attend parties</?>.<F>Emm</F>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. <SC>while I was in the States, I</SC> <.></.> <F>mm</F> <F>um</F> before I went to the States, I thought <F>er</F> American husband will be much more <F>erm</F> <.></.> helpful than the Japanese husband. But <F>er</F> I was talking to one of the American mothers, and <SC>said</SC> she said that <F>er</F> her husband was not really helpful either. <laughter>So I was really</laughter> <F>erm</F> <.></.> surprised to hear that. And <F>er</F> it was <F>erm</F> hubbub to raise a child, and <SC>my</SC> <F>uh</F> her husband was quite busy with work. So <.></.> I thought that some of the American <F>erm</F> <.></.> men are like Japanese men, I think.<OL><laughter><F>Oh</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I <?>agree though</?></laughter></OL>.O K.O K.<.></.> O K. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. One day last week, <F>uh</F> I was driving. And <F>er</F> I saw a man on a scooter coming <F>er</F> toward me. And <F>er</F> he was talking with somebody on the cell phone. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> And <F>er</F> <.></.> we got bumped. And <.></.> <F>erm</F> the man on the scooter <SC>dropped <SC>the cell ph</SC> <F>em</F> the</SC> dropped his cell phone. And <SC>cell phone was</SC> <F>er</F> cell phone broke. <.></.> And also, <F>erm</F> <.></.> his scooter got damaged by that accident. And <SC>he was ve</SC> <F>er</F> he was furious about it. So we called the police. And, <F>er</F> <.></.> at the time the police was there, I explained to <.></.> the policeman that the <.></.> man was riding on the scooter at the same time he was <F>er</F> talking to somebody with the cell phone. And <F>er</F> policeman understood. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <.></.> so, <R>the</R> <.></.> <SC>the man's scooter</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <.></.> at the end, <F>er</F> we called a truck to <F>er</F> <.></.> take his scooter away. <.></.> And the policeman told us that <F>er</F> <.></.> the man on the scooter was responsible for the accident. Because he was not really <F>erm</F> <.></.> cautious about riding scooter.<F>Ah</F>. Yes. Sometimes.<F>Erm</F>. <.></.> I usually drive <.></.> <F>er</F> only <.></.> around my house, because I'm not really confident <SC>on my</SC> <F>uh</F> about my driving technique. <F>Erm</F>. But, sometimes, <F>erm</F> my husband <F>uh</F> drives to Osaka. And, while I was sitting next to him, I really get scared with the driving manner of the Osaka people. Because they were always in a hurry, and they didn't really care what <F>er</F> <SC>other peo</SC> <F>uh</F> other cars were doing. So I get really scared.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>This weekend? <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. Yes. I have one appointment. <SC>It's not a very</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> you know, it's not a very happy one. Because <F>er</F> <.></.> <SC>my</SC> I'm thinking about sending my child to one of the, I don't know, prep school, <JP>juku</JP> <F>er</F> this spring. So <R>I'm</R> <.></.> I'm planning to go to the <F>er</F> prep school to listen to <F>er</F> the teachers' explanation about the <OL>courses</OL>.<SC>She</SC> yes, she's <F>er</F> nine years old. And she'll be in the fourth grade this spring.<OL><laughter>Thank you</laughter></OL>.You're welcome, <OL>and thank you</OL>.
