I just enjoy watching any kind of soccer games.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Oh</F>.<CO><OL>Should I</OL> take off</CO>?<F>Um</F> I usually go <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> because I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>,<OL>so it's very</OL> close to my house.<F>Ah</F> that's very expensive. And I figure it's not my place.<F>Er</F> because I cannot afford buying <laughter>any</laughter> products. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah. And I think I'm not <F>mm</F> suitable yet to have such expensive products. Maybe ten years later, I will go shopping around Ginza or Aoyama. But not now.<F>Oh</F> <F>um</F> I just go around the shop I like <R>and</R> <nvs>smack</nvs> and <F>er</F> <SC>it's always</SC> like accidentally find it. So that's why I cannot stop buying. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.Yeah.<F>Ur</F> I guess it's a wedding banquet, <?>I think</?>. And the girl and boy are having dinner together. Actually, the guy is having wine. I think he's tasting wine at first. Yeah. And should I explain more?O K. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F> actually <SC>it's</SC> sorry, correction. It's not wedding party. I think it's <SC>a</SC> just a restaurant, maybe expensive French restaurant. And three couples are having dinner. Yeah. And maybe waiter's explaining the wine <R>the</R> the guy with yellow suit is having.Yeah.<??></??><F>Well</F> <F>um</F> right now, I just go to more cheap cafe around my house.One of them? <F>Um</F> <SC>I ju</SC> I live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.And there are <R>a lot of</R> a lot of cafe or <?>all sorts of</?> cafe, maybe twenty or thirty all together. But I usually go to the one which is closest to my house. And <F>um</F> the reason I like that place is because they had huge amount of food which is my size.So I'm always satisfied with that amount.<F>Well</F> actually, I don't really celebrate outside like restaurant because I like cooking and I really like to have like a home party at my house.And I love to cook a lot for the people I invited. So for like Christmas or someone's birthday party, I usually cook dinner and invite some of my friends.<SC>Last one was</SC> <F>well</F> actually I have been very busy this year, so <SC>the last one was</SC> the last one I had was the Christmas party last year. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <?>That's</?> I invited about ten people and <SC>I cook a roas</SC> I made a roasted turkey and the apple pie and <F>eh</F> other stuffs. But I cooked all by myself.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Er</F> yes. Actually I was going to take <F>er</F> the train started at three P. M. but I missed the train by a small accident. So could you please exchange the ticket or <SC>can I</SC> <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> could you give back the money for me?<F>Oh</F> but <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <SC>I u</SC> actually I took a bus to get to the train and <?>bus has</?> a little accident <F>um</F> which was out of my plan. So I could be on time to take the train but there was accident and <F>um</F> I hope you can <SC>apecs</SC> accept the situation and change <R>the</R> the train ticket, please.<F>Oh</F>. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Oh</F> so O K. How about I go to the bus office now and I try to make <F>er</F> <SC>the proof</SC> <F>uh</F> some kind of notes to prove the accident? So I'll come back here in one hour. So if I have the sheets of paper, could you exchange for day to maybe tomorrow?O K. So I'll definitely come back here <R>in one</R> in one hour or so. I promise to come back here, and hopefully, <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can get the money back and <R>re</R> reserve for the next train.Yeah.Thank you very much.O K.I do.Yeah.<F>Ahh</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>well</F> I guess traveling in Japan is much easier because I don't have to speak English and I can usually understand all circumstances like transportation situations or <F>oh</F> of course culture as <F>well</F>. But the travel abroad is also fun because I always find <F>er</F> new things and that's very good study for me. And also I can practice my English. So I like both. But one thing I don't like about travel is I hate packing.So <nvs>laughter</nvs> that's the biggest problem for me.Whether I go either Japan or abroad, I usually hate packing. So that's a big <laughter>problem</laughter>.<F>Er</F> I guess the most important thing is if I really interest in the place.For example, I like art. <F>Er</F> I took art history class <SC?>this</SC?> <?>last</?> year <SC>so</SC> and <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> I'm interested in European art, so I usually pick up places where the famous museums are like especially I love London because they have a lot of galleries and art museums there. So <SC?>I ne</SC?> I went there a couple of times. And I haven't finished yet to see all the galleries and museums.O K.<F>Uh</F>. Yeah. This one?Actually, <SC?>j</SC?> <F>um</F> the page number is written like F one or B one.<F>Uh</F> this one?<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.One day last week, a friend of mine was dating with her boyfriend. But that was raining. And when they were walking on the street, they could hear <F>uh</F> a little noise and it sounded like <F>er</F> the cat's meowing. So they opened the box <?>besides a tree</?> and there was <F>er</F> one kitten in the box. And <F>er</F> my friend really wanted to have the kitty because she was really pretty. But the boyfriend was kind of thinking <SC>where</SC> <R>wha</R> what he should do. But she <SC>asks</SC> asked for <?>me</?> so many times so <SC>she fi</SC> <F>uh</F> he finally accepted her. And they decided to take the kitten and brought the <R>kit</R> kitten to their home.<??></??>I usually <SC>try to explain</SC> I mean, try to talk like why you think so and why I don't think so. And think that I try to make a compromise which both of us can agree.<OL><??></??></OL> that's the solution.<F>Er</F>.From my experience? <nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know. Or I haven't had that kind of a situation. But it's a little bit different, but I had a lot of a similar situation as this cat's story. <F>Um</F> I really love cat and wanted to have a cat. But my mother didn't want to have any cat because <R>she</R> she loves dogs but she didn't like cat because she never had <SC>c</SC> a cat. But one day, <?>one of our</?> friend told me that her friend find <F>er</F> the stray cat, a kitten. And her friend's friend was looking for someone to take care of the cat. So I said her <R>I</R> I want to have the cat because I really wanted to. But my mother said no, because she hated cat. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>actually <SC>she</SC> my mom</SC> and also that my mom went to travel. So I decided to have a catwhile she was <SC>not <SC>in</SC> at</SC> not at home. So asked <nvs>laughter</nvs> my friends to bring the cat. And now we're having a cat, and my mom's <R>loves</R> loves him.<?>The cat</?>.<OL>So</OL> it wasn't <laughter>compromising</laughter>.<OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Um</F> <??></??> <R>I</R> I may go to <?>school</?>.<OL><?>O K</?>, thank you</OL>.O K. Thank you.
