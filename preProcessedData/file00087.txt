My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Nice to meet you.<F>Oh</F>. Same as usual.<nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Well</F> I'm responsible for <F>er</F> translating <F>er</F> manuals and screens <R>so</R> sort of kind of stuff.<F>Er</F> let's see <F>er</F>. <.></.> More than eight years.Yeah.In this company. <F>Oh</F> no, in this company, I just joined <F>er</F> since <F>er</F> June first.Right.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F> that's <R><F>er</F></R> "<??></??> Software". It was <F>er</F> located in <F>er</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, <SC><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></SC> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, and I was there and you know, a company merge happened and we were acquired. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F> I live in <SC><H pn="others4">XXX06</H></SC> <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>, <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>.<F>Mm</F>. Let's see, I've never counted. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> I guess fifteen <.></.> years. <F>Uh-huh</F>No, I'm alone.<H pn="others6">XXX08</H> Prefecture.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <SC>it</SC> <F>oh</F> we had a great deal of snow in the wintertime and <F>er</F> I enjoy the snow but <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I was not good at skiing or skating or anything like that <nvs>laughter</nvs>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I love <F>er</F> the scene, you know, black and white, it's so romantic.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F> too much snow, we have to <F>er</F> take off the <F>er</F> snow from the roof. <R>It's</R> it's kind of so trouble you know, <F>er</F> you have to do it perhaps three times <.></.> or four times <SC>a year</SC> <SC>a</SC> <R>in a</R> in a season. <R>You</R> you have to pay, if you ask somebody else, a lot of money, so <R>it's</R> it's not a good point to live there <nvs>laughter</nvs>Over there?In <H pn="others7">XXX09</H>? <F>Mm</F> you know, I'm not so young so perhaps I just <F>er</F> relax at home <F>erm</F> and do <F>er</F> tiny stuff at home like <F>er</F> cleaning <nvs>laughter</nvs> washing <F>er</F> clothes you know, that kind, just plain thing. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Ahh</F> I don't know <.></.> to whom she is <nvs>laughter</nvs> talking or looking you know or, I can't tell her eyeline, yes, or <nvs>laughter</nvs>. But <R>I</R> I think <SC>she is not</SC> <R>she is</R> she is kind of in a certain level of <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a civilized or educated <F>er</F> background. Because she is having you know, <SC>elctric</SC> <F>er</F> <R>el</R> electric or electronic appliances around her. And also she loves <F>er</F> pets <.></.> but I wonder if she <.></.> has some difficulties in hearing. Maybe this is kind of <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>hearing aid</laughter> dog. Because you know, <SC>we</SC> here in Japan, we do not <F>er</F> have a dog inside of the room. <F>Er</F>. Usually we keep dogs <F>er</F> out of the house you know <nvs>laughter</nvs> so this is kind of <R>one</R> one thing I'm <F>er</F> concerned <nvs>laughter</nvs>. <F>Well</F> <.></.> I don't know <R>any</R> anything else, <R>you</R> you would like to hear?Yeah. Yeah. <R>I</R> I think <R>he</R> he is just prepared for her helping <F>er</F> <F>er</F> when somebody visits her or need boiling some water or you know, <nvs>laughter</nvs> then <R>he</R> <.></.> he will <F>er</F> <F>er</F> tell her that something is happening. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Mm</F>. It's easy to re-writing, <.></.> very handy. And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> easier to calculate <F>mm</F> and <F>er</F> nowadays it's very convenient to know something around the world, <.></.> by using Internet or e-mail, that kind. So computer is so very <F>er</F> <R>good</R> good thing. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Hm</F>. <F>Well</F>.It's hard.Because I do not do this <nvs>laughter</nvs>O K.Yes, <F>er</F> <F>er</F>. O K. <F>er</F> I bought this handkerchief yesterday and <F>er</F> <F>well</F> I thought <R>this</R> this was so rather bigger than I <F>er</F> no, <R>that's'</R> that's what <R>I</R> I imagined, but this was so smaller, so I'd like to <F>er</F> exchange this one, <F>er</F> the bigger, wider, instead of this one.<F>Oh</F>. Because I love this pattern. You know, I love this color. <nvs>laughter</nvs> That's why I bought this.But <R>I</R> I prefer to have a bigger one, bigger size.Policy?Yes, but <R>I</R> I didn't use this one yet and <F>er</F> I think <F>er</F> <F>er</F> you know, cooling-off for that kind, <R>I</R> I can <F>er</F> return this to you. And <F>er</F> <R>you</R> you can give me <F>er</F> the one I want or maybe <R>you</R> you can <F>er</F> <SC>give me the money</SC> <SC>pay</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> or pay me?Yes. But I don't like the size. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Please. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.Thank you.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.<F>Er</F>. At first, a quality, and <F>er</F> a color, pattern, <.></.> and the size.<F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. <R>I</R> I want to have <F>er</F> some <F>mm</F> natural stuff <F>er</F> <SC>one hundred percent cotton</SC> <R>one hundred percent</R> I mean pure silk, <F>er</F> or <F>er</F> linen?I don't like <F>er</F> artificial <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> textile.<F>Hm</F>?<F>Mm</F>. <R>It</R> <SC>it</SC> it's kind of you know, <R>fan</R> <R>fan</R> fancy and <F>er</F> <SC>I feel</SC> <F>oh</F> perhaps I'm <R>a</R> a little bit rich and <nvs>laughter</nvs> so <SC>I like</SC> I'm happy to have this you know, pure silk handkerchief and you know, <R>I'</R> I'm proud of myself, "I can buy this" <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F>. <F>Well</F> suppose this is me.And <F>er</F> this is my <F>er</F> uncle.And we haven't met <F>er</F> for a while and <F>er</F> <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> one day he called me that "Hey, <F>er</F> this <SC>Frid</SC> no, O K, this Saturday, <F>er</F> I'm free. Why don't we have a get-together and have <R>a</R> a dinner?". <F>Er</F> so, I agreed and he took me to the very good restaurant and <F>er</F> he said <F>er</F>, "I made a reservation for two <F>er</F> is it O K?". And <SC>he said</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>he showed us to</SC> <F>well</F> he took us to the place where we reserved.

Today is a special day since you know, <R>we</R> we haven't met so long.". So I ordered <SC>a</SC> the <F>er</F> <SC>expensive</SC> most expensive one. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And the waitress took the order, then she carried <F>er</F>. So we enjoyed the very good, pretty dinner. I love <F>er</F> beer <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> and <R>I</R> <F>er</F> I also talk some of <F>er</F> happenings or <F>er</F> things happened while <SC>we</SC> no, <R>he</R> he was away. <F>Er</F>. Then at the register, he's going to pay and I'm full. And here <F>er</F> "Thank you, uncle, I had a good time and <R>m</R> maybe you could call me <F>er</F> some <R>oth</R> other time.". <SC>Then</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> and <F>er</F> the uncle said, "Bye bye, have a good time" or something like that.<F>Er</F> you mean actual?<nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>at a restaurant</OL><F>Mm</F>.
