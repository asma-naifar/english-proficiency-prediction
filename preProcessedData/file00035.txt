 one cars and one scooter, one person, sorry. And presently they crushed. But it's a very little crush so so big thing, but for them, who actually crush, it's not small thing. It's quite big thing, it seems. So they are quarreling quite hard, it seems. And damager is person who damage the scooter ride on the car, and they are quarreling and quarreling. But solution could not make out, it seems, so they seemed to decide to call police who can provide one solution. And no, sorry, police listened scooter was brought somewhere by the truck. just from this picture, I cannot tell the person who ride on car compensate for it. But actually, just his expression from the expression of the person who ride on scooter were a little bit serious. the person who ride on the car pay for himself, it seems. And that's all.
