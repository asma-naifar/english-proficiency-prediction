O K. 
.
. One day last week.
Short story.
.
O K. One day last week,  Ken and his girlfriend were walking in the street.  then,      they could hear      some  sounds anywhere.  and    they were  trying to find the sounds   where they could  hear that. Then  they found  a cat in a box   left beside the electricity pole.  Then    his girlfriend picked a cat up. And   he said  it was very  cute cat. . .  O K. She really brought a cat to her home. But    Ken does not accept her request. So she said, "      " sorry, "Why did I bring a cat to my home"? So he said, "Because    keeping a cat  was very difficult work.  the cat has also     its own life. So      bring up a cat is a very important work and very difficult work.     so you couldn't do that. But she eagered to bring up and  asked him. So finally,   he accepted  her request. She was very happy. And            they started to go   her home. . 
O K.
No.  I never.
. Yeah.
 I don't like  keep a pet. Because  someday, a pet   will die. So it's a very sad  yes.   I don't like. .
.
. It's very good thing, I think. . .  . Sorry.  it's very good thing because  bring up and  keeping a pet is a very   good work.        sorry,  but    who  want to keep a pet</SC>  people who want to keep a pet have to      make their pets   good  .
So    sometime when I  walking the street  drops,
very very annoyed. Yes.
 really? 
 today?  today   I'll prepare  tomorrow's English class.     recently  I made English club with my family.
So tomorrow   they will come to my house, and we  learn English.
So I prepare
