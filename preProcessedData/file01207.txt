Good afternoon.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes, please.I'm O K.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> How about <OL>you</OL>?Actually, I had a business trip yesterday<OL>that I</OL> went to Tokushima. So I had to fly <R>in the mor</R> in the morning.So I feel a little bit tired because of the flight.Actually, <SC>we have it o</SC> <F>ur</F> we have a office <SC>in</SC> <R>d</R> down in Tokushima that once a month or twice a month, I have to go <F>uh</F> to Tokushima to meet our staff members,<OL>I mean Tokushima</OL> branch, actually.So yesterday, <SC>we</SC> our <F>ur</F> meeting schedule was pretty tight.<OL><SC>I</SC> <SC>from</SC></OL> <R>ff</R> from eleven in the morning to probably twelve in the midnight,<OL>we just had</OL> really,really, in a way, I mean serious but <SC>frui</SC> very fruitful <SC>meeting</SC> I mean <F>er</F> discussion <OL>yesterday</OL>.Yes.<OL>O K</OL>. I work for textbook research and development which we create the materials for our students. I mean English textbooks or workbooks and C Ds. Those like <F>ur</F> <SC>language materials</SC> English language materials for our students in <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>. And also <SC>we create</SC> I mean, of course we research <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> the English language, and also create <R>the books</R> the books that we can sell at the book stores.So we develop actually <SC>the books</SC> <F>ur</F> the English language-related books.<OL><F>Oh</F> yes, <F>oh</F> yes</OL>. Tons of difficulties at the moment.<OL>Yes</OL>.For example, we have to suit our students' needs. And students, their levels also really <?>varied</?>. So we have to examine their need and <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> language knowledge. And, how do I say, we have to research really carefully about what students expect us <SC>to be provi</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to make the really good quality textbooks. And then also, we have to examine our students' <F>ur</F> weakness. I mean, especially the Japanese language learners' weaknesses and maybe strength as well. So first, <SC>we have to really</SC> we have to be really careful what sort of <F>ur</F> needs out there in the market. Market, which means that our students. And then also, we have to make another books which appeal to <R>the</R> the various type of readers <SC>of</SC> I mean, in Japan.<OL>So</OL> it seems to be really close, but actually it's <SC>a bit diff</SC> I mean, <SC>really</SC> for us, really difficult to examine <SC>in</SC> for the various <R>re</R> readers. Readers means that they're not just students. And <SC>they</SC> you know, sometimes <R>their</R> their needs or their objectives <R>to</R> to kind of buy a book, especially related to <SC>language</SC> I mean English language is a bit different from the students. So we really have to kind of examine <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the purpose of the books and then the what kind of books that we have to create, which is <OL>quite difficult</OL>.<F>Mhm</F>.Free time. <SC>I</SC> usually I clean my apartment, then kind of do the <laughter>dishes or do</laughter> the laundries and those kind of <F>ur</F> daily routines.Because since my <SC>work</SC> <F>ur</F> working schedule is quite tight, I mean from kind of noon to midnight. Soon weekends and free time, I do mainly kind of clean my apartment <SC>and</SC> which makes me really feel comfortable, though.<OL><F>Er</F></OL> yeah. And then also cook. I love cooking.And also <R>go to</R> <SC>go to</SC> go shopping.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<nvs>smack</nvs> O K. <F>Ur</F> <SC>a couple</SC> I mean, <SC>man and a woman</SC> <.></.> I mean, this is the restaurant, and a couple is just about <.></.> having dinner at the really fancy restaurant. And the man in yellow suit is also just about drinking a wine. He actually is <SC>tasing</SC> <SC>tasting a wine</SC> tasting wine, sorry. And the woman in <SC>black</SC> <F>ur</F> no, no, no, pink <SC>sui</SC> dress is just <SC>looking at him</SC> I mean, seeing him tasting wine. And maybe waiter, I should say, or I don't know, <SC>someone who</SC> I forgot the word, but someone who actually kind of recommend really good wine to the guest, <SC>he's also</SC> he is kind of showing a bottle of <?>the</?> wine to the man who is just about tasting wine. This <R>loo</R> looks really good, fancy restaurant.And the woman in <.></.> green dress, showing her back <SC>to us</SC> to me, actually, is playing the piano.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Eat out. Yes. <OL>I love it</OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <CO><SC>My</SC> <F>ur</F> the one that I really like <OL>or</OL></CO>?O K. The restaurant <F>uh</F> that I really like is just a little bit <SC>more casual</SC> like more casual than this kind of fancy restaurant. And I love Italian foods, and I love Japanese food. <SC>So</SC> and the main big differences is just I really don't drink wine.So normally, I just order kind of mainly food, And <SC?>it's</SC?> I really like to spend a little bit more casual <SC>atmo</SC> type of atmosphere restaurant. So my favorite restaurant is really, really friendly and kind of less formal than this <OL>type of</OL> restaurant.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Thank you.Sure.<OL><CO>Good aft</CO></OL>. O K. Actually, I bought this thing <F>ur</F> couple of hours ago.Then I went home, and opened it. But unfortunately, this is not the one that I really like.<OL>So</OL> if it is possible, I'd like to return it. And then if it's still possible for you to just refund me the money, that would be really nice.<F>Oh</F> really?But actually, <SC>I didn't use it yet</SC> <R>I haven't u</R> I haven't used it yet. And <F>ur</F> you know, I really saw <R>the</R> the other one over there. I really like that, so if it's possible, is it O K for you to just change the thing?<F>Mm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<OL>But <SC>the</SC></OL> actually <R>the</R> <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the problem is the color. <SC>I really, really have noticed</SC> I mean, <SC>I</SC> <SC>after I <?>sawed</?></SC> <R>af</R> after <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I kind of thought over kind of quite long time, then I found that I really like that color, not that this color.<OL><F>Mhm</F></OL> right. Yeah. But you know, I mean, sometimes I saw it, then change my mind. Or just I <SC>think</SC> realize that <SC>I</SC> my <SC>really</SC> I mean, favorite color is that, not <OL>this one</OL>.<SC>So</SC> anyway, you know, <F>ur</F> as I told you before, but I haven't used it yet.<CO>So</CO>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>. Yeah, <SC>if you</SC> I do appreciate that if you could talk to your manager or the one who <SC>is</SC> actually supervise this section.<F>Mm-hm</F>. Sure. No problem. Thank you <OL>for your help</OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mm-hm</F>. Sure. <OL>Thank you</OL>.<OL><F>Uhhh</F></OL> yeah. Actually, even though I really realize that <F>uh</F> the one I really don't like or <SC>I</SC> <SC>the one that I</SC> <F>ur</F> I mean, <R>the</R> the things that I <SC>did</SC> don't <R>re</R> really like much, but actually I really don't bother anybody. <laughter>I mean</laughter>, <SC>the</SC> I <F>uu</F> normally gave it up. I mean, gave it up means that I normally don't go back to the store then ask for refund or to change. I just give up my ideas that <F>ur</F> <SC>might be</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>then</SC> <SC>the</SC> <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> <R>the</R> the different one might be <F>ur</F> nicer or that <SC>type of</SC> <SC>kind of</SC> way of thinking. So I just gave it up. <laughter>But</laughter> then <SC>I</SC> <SC>after I buy</SC> especially after I buy it, and then <F>ur</F> bring it back <R>m</R> <R>my</R> my home or my <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>hou</R> house, then even though <R>I</R> I realize that <SC>the</SC> this is <SC>the</SC> not <SC>the</SC> I really want,but that's O K. Maybe <R>I'll</R> I'll live with it, <laughter>or</laughter> I'll just use it. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F> I'll probably use it, but just I don't ask for the <SC>money</SC> refund or, you know, to ask for change. I mean, I really just don't want to confrontate anybody, <laughter>or</laughter> <R>just</R> just forget it. <OL><laughter><CO>I mean</CO></laughter></OL>.<OL>I don't know, I just don't want to</OL>.<F>Mm</F>.O K.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<OL>I see</OL>.<R>A guy</R> <F>ur</F> <SC>a guy</SC> <F>eee</F> one day last week. O K. A guy went to the station as usual around eight o'clock last week. <F>Ur</F> then he was waiting at <R>the</R> the platform.
