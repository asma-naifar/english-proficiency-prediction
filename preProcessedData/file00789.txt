 yeah, sometimes.  but now   I was very happy to be only one. Yeah.
. Maybe  so  if we have brothers or sisters, maybe we have a quarrel or something    and we have to share  sweets or something. .  yeah.  but I think that  it's very good to have brother or sister because     yeah, if we were adult,  so we can cooperate each other . Yeah. But now I think that it's very good to be only one.
.

O K. And so  here is a  ski field.  and  many people are skiing. And then  Yes.       I can't describe,      maybe   he gets hurt  his leg or something. And   yeah, maybe he has   yeah,  . . And then   she or he, I don't know.  But     she's snowboarding. And then maybe the only one who snowboarding.   she</SC>  yeah, and no one is in the lifts.  It's very strange, I think. And then  the guys are throwing the snowball.

We have ski place near my house.
And  it take me maybe ten minutes or so. So we can go on foot.
Yeah.
.
I think, maybe only this pictures, it looks very small. But I don't know how long the ski course is.    but  it's very narrow.  It's very dangerous, I think.  and then usually  maybe  this is slope. But  middle of the slope, there is a restaurant. It's very strange, I think.  and also   usually so we haven't maybe  some  board  or something. It's very dangerous because skier will crash into these guys. So it's very divided place. . Yeah.
Yeah.

. But  I thought yeah, maybe. 
Yeah. I like party .
Party I liked most.   So   a little bit difficult.  O K.    so I've been to the  U S. And then so  I home stayed the families,  and then so when we go back to Japan, we had a   at high school or something. And then      so everyone gathered to the high school  cafe.  and then so we had a very big party.  it's just simple. But  so we have very nice  memory because  so    each of us  received present.   and then so  they send a message to us. And  I was very impressing, and then  I cry.
So it's very nice party.
.
.
Yeah.
Thank you. 
.
. .
. . One day last week. And then   so just describe  the story. .
O K? O K.
O K.  one day last week,    he, this, O K, O K, named Mike. 
 Mike became      twenty-one, and   he can drink beer or something. And then so father  takes him to the restaurant. It's very expensive restaurant. It's very   . Yeah.   O K,  and then entered the restaurant. And then so maybe for Mike, this is the first time   to the  restaurant like that because   his father   made a reservation for this restaurant. And so  yeah, it's very     nice restaurant. And so      and then so the clerk invite them.  and then  so now that he become    twenty-one years old. And so he can drink, and so maybe  for him, this is first time   to be with father drinking  beers. And then so    he ordered beer.
 so</R> and then so this restaurant is very nice so he ordered many things.  then the beer and chicken and fish comes.  it looks very yes, very luxury. 
 and then so  he says this is a celebration of now what   you become adult, twenty-one years old. And then cheers. And then so     they drank beer and maybe wine or something and they eat. And  so they had a very good time, and  he's full now.  then   and Mike have a maybe another appointment or yeah. And maybe   his father and   he live separately. So they have to say good-bye.
. Yeah.
. Yeah. .
  I still eighteen, but I drink. I think   it's bad habit.
 what it's, but yes, maybe   if we refuse "I can't drink.".  to the fellows, maybe so everyone drinks some. So but  the  only one people refuse it,  it's very little bit   embarrassed or something. And then so O K, "  I will go together.". And I drink. Maybe it's like it. But maybe,   we are university students. .
 So   more two years we need. But it's O K.   but what we have to care about   it is  maybe    we must not drink too much.
Yeah. It's only one thing. We have to care about it. .
.
.
.
 maybe  I will go back to my home, and then I cook lunch.
Yeah.
Yeah. Today I don't have any classes.
. Yeah.
You're welcome.
