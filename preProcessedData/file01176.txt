My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.Yes, sure.<F>Um</F> pretty good. But <F>err</F> I've been suffering from jet lag still now, because I came back <F>uum</F> to Japan from New York just two days ago, so.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Err</F> I just visited my co-worker and then learned about what they usually do and something like that. Because <F>err</F> in New York branch, they had a big problem, so my co-worker told me not to interrupt and bother them, so <SC>I <laughter>just</laughter></SC> I was just <F>err</F> sitting in chair and then looked around. So actually, I didn't have pretty much time to talk to them and learn about, you know, something useful, so.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yes. <F>Er</F> almost five months.<CO><OL>Because</OL></CO>.<F>Er</F> actually, <F>err</F> <R>I</R> I came back to do same section before.So maybe I hope <F>er</F> I can catch up with them <F>err</F> <F>er</F> you know, earlier than I expect.<OL><F>Uum</F> it's not</OL> difficult for me so. <SC>And</SC> but <F>err</F> my section had already moved out Tokyo headquarters since <F>err</F> <F>uum</F> April first. <F>Uum</F> so it's kind of, you know, messy right now. Because they have to <F>er</F> adjust their system and then their daily works to new circumstances, so I have to help them. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.<OL><F>Err</F></OL>.Actually, <F>uum</F> my boss sent me to San Diego to practice my English because my English was good enough to negotiate with manufacturers and <F>um</F> paper agent. But I learned about <F>er</F> not only English but also, you know, American culture and religions and others, everything. So I'm really interested in American culture and Western culture as well. So I really want to watch American movies as much as I can. And I want to contact with American embassy, some way, I don't know right now, but I want to contact them and then find some American friends to talk in English. Because <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I don't want to, I mean, speak Japanese only, I mean, I want to keep my English very well.Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uum</F> <R>I'm</R> I'm happy because Japan got one point <R>in</R> in <R>it's</R> it's history, so. And then also, <SC>I'm happy <F>uum</F> to see</SC> I was happy to see Korea won Poland. Because <F>err</F> I have a close friend in Korea. And his name is <?>Goah</?>. <F>Err</F> I met him in San Diego and we are very good friends. And I think <R>he</R> he must have screamed and yelled. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I really happy <OL><?>right now</?></OL>.<OL>O K</OL>. Let me describe this picture at first, <F>err</F> a young girl is sitting in a chair and probably, she is <F>er</F> <F>err</F> about send some e-mails to her friend <SC>because the door</SC> and I think she's also in a hurry because the door is open. <F>Err</F> <R>and</R> <SC>and she</SC> and the cat is <F>er</F> taking a nap on the bed, and also the dog is taking a nap <nvs>laughter</nvs> on the floor. So I guess it's a <SC>nice</SC> really nice day. And the temperature is <F>er</F> kind of high. And she has a <F>err</F> C D player <F>err</F> <SC>in her hou</SC> in her room, <R>and</R> and also, she has a telephone. But I think <F>uum</F> she doesn't have many things in her room, just like me. I don't want to put many things in my room. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Err</F> <F>err</F> actually, I think it's almost same, but I don't have any pets, <nvs>laughter</nvs> of course. <SC>I'm</SC> I was not allowed to have pets in my room <SC>and I</SC> and also, I couldn't have C D player and T V in my room because my host father didn't want me to use too much electricity. So <R>I just</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I just</R> I just had <F>err</F> laptop computer and clock and bed and desk and chair or something like that. Yeah. <R>I</R> I think it's almost same.Yeah. Pretty comfortable.<F>Uhu</F>.Yes.O K.<OL>Yes</OL>.<R>I'm</R> I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>. <OL><F>Err</F></OL>.Yeah. It's kind of good. But <F>err</F> I have to ask you about that trip. Because I heard that trip is, you know, <F>err</F> by your ship. And then the ship <F>err</F> goes to, <F>err</F> you know, <F>err</F> Tokyo Bay and then <SC>go around</SC> <F>err</F> go to <F>err</F> Yokohama Bay. <F>Ee</F> it takes <F>err</F> two hours and <SC>we can have a</SC> <R>we</R> we are supposed to have <F>err</F> a great dinner. But <F>er</F> <F>err</F> the ship <F>er</F> just went <SC>to</SC> <F>er</F> around Tokyo Bay, and then, <SC>I</SC> you know, I was served but the food <F>uu</F> was kind of, you know, small and then <R>I</R> <R>I had</R> I hadn't enough meal.I mean <F>err</F> they just served <F>er</F> <F>err</F> <SC>a piece of bread</SC> <SC>kind of bread</SC> sandwiches. But <F>er</F> <SC>your</SC> <SC>I</SC> <R>when I</R> when I read your advertisement <F>err</F> on the paper, you said <F>err</F> you served <F>err</F> a French dishes. But it was <F>err</F> just sandwiches.But <F>err</F> <R>I</R> <R>I don't</R> I don't think so. <CO>So <OL>and also</OL></CO>.<OL>High quality sandwiches</OL>? But <R>I heard <F>err</F> you</R> I heard you serve <F>er</F> at least five dishes. But <F>err</F> they gave me just one sandwiches. I think it's totally different from your, you know, plan or your trip<OL><?>you showed me</?></OL>. No. <OL><SC>I just arrived there</SC></OL>you know, I just arrived at <F>err</F> the designated point on time, definitely, exactly on time.<OL><R>I don't</R></OL> I don't understand <SC>what's going on and</SC> you know, what was going on.<F>Er</F> really? <SC>So</SC> and also, <R>wh</R> <R>what</R> what about <F>err</F> the course of the ship? <CO>I mean</CO>.No. <SC>It's</SC> it was very fine day and then, you know, it wasn't raining.So <SC>I</SC> actually, I was not satisfied with <SC>your</SC> you know, this trip.

Actually, that was the first time to <F>er</F> no, not first time, I'm sorry, but <F>er</F> <F>err</F> I went Indonesia last year on business. That was the first time to go abroad for me. So actually, <SC>I</SC> you know, <R>I</R> I didn't go somewhere so many <OL>times</OL>.<OL><F>Err</F> <F>err</F></OL>.Actually, when I was collage, I tried to go somewhere <F>err</F> <SC>before graduation</SC> <SC>ex</SC> before graduation. But <F>err</F> my mother <F>err</F> came down because of her disease.<F>Err</F> <SC>her</SC> <SC>maybe</SC> I don't know the exact name but <F>er</F> she had a big problem <F>err</F> inside her head, on the brain, so I didn't have time to go. And then <SC>I have to nurse</SC> I had to nurse when I was in university.<OL>Yeah so <laughter>yeah</laughter></OL>. <SC>So</SC> and also <F>uum</F> Indonesia is kind of exciting.<OL>Yeah</OL>. I arrived at Djakaruta Airport at first, but <F>er</F> my luggage was gone. <F>Er</F> maybe someone took it.<CO><OL>But it's</OL></CO>. <R>No</R> no, it's not Garuda.<OL>It's <R>JAL</R> JAL</OL>. Japanese Airline. But I don't know <SC>but</SC> why but, it's still missing.It's still missing.And I got <F>er</F> <SC>di</SC> heavy diarrhea. And you know, I lost all my luggage, I got diarrhea, I couldn't do anything. <nvs>laughter</nvs><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Uhu</F>.O K.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Uhu</F>. One day last week, <F>err</F> Taro was <F>err</F> going his office. <F>Er</F> he was a freshman, he just entered the company. And that day was the first time for him to go to his office. So he got up early in the morning. And he arrived at <F>err</F> the station. But <F>err</F> on the platform, <F>err</F> he dropped his <F>err</F> briefcase <F>err</F> on the rail. And <F>err</F> actually, <F>ee</F> <SC>the guy <F>ee</F> who was talking</SC> the old guy who was talking to his co-worker <F>er</F> pushed his hand, that's why he dropped his briefcase. So he put too much blame on the old guy, and he complained <SC>about</SC> a lot about it. And also the train <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ee</F> <R>came</R> came to the platform and then his luggage <F>uum</F> was <F>err</F> run over <nvs>laughter</nvs> by the train. And then <SC><??></??></SC> but fortunately, <F>err</F> his luggage <F>ee</F> was <F>err</F> safe. <SC>And then</SC> and finally, he asked the station clerk to <SC>pick <F>um</F> his baggage</SC> <F>er</F> pick up his baggage. <SC>And then</SC> but I think <F>ur</F> <SC>it's</SC> it was kind of <F>er</F> problem because he was lack of <F>er</F> sociability because he shouldn't have put such too much claim on the old guy. And <R>that</R> that's why he was late for his opening time.<F>Err</F> actually, <F>err</F> I live in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>.

It's just <R>too</R> too many people. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Err</F> <SC>when I</SC> you know, <SC>when I take a</SC> when I take trains, <F>err</F> the train is always jam-packed, and too much people and <F>um</F> every one <F>uum</F> is in a hurry, kind of, you know, and then if I, you know, crash some people, <F>uum</F> people always get angry. So I don't like use the trains.<OL>But I have to</OL> do <laughter>that</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Uhu</F></OL>.Yes.<F>Uum</F> actually, <R>I</R> I will have some meetings because I don't know what to do yet.
