My name is .
Yes, sure.
 pretty good. But I've been suffering from jet lag still now, because I came back to Japan from New York just two days ago, so.
.
 I just visited my co-worker and then learned about what they usually do and something like that. Because in New York branch, they had a big problem, so my co-worker told me not to interrupt and bother them, so sitting in chair and then looked around. So actually, I didn't have pretty much time to talk to them and learn about, you know, something useful, so.
.
Yes. almost five months.
.
 actually, I came back to do same section before.
So maybe I hope I can catch up with them you know, earlier than I expect.
 it's not but my section had already moved out Tokyo headquarters since April first. so it's kind of, you know, messy right now. Because they have to adjust their system and then their daily works to new circumstances, so I have to help them. 
.
.
Actually, my boss sent me to San Diego to practice my English because my English was good enough to negotiate with manufacturers and paper agent. But I learned about not only English but also, you know, American culture and religions and others, everything. So I'm really interested in American culture and Western culture as well. So I really want to watch American movies as much as I can. And I want to contact with American embassy, some way, I don't know right now, but I want to contact them and then find some American friends to talk in English. Because I don't want to, I mean, speak Japanese only, I mean, I want to keep my English very well.
Yes. 
 I'm happy because Japan got one point in it's history, so. And then also, to see I have a close friend in Korea. And his name is . I met him in San Diego and we are very good friends. And I think he must have screamed and yelled. So I really happy .
. Let me describe this picture at first, a young girl is sitting in a chair and probably, she is about send some e-mails to her friend and I think she's also in a hurry because the door is open. and the cat is taking a nap on the bed, and also the dog is taking a nap on the floor. So I guess it's a really nice day. And the temperature is kind of high. And she has a C D player in her room, and also, she has a telephone. But I think she doesn't have many things in her room, just like me. I don't want to put many things in my room. 
Yes.
 actually, I think it's almost same, but I don't have any pets, of course. I was not allowed to have pets in my room and also, I couldn't have C D player and T V in my room because my host father didn't want me to use too much electricity. So I just had laptop computer and clock and bed and desk and chair or something like that. Yeah. I think it's almost same.
Yeah. Pretty comfortable.
.
Yes.
O K.
.
 I'm . .
Yeah. It's kind of good. But I have to ask you about that trip. Because I heard that trip is, you know, by your ship. And then the ship goes to, you know, Tokyo Bay and then go to Yokohama Bay. it takes two hours and we are supposed to have a great dinner. But the ship just went around Tokyo Bay, and then, you know, I was served but the food was kind of, you know, small and then I hadn't enough meal.
I mean they just served sandwiches. But when I read your advertisement on the paper, you said you served a French dishes. But it was just sandwiches.
But I don't think so. .
? But you at least five dishes. But they gave me just one sandwiches. I think it's totally different from your, you know, plan or your trip

you know, I just arrived at the designated point on time, definitely, exactly on time.
 you know, what was going on.
 really? and also, what about the course of the ship? .
No. it was very fine day and then, you know, it wasn't raining.
So actually, I was not satisfied with you know, this trip. So I really want to get some reimbursement. So can you do that for me?
O K.
Yeah. Thank you.
 for your call. .
.
Exciting trip? Actually, that was the first time to no, not first time, I'm sorry, but I went Indonesia last year on business. That was the first time to go abroad for me. So actually, you know, I didn't go somewhere so many .
 .
Actually, when I was collage, I tried to go somewhere before graduation. But my mother came down because of her disease.
 I don't know the exact name but she had a big problem inside her head, on the brain, so I didn't have time to go. And then I had to nurse when I was in university.
 and also Indonesia is kind of exciting.
. I arrived at Djakaruta Airport at first, but my luggage was gone. maybe someone took it.
 no, it's not Garuda.
 JAL why but, it's still missing.
It's still missing.
And I got heavy diarrhea. And you know, I lost all my luggage, I got diarrhea, I couldn't do anything. 
.

O K.
.
. One day last week, Taro was going his office. he was a freshman, he just entered the company. And that day was the first time for him to go to his office. So he got up early in the morning. And he arrived at the station. But on the platform, he dropped his briefcase on the rail. And actually, who was talking pushed his hand, that's why he dropped his briefcase. So he put too much blame on the old guy, and he complained a lot about it. And also the train came to the platform and then his luggage was run over by the train. And then his luggage was safe. and finally, he asked the station clerk to his baggage pick up his baggage. but I think it was kind of problem because he was lack of sociability because he shouldn't have put such too much claim on the old guy. And that's why he was late for his opening time.
 actually, I live in . Do you know ?
It's a part of -.
.
 took Line from Station to Station, and I changed the train for and I took Line from to, actually, , because my office is located in , .
 worst part? It's just too many people. you know, when I take trains, the train is always jam-packed, and too much people and every one is in a hurry, kind of, you know, and then if I, you know, crash some people, people always get angry. So I don't like use the trains.
 do . 
.
Yes.
 actually, I will have some meetings because I don't know what to do yet. So I have to catch up with them, and then I have to help them. So in order to do that, I have to prepare some specific topics and strategies and you know, some schedules, I have to talk to my boss and then co-workers.
.
Yeah. .
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
