Good morning.My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes.Nice to meet you, too.<F>Er</F> it's fine.<OL>But</OL> you know, I'm still student so <SC>I</SC> it's very hard to get up early.But I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And it takes more than one hour to come here so<OL>it's very difficult</OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.On the train? <R>I just</R> I just slept.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Well</F> almost three years. Because, you know, <F>um</F> my university is located in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So <SC>I'm not</SC> personally, I'm, you know, originally from <F>ee</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> so<OL>when</OL> <SC>I was</SC> I became the university student, I came to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Well</F> it's good place.<OL>But</OL> you know, it's little bit boring. <laughter>You know</laughter>, because, you know, I spent three years already so I just want to move another city <OL>right now</OL>.<F>Hm</F> <F>hm</F>. It's <R>ve</R> very beautiful city. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.Because, you know, <.></.> <?>it's got</?> many trees and nice parks and good places. But, you know, compare with <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>you know, <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> is more convenient. You know, the metro lines and, you know, <SC>the transport is</SC> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>'s transport is better than <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><H pn="others2">XXX04</H> area</OL>.<H pn="others2">XXX04</H> area.<OL><H pn="others2">XXX04</H> area is</OL> you know, very congested. But I'm get used to it already so it's not really a problem for me.But, you know, <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is <F>well</F> <.></.> very convenient but <SC>little bit diffi</SC> little bit different from <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> area, like pronunciation <??></??> <OL>people</OL>.And, you know, <SC>the people is</SC> I think the people is also different from <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> area.School life?<OL><F>Well</F></OL> my school life is almost finished in <??></??> already. And I got all credit as well. So now <R>I'm</R> I'm not spending so much school life right now. <SC>I'm</SC> you know, <SC>part-time</SC> I'm doing part-time job <laughter>right now</laughter> <F>um</F> to <SC>get</SC> earn money. So <SC>last</SC> <SC>it</SC> <R>this</R> this is last year, so I want to travel <R?>arou</R?> around the world. <F>Um</F> you know, so I'm not going to school so muchright now.Part-time job? I'm working at a hotel. You know, a hotel restaurant as a waiter. <F>Uum</F> and, you know, it's, you know, very hard. Because <SC>hotel</SC> for the breakfast, we have to start working about six o'clock in the morning. And when we work at night time, I have to finish my job about eleven or twelve o'clock at night. So it's very hard job.Problem?<OL>At the hotel</OL>? <F>Well</F> <F>well</F> some customers, <R>you</R> you know, is very difficult tohandle with. <F>Erm</F> but <SC>it's</SC> you know, some customers are pretty good and very friendly. And if we gave nice service, then they will be very happy, so I'm very happy, too.<OL>I want to be</OL> but, you know, still it's very difficult.Free time?<F>Uhu</F>. <F>Uum</F> <SC>I'm playing soccer for almost</SC> I have played soccer <SC>for ten years</SC> more than ten years. So <?>it's</?> free time, I still join soccer club and play soccer. And World Cup <SC>is started</SC> was started. And it was, you know <laughter>pretty</laughter> good time. But it's almost finished, <R>so</R> yeah, <SC>so</SC> <F>well</F> I'm little bit sad about it <OL>right now you know</OL>.<SC>It's been</SC> because it has been big festival <OL>so</OL>you know, pretty good but, you know, I'm now really sad.<F>Uhu</F>.Yes.O K.The teacher is a woman and probably teaching mathematics. <F>Erm</F> some students are concentrated on this class. But most them are not. <F>Well</F> I think it's not <??></??> school because <.></.> the student age looks like different. Some of them are looks like in getting pretty older and some of them are pretty young. And, you know, some probably the <R>old</R> oldest man <R>is</R> is <?>asleep</?>. And another younger man <SC>was</SC> is drinking. And some young girl is talking each other. So they don't really concentrated on this. Maybe the mathematics, the content <SC>is difficult</SC> looks like difficult. You know, it's <??></??> thing. I don't like as well. And teacher <.></.> don't care much about the students' concentration. Simply she did the lesson. And <R>I don't</R> I don't know she cares either, you know, the students is understanding or not. <SC>The</SC> I think that <SC>she's doing</SC> <SC>she's just doing</SC> she just did and you know, not caring much about this. <SC>And</SC> but, you know, it's looks like a pretty new school as well. Because, you know, she's got the portable phone. But when I was a student, like in high school age, <laughter>there's no</laughter> portable phone.<OL>So</OL> it's <nvs>laughter</nvs> looks <SC>like very</SC> <.></.> pretty recently, looks like. <F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>uum</F>.<F>Um</F> high school?<F>Well</F> actually, I spent high school years in Netherlands. Because my father was transfered to Netherlands for three years. So I spend three years in Netherlands.<F>Um</F> so <SC>it's</SC> you know, of course, it's pretty <SC>difficult</SC> different from this picture. <SC>And</SC> but you know, in general, you know, we had a school uniform. And this picture, you know, don't have <R>school</R> school uniform. So it's little bit different. And also <SC>we</SC> of course, we don't have portable phone. <SC>We s</SC> we were not allowed to put the earphone as well. <SC>So</SC> but, you know, <SC>the co</SC> <R>the</R> the lesson <F>ee</F> they are doing, like mathematics, it's stressing. <SC>I</SC> probably, I did the same thing, you know, probably, the same thing as well. I can't remember right now, but <??></??> probably, I did the same thing.And <F>well</F> it's a difference, <F>well</F> and <SC>we</SC> of course, we went to school for the <R>same</R> same age.Attitude?<OL><F>Well</F> <R>my school was</R></OL><OL><F>well</F></OL> my school was in <F>er</F> pretty, you know, hard school, you know. Because it was international and everyone <R>has</R> has to study very hard<OL>to graduate</OL> it, you know. So attitude is of course <??></??> and <R>we</R> <SC>we'll fail when</SC> <SC>if</SC> <R>you know</R> you know, if we do not study very hard, so attitude is very good. <F>Well</F> very <??></??>. And teacher was very strict, so if we do not concentrate, then, you know, she <SC>starts to</SC> you know, <F>well</F> start getting angry. <laughter>So</laughter> the attitude looks like pretty different from the picture.<OL><R>Yes</R></OL> yeah. But it was very hard, too. Because, you know, I first went to Netherlands <SC>for</SC> when I was, you know, fifteen years old. So you know, it's very older. So we have to memorize <??></??> words to, you know, <R>we</R> we already did in Japanese. But, you know, I didn't know how to say in English. So like "photosynthesize" or, you know, "cell" or every single words, memorize again in English. So it was very hard as well.Thank you.<F>Uhu</F>.Thank you.Should I telephone?O K. <F>Erm</F> excuse me?<F>Oh</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Um</F>.Hello.<F>Um</F>.

So anyway, socan you just call for professional to repair them?O K. Please. So can you bring <SC>a plastic bag</SC> plastic bags right now?<F>Uhu</F>.O K. Fine.O K. Fine. Thank you.See you later. Bye.You're welcome.<F>Uhu</F> <OL>yes</OL>.<OL>For</OL>?Yeah. Air conditioning was broken <OL>from last June</OL>.And it was also same trouble but, you know, they repaired, you know, well. You know, what should I say <SC>the bo</SC> the one who <F>uu</F> rent <SC>the</SC> my house.It's company. But, you know, they repair <SC>as</SC> very quickly so it was very fine. <R>Y</R> you know, because, you know, in July, it's very hot.Without the air conditioning. It's very difficult to survive, so.It was very good.<OL><F>Uhu</F></OL>.<F>Well</F> it's, you know, <laughter>free</laughter>. <CO>Because you know</CO>.<F>Well</F> <SC>my</SC> <R>from</R> from parents, you know, <SC>just they ca</SC> <R>all they</R> all they can do is just call for once a week or so. So, you know, in general, we can do things we want. Because, you know, we drink and go back by morning or <?><SC>sun</SC> when the sun comes up</?> you know, <SC>we</SC> <SC>what</SC> we can do anything we want to do.That's, you know, pretty enjoyable. <laughter>But</laughter> you know, sometimes <?>Sunday</?> when I watch a T V <SC>by only one</SC> you know, by myself only so, you know, there is no person to talk with, so, you know, sometimes I feel <laughter>sad about that</laughter>.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Um</F>.O K.One day last week, a man was driving a car. Should I say a man or? <CO><OL><F>Er</F> I was</OL></CO>.A man was driving a car. And also, at the same time, <SC>the</SC> another man was driving motorbikes <SC>but she</SC> but, you know, the man <SC>calling</SC> driving motorbike was also <F>ee</F> calling with girlfriend or something. And <F>well</F> <SC>she</SC> he was also talking <F>ee</F> during driving. So, you know, he's not very concentrated on the way <?>of view</?>. And unfortunately, then, the car and motorbikes was crashed. And <SC?>the</SC?> when it crashed, the portable phone was falling down. And <SC>tha</SC> it was actually broken. <F>Erm</F> because it was broken, and also motorbikes was little bit broken. It doesn't looks like, you know, all broken. So partially broken. And <SC>the man</SC> <SC>each other</SC> two men were getting angry, you know, of course.And because, you know, for the man driving a car, <SC>it</SC> the bad person was <??></??> the man <??></??> driving, you know, motorbikes. Because, you know, he was <??></??>. But for the man driving the motorbikes is the <SC>good</SC> bad <R>one is the</R> one is the driving car. Because he broke the motorbikes and the portable phone. Probably, portable phone's not broken, I think. <laughter>Because</laughter> you know, you got all the data <F>erm</F> <SC>for the every</SC> telephone number for every friends or so. <laughter>So</laughter> maybe <R>he</R> he'll lost <laughter>some friend's as well</laughter>. And <.></.> therefore, they called police and, you know, <SC>they said what</SC> they said to policeman what they want to say about trouble. And finally, you know, <.></.> <SC>they go to</SC> <SC>they</SC> policeman made a document, you know, decide which one is bad, which one is <.></.> problematic. And finally, the motorbike was carried by trucks. <laughter>You know</laughter> and the man driving motorbike was standing alone for looks like <??></??> this result. <F>Uum</F> that's the end of story. <?>There you are</?>.<F>Uhu</F>.Yes.In Netherlands<??></??> transport is pretty bad. But compare with other European countries, it's pretty good. It's said, you know, it's pretty good. Train late, you know, train's <?>fair bit high</?> they say. But, you know, for Japanese, <nvs>laughter</nvs> it's totally different from the European <OL>people</OL>.Because, you know, when we, you know, travel Japan, the <R>tr</R> train always comes very accurate by about one or two minutes for each.But, you know, in the Netherlands, five minutes late is, you know, usual. Five minutes late isusual. <SC>And</SC> but, you know, in European country, it's always the case. <F>um</F> if go to <R>south cou</R> <R>sou</R> southern country like France or Spain or Greece, <F>well</F> you know, <laughter>thirty minutes late is usual</laughter>.You know, for the European people, <R>Dutch</R> Dutch train network is pretty good. But, you know, <SC>I</SC> you know, <SC>I travel</SC> I went to school by the train and buses. So buses are always, you know, pretty accurate and very convenient. But, you know, for the train, you know, five minutes late is usual. So <SC>you</SC> if we go to school, <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> you know, I sometimes became late for school as well <SC>for</SC> because transport network. You know, <R>it's</R> <SC>it's</SC> you have an excuse, so, you know, it wouldn't be really problem.Thank you.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Uhu</F>.<OL><F>Well</F></OL>.<OL><R>Yes</R> yes</OL>. Surely, it's last time. <F>Um</F> I'm planning to go to the Europe again. So probably like Spain to the Italy by <R>Mediterr</R> Mediterranean Sea. <CO>And</CO>.<F>Uum</F> for Spain, it's the second time. I've been to Granada City area and the Cordova <SC>for</SC> <SC>about</SC> you know, about two years ago with my family. But this time, I'm going with my friends. And I travel <F>well</F> by train. Because, you know, I cannot drive the left-handle car. And also, I cannot use the mission car, probably. Because <SC>I got license but</SC> you know, I got the mission license but you know, there is no chance toyou know, use the mission car in Japan. Almost no chance. It's <??></??> so <SC>it's</SC> I'm afraid little bit to drive the mission car. So I probably <SC>train</SC> use the train to travel around. And from Spain, I will go to France and go to beaches and, in fact, there are very good beaches in France, and <??></??>. So finally, I'll go to Rome and go back to Japan. So, you know, about three weeks long. So probably, it's the last time to go such a long time to go to travel.<OL>O K</OL>.Thank you.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
