O K. It's fine day,  Maybe Sunday after noon. Everyone   wants to go out, and have fun. . In front of the house,  a girl is playing with her jump rope. . Two boys are playing with their balls.      . And also   two women are talking each other. . One of the  women  is on her way to take her dog walk.
?
.  Let's see.  . First of all,  my neighborhood is more crowded with houses. And  there's not  huge road like this.  there isn't  huge space between houses. . And    there isn't a space like  there's a bench,   and you can sit there relaxing or something. We don't have that.    but when you go out to the crowded area, we have lots of parks there. And small parks. And  children usually go to play there.
 O K.
This is  .

. So  can you go with me?
Really? That's good.  .  Then when do we meet?
.  Me, either.

go see a movie?
  maybe twelve o'clock or so?
. Then  where do we meet?
Anywhere?
.  . How about Shinjuku? It's a good place to go see a movie.
All right?
 O K. Then  we'll meet at  Shinjuku Station.   do you familiar with    the south exit area ?
O K. Then  we'll meet inside the  south exit area.
O K.
All right.
Twelve o'clock.
O K.
See you.
Bye.
.
.  Actually  I don't go see a movie often.
 I'd rather rent a videos. .  .
 . It's cheap first of all. . And    I don't like to go into the crowd of people. So   I can watch it at my home relaxing.
.
One day last week.  Maybe these guys are father and son.
O K?
O K. One day last week,  the father and his son went to a restaurant. . They're really hungry. . And  the waiter takes them to the table. .  . And   they ordered the meal. . And       now that the son is twenty years old, he can drink with his father. And so they ordered beer and the  dishes like fish and meat. And they ate a lot. .   . The father  paid the fee   for celebrating  his son's    twentieth birthday. .     and then they said good bye.   .
Thank you.
Last birthday.
  . I went to a French restaurant at Mitaka.
.
. .  It's a very nice restaurant with  a lot of space, and  the course dishes are very good. . And  we went there because   they send us   invitation card . . Yeah. . 
 and it's rather  casual. . 
Today?  I'm free today.

. Yes, that's right.
 Thank you.
