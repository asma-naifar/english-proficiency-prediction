O K.
. there are train station, and there are two river. . one river is "South" and another river is "North".
And I think in this map, there are school or supermarket or hospital, bank
and zoo, so I think this city is very convenient,
 I think there are many student and many people
live in this city. And it is good to be many trees in this city.
 and there is big restaurant in center of the city.
.
. My home 
very country side.
So, for example my bus to home finish on six fifty , early.
So it's very very unconvenient.
So, this city is very convenient.

.
 because there are school,
so I think some store
 sells clothes and if I go to this school,
it is good if I can go to 
 places 
I can eat some .

O K. my mother watch the refrigerator,
but there are no food. So many food, and she paid the money for the food. She used her car. And her car is green.
And she bought foods by herself, and she carried the food by myself. I think it was very heavy. 
 and she cook some very good, delicious dishes
 food. .
.
. Yes, but now I have part-time job and I am busy for that, so I can't cook
now.
 recently, I want to cook stew.
.
 I think it is same from curry,
so potatoes and carrots
and onion
and meat, I cut them, and I put them on the pan.
And, I always don't wait them to be perfect,
 I always put the roux
soon. and, I put little milk,
 and I think it is delicious to put on a wiener
 instead of meat. I think it is good.

Today? so my friend is ready for the moving.
So I will help her
 from now.

Thank you.
