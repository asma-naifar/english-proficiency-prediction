Yes. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's famous for <H pn="school name1">XXX05</H>.But <F>urm</F> there are a lot of local people, <F>erm</F> other than students. And <F>er</F> it's very handy to go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> or to other areas. <F>Hm</F>. Yes.<F>Er</F>. I take <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> Line.Yes.It can leads to everywhere.<OL><F>Er</F> yes</OL>. There are a lot of shops, and <F>er</F> one of the supermarket is open until one o'clock. <OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>Yes</OL>.And <SC>there is another</SC> <F>um</F> <F>oh</F> <SC>there's</SC> there are other convenience stores around the area. So, yes, it is very convenient.No, I live by myself.<F>Oh</F>. I have to cook dinner, even if I work late. And <F>er</F> also, <F>um</F> I have to clean the room. It's very small though, <F>er</F> you know, even if I'm very tired on weekends. But, <F>um</F> anyhow, <F>um</F> I enjoy living by myself, yeah.No, <F>um</F> my parents live in <F>erm</F> south Kyusyu. So <F>er</F> it's far away. <.></.> So, no. <F>Erm</F>. And, yeah, they haven't been <F>um</F> to my place yet.<F>Hmm</F>.Yes, I do.<F>Er</F>. I work at the <F>er</F> administration department <F>er</F> in <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the foreign law firm.Exactly? Yes, <F>um</F> my main job is <F>um</F> towards the <F>er</F> human resources and <F>er</F> other administrative works. <F>Hmm</F>. So I have to arrange personnel, recruiting people and <F>er</F> coordinating <F>er</F> temp staff, if necessary.<laughter>Stressful, yes</laughter>.<F>Oh</F> <F>mm</F>. I go out with my close friends over the weekends or <F>um</F> <F>oh</F> if I feel like staying home, I just relax at home <F>um</F> over listening to music <F>er</F> or, <F>oh</F> in these days, I try aromatherapy. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Aromatherapy is like you use <F>em</F> essential oil or <F>um</F> candles with fragrance so that it makes you really feel relaxing.<F>Ah</F>. You can buy <F>er</F> anywhere in the city, I think. <F>Um</F>.<.></.> I can't exactly <F>er</F> tell you right now, but <F>er</F> there are a lot of shops selling those <F>erm</F> essential oils.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>.<F>Hm-huh</F>.Right. <.></.> Sure. <F>Um</F>. Yes. <F>Er</F>. One of the girl <F>erm</F> is sitting in her room. And <F>er</F> <F>well</F> <SC>there is a P C</SC> <F>um</F> P C is on the desk in front of her. And <F>oh</F> typewriter is on the desk as well. And, <F>er</F> at the center of the room, <F>um</F> there is a dog. And, on the right-hand side, <F>erm</F> <F>um</F> there is a cat on the bed. Door is open. <.></.> And also, <F>oh</F> she has a stereo <F>er</F> on the shelves which <F>um</F> contains a lot of books, and telephone near the door. <F>Er</F>. The calendar is on the wall <F>ah</F> over the stereo. On the <F>er</F> left-hand side, there is a clock and window <F>erm</F> with <F>er</F> a brown curtain <.></.> which is open.<F>Mm</F>. No, my room is not as <laughter>big as this</laughter>.Yes. <F>Erm</F>. And <F>er</F> <F>well</F> I have no space for such a big desk. But I have a bed and <F>er</F> a small table and T V <F>um</F> near the window.Good place? <F>Hm</F> <F>well</F> <F>well</F>. Actually, I've been in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> for nearly two years, <SC>so</SC> but I'm not really familiar with the areas in <F>er</F> different places. So, <F>um</F> maybe, <F>um</F> I ask one of the agency. Actually, I found <SC>my place</SC> <F>ur</F> current place <F>um</F> through the agency, too. And she is really good. The person in charge was very kind, and <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>um</F> I can just give her all information I want. And she could arrange almost everything. <F>Em</F>. So <F>erm</F> I might try that way again.Which one to take? <F>Hm</F>. First of all, <F>er</F> whether it's <F>er</F> convenient <SC>to</SC> for commuting or not. Secondly, <F>er</F> <.></.> the room itself. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F>. <SC>I</SC> <?>that's</?> more importance to the window <F>er</F> facing to the big road, or <F>um</F> <.></.> I really don't want to take the place <F>um</F> with the window <F>er</F> just close to the <SC>another building</SC> another <OL>side of the building</OL>.So, <F>er</F> in that case, I wouldn't take it.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.Hello? This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.<F>Oh</F>. How are you?<F>Oh</F> <F>er</F>. I'm so sorry. I'm working right now. And then, I cannot leave the office.<F>Ah</F>. I'm so sorry, but I was engaged <F>er</F> on the phone. And then, <F>erm</F> probably, I have to finish my report. <F>Um</F>. It might take a while. So I'm terribly sorry, but, yeah, I can't make it tonight.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. Thank you very much. <F>Um</F>. I really appreciate what you doed for me, but, <F>um</F> <F>well</F> frankly speaking, I cannot make it today. And, can I make it up some other time?Yeah. I'm <laughter>sorry</laughter>.Thank you.<OL>Please enjoy</OL> the party then.<F>Err</F>. <SC>For the</SC> you mean, I missed the party?Yes. Actually, one of my friend <F>er</F> was waiting for me in the restaurant by herself. And I was supposed to be there, but <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> yeah, I really couldn't make it, because <F>er</F> my boss asked me to do some <F>er</F> job. And <F>er</F> I mean, which I wasn't expected. And <F>er</F> I couldn't say "No.". So, <F>um</F> in that case, I rang her at the restaurant. <F>Um</F> <F>eh</F>. She's already had <F>um</F> small amount of meal on the table. And she said, "<F>Oh</F>.". Yeah, she was a bit upset. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But, <F>um</F> <F>hm</F> <F>well</F> after that, I explained her and how I was <F>er</F> and what the situation was. So she understood.And, <F>er</F> yeah, <F>er</F> I made it up <laughter>for her</laughter>. So, then, it was O K.Mostly? <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>. <R>Wh</R> when you are required, <F>well</F> you cannot say "No.". <R>But</R> but, although <F>er</F> you cannot say "No." to your boss. I mean, <F>um</F> for example, the job offered to you, you <OL>can't miss it</OL>.But <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I want to have a policy of my job. So, maybe, say, even if my boss said to do this or that, <F>er</F> <R>if</R> <.></.> if something wrong with it <F>er</F> or if <F>er</F> something will happen in the future, <R>I</R> I might tell my boss, because <SC>my</SC> <SC>maybe, I</SC> I might know my work <F>er</F> better than <SC>he does</SC> he or she does. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.<F>Er</F>. One day last week, <F>erm</F> a man drove <F>er</F> along the beach. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> from the opposite side of the road, <F>er</F> there was a man <R>dri</R> <F>ee</F> driving <SC>the <F>er</F> motorcycle</SC> <F>er</F> the bike.<F>Er</F>. <SC>We</SC> <F>er</F> he is wearing pink sunglasses. And, <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>um</F> O K, they <.></.> nearly collided <F>um</F> in the middle of the road. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Er</F>. <SC>It just so the</SC> <F>em</F> the bike scratched the another car. And <SC>the man from</SC> <F>er</F> a man got off from the car. And he was very upset because it scratched his car. But <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>the</R> the man on <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the bike was also upset. Because <SC>it</SC> <F>er</F> his bike was hit. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Er</F>. Then, police arrived <F>er</F> the site. And <F>er</F> <F>um</F> the man <.></.> <F>er</F> from the car was explaining what had happened. <F>Um</F>. So <R>the</R> the policeman <F>um</F> was listening to them. And, <F>um</F> in the end, <F>um</F> the bike was <F>um</F> taken away from which <F>er</F> truck arranged by police <nvs>sniff</nvs> department. And <F>er</F> <SC>the man <F>er</F> <.></.> was <F>um</F> watching it</SC> the man from <R>the</R> the bike was watching it.<?>Maybe, it's not</?> good enough? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>No, I don't. I don't have license either.<F>Er</F>. It's very stupid things, but <F>er</F> <F>em</F> I went to a fortuneteller long time ago. And I was told not to have <R>driver's</R> <F>er</F> driver's license. It's <SC>very</SC> sound very stupid. <CO>But</CO>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Thank you. <F>Er</F>. I was told that <F>er</F> if I drove a car, I might have killed somebody in a traffic accident. So I didn't want it to happen.<F>Well</F>. Usually, I don't. But, in this case, it involves somebody's life. So, <F>er</F> yes. I was very scared.<OL>And</OL> then, I can do without a <OL>car</OL>.In fortune telling?<F>Err</F>. If it's <OL>good things I <laughter>will believe it</laughter></OL>, but if it's bad, I'll try to <R>forg</R> <F>er</F> forget it.<F>Um</F> <F>mm</F>. Because I try <F>um</F> many fortunetellers, so, maybe, I think I can <F>er</F> figure out which is good and which is bad. <F>Um</F>. And, <F>er</F> if the fortuneteller says something completely different from what happened or <F>er</F> for my character, <F>mm</F> maybe I wouldn't believe it.<F>Hm</F>. Yes.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F> my.Thank you for <OL>this interview</OL>.<F>Er</F>. Maybe, I have a dinner after that.Yes. Maybe, somewhere around this area.<F>Err</F>. I'm not sure, but <F>um</F> I just saw the <F>er</F> Chinese restaurant around <F>er</F> this area. And, maybe, we can try that. <nvs>sniff</nvs><F>Oh</F>. Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.Thank you.
