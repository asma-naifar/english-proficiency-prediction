My name is . Please call me .
. I live in .
 it's Ward.
. Yes. it's famous for .
But there are a lot of local people, other than students. And it's very handy to go to or to other areas. . Yes.
. I take Line.
Yes.
It can leads to everywhere.
 yes one of the supermarket is open until one o'clock. .
.
And there are other convenience stores around the area. So, yes, it is very convenient.
No, I live by myself.
. I have to cook dinner, even if I work late. And also, I have to clean the room. It's very small though, you know, even if I'm very tired on weekends. But, anyhow, I enjoy living by myself, yeah.
No, my parents live in south Kyusyu. So it's far away. . And, yeah, they haven't been to my place yet.
.
Yes, I do.
. I work at the administration department in the foreign law firm.
Exactly? Yes, my main job is towards the human resources and other administrative works. . So I have to arrange personnel, recruiting people and coordinating temp staff, if necessary.
.
 . I go out with my close friends over the weekends or if I feel like staying home, I just relax at home over listening to music or, in these days, I try aromatherapy. 
Aromatherapy is like you use essential oil or candles with fragrance so that it makes you really feel relaxing.
. You can buy anywhere in the city, I think. .
 tell you right now, but there are a lot of shops selling those essential oils.
.
.
Right. . Yes. . One of the girl is sitting in her room. And P C is on the desk in front of her. And typewriter is on the desk as well. And, at the center of the room, there is a dog. And, on the right-hand side, there is a cat on the bed. Door is open. she has a stereo on the shelves which contains a lot of books, and telephone near the door. . The calendar is on the wall over the stereo. On the left-hand side, there is a clock and window with a brown curtain which is open.
. No, my room is not as .
Yes. . And I have no space for such a big desk. But I have a bed and a small table and T V near the window.
Good place? . Actually, I've been in for nearly two years, but I'm not really familiar with the areas in different places. So, maybe, I ask one of the agency. Actually, I found current place through the agency, too. And she is really good. The person in charge was very kind, and I can just give her all information I want. And she could arrange almost everything. . So I might try that way again.
Which one to take? . First of all, whether it's convenient for commuting or not. Secondly, . more importance to the window facing to the big road, or with the window just close to the another .
So, in that case, I wouldn't take it.
 Yes.
.

O K.
Hello? This is speaking.
. How are you?

Yeah. I'm .
Thank you.
 the party then.
. you mean, I missed the party?
Yes. Actually, one of my friend was waiting for me in the restaurant by herself. And I was supposed to be there, but yeah, I really couldn't make it, because my boss asked me to do some job. And I mean, which I wasn't expected. And I couldn't say "No.". So, in that case, I rang her at the restaurant. . She's already had small amount of meal on the table. And she said, ".". Yeah, she was a bit upset. But, after that, I explained her and how I was and what the situation was. So she understood.
And, yeah, I made it up . So, then, it was O K.
Mostly? . when you are required, you cannot say "No.". but, although you cannot say "No." to your boss. I mean, for example, the job offered to you, you .
But I want to have a policy of my job. So, maybe, say, even if my boss said to do this or that, or if something will happen in the future, I might tell my boss, because I might know my work better than he or she does. .
.
O K.

And, in the end, the bike was taken away from which truck arranged by police department. And watching it the bike was watching it.

No, I don't. I don't have license either.
. It's very stupid things, but I went to a fortuneteller long time ago. And I was told not to have driver's license. It's sound very stupid. .
. I was told that if I drove a car, I might have killed somebody in a traffic accident. So I didn't want it to happen.
. Usually, I don't. But, in this case, it involves somebody's life. So, yes. I was very scared.
 then, I can do without a .
In fortune telling?
. If it's forget it.
 . Because I try many fortunetellers, so, maybe, I think I can figure out which is good and which is bad. . And, if the fortuneteller says something completely different from what happened or for my character, maybe I wouldn't believe it.
. Yes.
