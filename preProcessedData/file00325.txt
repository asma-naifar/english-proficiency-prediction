And <F>em</F> it was <SC>a tai</SC> <SC>ai</SC> at the toilet. The bathroom was a tiny room. <F>Em</F> <F>em</F> <F>ah</F>. <SC>Bi</SC> <F>oh</F> what can I say, <R>bi</R> behind the toilet, there was a little shelf, and I had a little bottle of a perfume. And, for some reason, by accident, the bottle <F>em</F> dropped inside of the toilet. <SC>And I</SC> <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> <R>and</R> and the land owner lives on beneath. And I called her up and asked her, if <F>i</F> she can do something about it, because <R>the</R> the <R>toile</R> toilet were not flush. It will take some time to flush. And I was afraid if the water would come up, <R>and</R> and <F>eh</F> the floor would be flooded. But <F>em</F> the <SC>land ow</SC> landlady told me <SC>that</SC> <F>eh</F> to wait until <SC>tomorrow</SC> <F>er</F> next morning. So I said O K. And, around midnight, <SC>I</SC> all of the sudden, <R>I</R> I heard the sound <F>eh</F> of the knocking, "<?>pang and pang</?>". And I went to the door, and there was a lady and her husband <R>with</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> with a bucket. <R>And</R> and <F>er</F> <?>to go to with and</?>, <F>er</F> <?>close</?>. And I was living on the fourth floor, and <SC>what she</SC> what they told me was that <nvs>laughter</nvs> the ceiling <SC>on the seco</SC> on the third floor was broken down <laughter>because</laughter> the water went down to the third floor.So <F>er</F> that was what happened. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>that</laughter> was terrible.<F>Mhm-hum</F>.<OL><F>Mhm-hum</F></OL>.<F>Em</F>. Last week, a gentleman was on his way to his company. And there is other man, a young man who was <R>on</R> on the bike, <F>em</F> talking on the portable telephone <SC>to her</SC> to his girlfriend. And, at some corner, <F>oh</F> I think that <SC>they are</SC> the man <SC>who was going on</SC> who was on his way to his workplace in a automobile was turning to the left. And, at that point, <F>em</F> <SC>he or the</SC> the rider of the bike hit and there was an accident. <R>And</R> and rider of the bike dropped his <F>em</F> <F>em</F> mobile telephone. And there was an arguments between these two <SC>men</SC> gentlemen. <F>Em</F>. <SC>They</SC> the rider of the bike <SC>was accusing</SC> seems to be <F>eh</F> <SC>accuding</SC> accusing <F>er</F> the rider of the automobile because of the <F>er</F> damage <R>that</R> that his bike received and the damage <SC>of the</SC> of his mobile telephone. <F>Em</F>. Naturally, what happened in a number five because <F>em</F> <R>I don't</R> <SC>I don't seem</SC> <R>I don't</R> I don't believe that <SC>the damage</SC> <SC>you can</SC> <SC>you can't</SC> you can use the damage telephone to call up the police. But police is there <R>and</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> and trying to hear the story <R>from the</R> <F>eh</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>em</F> from the driver <R>of the</R> of the car who seemed to have hit the bike.
