. My name is . How are you?
Yeah.
Me, too.
Yes.
 I'm living in  . It's  now lying on a  Line.   it take one and half hour from my place to here.
. Yeah. Yeah.
.
No,   with my husband, and I live in  company's house.
Yeah.
.  how the? . . So so. 
 I mean  we have a three houses which I could  select the house so we looked  on the houses, and then we talked talk, talk, talk, about  around the some  convenience or  traffic or like  many things. And then  we decided to live the company house in .  it was the best choice, I guess. But  my husband always complained because   his office is little bit far from my home. So he always you know,   has to ride on a very  crowded train, and then   every morning, he has to leave for work  half past seven or very early morning. So  we are thinking about move to another place. But  you know company house is very cheap and very  large place so.  It's all right, yes. Maybe in couple of years  we will live there.
.  What I do?  . Now I'm just  housewife. I don't work. I just go to like   hobby or fitness gym or something like that.  I'm looking for a   job  which I think suit for me. But   just  very hard because  many of company set the limit of age. And then    I haven't asked the company yet, but  maybe  if I send my application or something like that, maybe the company thought I was just    older than other people who want to job. So  yeah, I try to find.
.  Yeah.
Yeah.
. Pretty pictures.
.
?
All right. . This is  the girl's room. She has  one cat and one dog. And then  she is sitting in front of  her desk     which is    computer is on. And then  also she has a    no, no, no, C D cassette player with  speakers. And then  I guess it was June because I can see in a calendar of the June. Then  at nine o'clock, I don't know in a morning or in a night, but   the clock said so. And    I don't know actually what she is doing. Maybe she shows her screen to the someone or  her cats or . But  she just looks like  introduce something to someone. And  she also has a typewriter on a desk. And  she has her own phone on a shelf. .   . It's all right?
No. . No.   no.
No.
Yes, I have.
  I think   it's a good machine to make communication with a person who lived in very far from here   like another country. Why I think so because I have been in Australia for three years. At that time,  I thought  international call  was very expensive. But  if I use a computer to send a  e-mail or  something, it's a very easy to very cheap. So  at that time, I thought " It's very great system.". .   mei just to send a letter, you know,  couple minutes or something. So just it cost  maybe one dollar or  half dollar or, I'm not sure. . Yeah.
Yap.
Yap.
.  . It's very hard.  .  It is as for past?  I call you just before the party or just after the party?
All right.  .
O K.
Yap.

So  I wanted to call you, but   policeman didn't want me to  call someone because  I was  involved in a  very bad   car accident. So I had to  sit  in front of desk to describe what happened or what I was doing. So  I'm so sorry   you know, I'm just  came home, and then now I was about to call you     what it happened.

One day last week. All right. . One day,   maybe  two girls, maybe they are friends,  had a plan to go camping.  then        they very ready to go. And then they go to the riverbank. Then    they set a tent to sleep in a night. And then  they had cooked     dinner for the night. But  at that time,  the one of girl noticed the rain started. But another girl, she said  it's all right because  maybe you know, it's  like a little accident. It usually happen. So it's all right we keep going. But  after few minutes, it's a strong wind    no, no, . And then their tent  collapsed.   was     no, no, no, very strong wind and very heavy rain started so they decided to   in to the car  until  the weather   will settle. Then but  the weather  still went crazy so      they  gave up their plan on camping on a riverbank. And then  they went back to their place. But on a lightning and a heavy rain    still was going  and they very panicked. They very hard to go back to their home. So  one of  girls found a hotel on the road so they decide to  stay there  until   weather would change. And then they entered a very comfortable room.  they took showers, and they  had a  couple of teas. At that time,   the weather changed. Then  they could see  very   fine weather so they very  disappointed.
