<F>Uh</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. How are you?Yeah.Me, too.Yes.<F>Uh</F> I'm living in <F>uh</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. It's <F>uh</F> now lying on a <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Line. <R>It</R> <F>um</F> it take one and half hour from my place to here.<F>Woo</F>. Yeah. Yeah.<CO>So</CO>.No, <SC>my</SC> <F>uh</F> with my husband, and I live in <F>uh</F> company's house.Yeah.<F>Uhm</F>. <F>Ur</F> how the? <F>Uhhh</F>. <F>Uum</F>. So so. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F> I mean <F>uh</F> we have a three houses which I could <F>ur</F> select the house so we looked <SC>our</SC> on the houses, and then we talked talk, talk, talk, about <F>ur</F> around the some <F>uh</F> convenience or <F>ur</F> traffic or like <F>uh</F> many things. And then <R>we decided</R> we decided to live the company house in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <R>It</R> it was the best choice, I guess. But <F>uh</F> my husband always complained because <F>uh</F> <R>his</R> his office is little bit far from my home. So he always you know, <SC>have to</SC> <F>uh</F> has to ride on a very <.></.> crowded train, and then <SC>he</SC> <R>every</R> every morning, he has to leave for work <SC>seven</SC> half past seven or very early morning. So <R>we</R> we are thinking about move to another place. But <F>uh</F> you know company house is very cheap and very <.></.> large place so. <.></.> It's all right, yes. Maybe in couple of years <R>we</R> we will live there.<F>Oh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> What I do? <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F>. Now I'm just <F>ur</F> housewife. I don't work. I just go to like <F>uh</F> <.></.> hobby or fitness gym or something like that. <R>I'm</R> I'm looking for a <R>wor</R> <SC>work</SC> job <SC>which I s</SC> which I think suit for me. But <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> just <F>uh</F> very hard because <F>uh</F> many of company set the limit of age. And then <R>I</R> <.></.> <R>I</R> I haven't asked the company yet, but <F>uh</F> maybe <SC>the</SC> if I send my application or something like that, maybe the company thought I was just <F>uh</F> <SC>older</SC> <R>ol</R> older than other people who want to job. So <F>uum</F> yeah, I try to find.<F>Huum</F>. <.></.> Yeah.Yeah.<F>Uh</F>. Pretty pictures.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<CO>You mean I explain the</CO>?All right. <F>Urm</F>. This is <F>uh</F> the girl's room. She has <F>uuuh</F> one cat and one dog. And then <R>she</R> she is sitting in front of <SC>the</SC> her desk <R>which</R> <.></.> <R>which</R> <.></.> which is <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>the computer on</SC> computer is on. And then <SC>she</SC> also she has a <F>uhm</F> <SC>music</SC> <F>uh</F> no, no, no, C D cassette player with <F>uh</F> speakers. And then <F>mmmm</F> I guess it was June because I can see in a calendar of the June. Then <F>ur</F> at nine o'clock, I don't know in a morning or in a night, but <F>uh</F> <R>the</R> the clock said so. And <F>uhm</F> <SC>she</SC> <R>I don't</R> I don't know actually what she is doing. Maybe she shows her screen to the someone or <SC>some</SC> her cats or <laughter>some something</laughter>. But <SC>she's</SC> she just looks like <F>uh</F> introduce something to someone. And <F>uh</F> she also has a typewriter on a desk. And <F>uh</F> she has her own phone on a shelf. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Uh</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>. It's all right?No. <F>Urr</F>. No. <SC>Just</SC> <F>uh</F> no.No.Yes, I have.<F>Well</F> <F>uhm</F> I think <SC>it is adv</SC> <F>uh</F> it's a good machine to make communication with a person who lived in very far from here <SC>like in a</SC> <.></.> like another country. Why I think so because I have been in Australia for three years. At that time, <R>I</R> I thought <SC>it's a</SC> international call <SC>is</SC> was very expensive. But <F>uh</F> if I use a computer to send a <SC>mail</SC> e-mail or <R>some</R> something, it's a very easy to very cheap. So <.></.> at that time, I thought "<F>Oh</F> It's very great system.". <F>Huum</F>. <SC>Just you know <SC>send a <SC>letter</SC> <F>uh</F> mei</SC> <F>uh</F> write a letter</SC> just to send a letter, you know, <R>couple</R> couple minutes or something. So just it cost <F>mm</F> maybe one dollar or <R>half</R> half dollar or, I'm not sure. <CO>But</CO>. Yeah.Yap.Yap.<F>Huh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Ugh</F>.
