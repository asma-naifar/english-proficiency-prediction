 everyday.  I   eat dinner  in the outside of the restaurant  .
I don't like this kind of restaurant because  these restaurant is very expensive.  and  I cannot feel relaxation in this kind of .
 I think eating at home is better than eating     outside.  but     my job is busy, so if I   eat dinner in the dormitory, it's very late at night. So I  would be fat. It's not  healthy I think, so I will go to dinner near the company  around seven o'clock.

After, they  went back to  each home.
 I like both,    when  I'd like to see the movie at big screen in the theater,  I go to the movie with some girl   friends.
