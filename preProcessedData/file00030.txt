Actually <R>I</R> I go to school five times <F>mm</F> a week, so <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>I</SC> <R>on</R> on Sunday <SC>I stay</SC> I always stay at home <R>to</R> to read a book or to watch the T V or to listen the music or <F>umm</F> <R>if</R> <R>if I</R> if I have a free time <F>um</F> <R>after</R> after the class <R>I</R> I meet some friends or go for shopping.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Ah</F>.
