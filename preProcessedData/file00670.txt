The moment when I can't explain why we use this particle, and why we don't use that particle because <laughter>you know</laughter>, we use Japanese <R>without</R> <F>uh</F> without thinking about such explanation so.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urr</F> I usually read a book, something like book. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Like a novel.

So yeah.<F>Ur</F> I prefer living in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <?>Because</?> <SC><H pn="others4">XXX05</H></SC> living in <R>To</R> <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> is so noisy, and yeah.I don't like big city so. I prefer<OL>living in</OL> <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>.Yes. There'll be no problem if I stay here all the time. But I have to go out sometimes so.

Every time I use a plane, I oversleep. So I have to run around the airport to find the air ticket center. So yeah, I always have a problem when I use a plane.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Because I can't finish packing. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I have to stay all night. But I can't stay all night, and I go to bed, and I find myself oversleep so. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urr</F>. Fortunately, <SC>I've never</SC> <F>ur</F> I'm always on time. But I have to run around the air port. <F>Mm</F>.<F>Ur</F>. One day last week, me and my friends <R>were</R> were planning to go camping to Nagano. And <R>we</R> we did a camp by the river side. But in the afternoon, it stopped raining heavily. <SC>We</SC> and we have to go inside a car. And while we were planning to go home, we found a hotel.

And yeah, I took <SC>a train</SC> the first train to the <SC>mount</SC> <F>ur</F> station near the mountain. And I climbed that mountain.<F>Urr</F>. <SC><R>It is</R> it is good because we don't have to pay attention to <F>um</F> <??></??></SC> it's good because <R>we</R> we can stay anywhere <SC>if</SC> as far as we have a sleeping bag. So that's the good point. But the bad point is that we have to carry the sleeping bag and tent. So it's quite heavy. So it makes us very tired. So that's the bad point I think.<F>Urr</F>. <F>Mm-mm</F>. <.></.> Any secret, <R>I</R> I don't think so. <R>Just</R> just try to <laughter>carry</laughter>.<F>Mm</F> I have to finish my report, writing a report. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Tomorrow.
