But a little bit tired.
. My major is teaching languages. So I'm studying how to teach Japanese to foreigners.
. Because I was living in dormitory, and I was sharing a room with the foreigner students. So sometimes I taught Japanese to them. Yeah. So that's why I got interested in the teaching Japanese to foreigners.
 . The moment when I can't explain why we use this particle, and why we don't use that particle because , we use Japanese without thinking about such explanation so.

 I usually read a book, something like book. 
Like a novel. Like a detective thing. Yeah. Or essays.
. A novel written by Endou Shusaku.
. Because though his topic is very serious, he make that serious topic a very, you know, simple. So yeah, I like his book.
Yeah. But I'm planning to move out now.
. Because I'm bit busy. So I can't stay there. But I have to stay there as a member of dormitory. So I decided to move out. 
. . .
. It's a very big city. And it's very near to or . So there're lots of people from Asian countries. So it's like international city. But I'm living a bit far from the center of . So yeah.
 I prefer living in . is so noisy, and yeah.
I don't like big city so. I prefer

I cook myself usually. Yes.
Yes.
I have my own kitchens and refrigerator so there is no problem cooking myself so.
You mean moving out of dormitory, or living ?

I don't have to, you know, think about what I have to do. Or I can do whatever I want to do so. Yeah, it's very comfortable.
. This is a picture of a room of a girl. Maybe a junior high or high school student. And she's sitting in front of computer. And there's two animals. One is a cat on a bed. And the other is a dog which is beside a bed. . The door is opened. And there's a big old type stereo. . There's a clock on a wall. And there's a orange curtain. And I don't know what she is trying to do. But yeah, and she has her own telephone. And it's June.
Yeah.
You mean mobile phone?
Yes, I have.
. It's very convenient because I can receive any phone call wherever I am. Yeah. So it's very convenient. But the probably it's cost very much for me. And sometimes I have to take a phone call even though I don't want to. So sometimes it interrupt me. So yeah, it have some advantages and some disadvantages. 
Yes, I'm ready.
. Will you do me a favor for me? I got a reservation for the train which is just left.
And I want to have my money back. And I want to have a new reservation for the next train.
. . But because I was tried to be on time. But my bus got the traffic jam. So I couldn't be on time here. So it's not my fault.
But I use a J R bus.
So it's your company. 
. But there's the accident. So it's an unexpectable thing. .
A car accident. So that's why there is a big traffic jam.
Yes.
. Maybe it's because it just happened a thirty minutes ago. So maybe the news hasn't been reached to you yet.
O K. but I have to go to Nagoya by eleven.
And I have to take the next train, but I don't have a extra money for new ticket.

. Every time I use a plane, I oversleep. So I have to run around the airport to find the air ticket center. So yeah, I always have a problem when I use a plane.
 Because I can't finish packing. So I have to stay all night. But I can't stay all night, and I go to bed, and I find myself oversleep so. 
. Fortunately, I'm always on time. But I have to run around the air port. .
. One day last week, me and my friends were planning to go camping to Nagano. And we did a camp by the river side. But in the afternoon, it stopped raining heavily. and we have to go inside a car. And while we were planning to go home, we found a hotel. So we stayed there for a night.

And I slept in front of Matsumoto Station at night with my sleeping bag. And yeah, I took the first train to the station near the mountain. And I climbed that mountain.
. it is good because we don't have to pay attention to it's good because we can stay anywhere as far as we have a sleeping bag. So that's the good point. But the bad point is that we have to carry the sleeping bag and tent. So it's quite heavy. So it makes us very tired. So that's the bad point I think.
. . I don't think so. just try to .
