All right.   O K. .   this is     one young woman's room.    there is one dog and one cat. And   young lady is sitting  near the desk. And  on the desk  there is a typewriter  and  computer.   and  she has    stereo set and telephone and then   that's all. .
.
All right.     the biggest difference is  the floor.  this floor is carpet, and     the floor on my house is  ,     and also  this room is very clean but my room is very  nasty. .

 I have    ticket. That is   reserved  the last train.   but     I couldn't  get on the train.  so could you change to the ticket  to next train?
  but   I paid before.     but I  don't ride on. So ,  you don't lose money. So  you can  change the ticket.
Yeah.        yeah that's right.    but   the next train  I think, there are many  vacancies so  it doesn't matter. So  could you change  the ticket?
 because    my mother  got trouble so   I had to go to the hospital. So,  it's very emergency reason. So,  it's inevitable.  so  this is  special  reason.
