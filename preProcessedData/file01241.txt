And <SC>I have</SC> <F>urm</F> I take classes for four hours then I have lunch. And I have <F>urm</F> three more classes. And then <SC>after</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> sorry, after that, I have school activity which is track and field.Yeah.<F>Urm</F> I am a manager.Yeah. I support <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> the runners and <OL>stuff</OL>.Yeah.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL> <F>Oh</F>.Because <SC?>I'll</SC?> I don't know. Because my friend was a manager.And I came to this school <F>um</F> in September.Not in April.Yeah. So <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>my</SC> one of my friends invited me there.<OL>That's one of</OL> the reason. But the other reason is because, I don't know, <R>I</R> I guess I love the jobs of managers.Yeah, supporting people.Yeah, I love doing that. <CO>So</CO>.Yes.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL>Because</OL> I finished <F>urm</F> middle school <R>in</R> in the States.And then yeah, after I finished schools there, I came back here.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.Because of my dad's job.<OL>Yes</OL>. <SC>He does</SC> <F>urm</F> he is a <SC>computer enr</SC> <R>com</R> computer engineer.And he <?>has</?> projects with the <F>urm</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.So I went there for five years.Yeah.Yes.<OL><F>Well</F></OL> at first, I couldn't speak English <SC>so</SC> but I entered a private schoolthere. That was <F>urm</F> my dad's idea. But there were no Japanese <F>uh</F> <F>urm</F> so <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I learned English <R>from</R> <F>ur</F> from, I don't know, speaking with my friends. <SC>I didn't really</SC> I wasn't really taught byteachers.The grammarsand stuff. But I learned by listening and speaking.<F>Urm</F> this is probably in high school. The teacher's teaching <SC>math</SC> mathematic to students, but none of the students <SC>listens</SC> listen to the teacher. <.></.> <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> but a boy in blond hair and a girl with brown hair is listening to the teacher. <F>Urm</F> shall I describe all the other <OL>students</OL>?<F>Oh</F> back in the States.<F>Urm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> back in the States, <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> most of the students listened to the teachers.Not like the people in the picture.Because <R>we</R> we were not allowed to drink or <R>chew</R> chew gumor talk with other students in the classroom.I think <R>it's</R> it's a really good idea.Because <SC>if there were no any</SC> if there weren't any strict restrictions,<F>urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>the teachers</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>well</F> I feel bad for the teachers. And also it's no good for the students because the school is a place for learning, I think. <OL>That's my opinion</OL>.But yeah. Yes. <nvs>cough</nvs>So.<OL>in</OL> Japan?<F>Well</F> <SC>Japanese</SC> I think Japanese schools are more strict than <F>ur</F> in America because we hardly ever hear other students talk in class. It's really quiet all the time. And I think the <R>Jap</R> <F>ur</F> Japanese teachers point to the students. If we were doing math, they would point to the students <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> to do the problems. And I don't know, <SC>it's</SC> Japanese students <SC>particimate</SC> participate more in a class.Yeah.<F>Oh</F> I read this?<OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.O K.O K. <SC>I</SC> <.></.> can I make up <F>urm</F> a story?O K. <F>Ur</F> I bought this <F>ur</F> gloves, but <R>I</R> I didn't really like it.So <R>can I</R> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <nvs>sigh</nvs> can I <.></.> refund?<F>Oh</F> <R>I</R> I know about the policy, but I think I will never wear <SC>this</SC> <SC>tho</SC> these gloves. So can I refund, please?<F>Well</F> at first, <F>urm</F> <R>I didn't</R> I didn't try <SC>this</SC> these on, and I bought it.<OL>So</OL> the size <SC>don</SC> <SC>do</SC> don't fit my hands.And I don't like the colorsof the gloves. So I'm hoping to refund.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. Yes. But <F>urm</F> if I can, <R>I</R> I want to refund.<F>Oh</F>. Then <F>urm</F> I will come back later.Yes. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><laughter>O K, <OL>thank you</OL></laughter>.Yeah.Yes, <OL>many</OL> times.<OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Well</F> it happen all the time in America.<OL><SC>I</SC></OL> because refund is a common thingin American than in Japan.So I don't know, like, <SC>if I buy</SC> <F>well</F> I bought jeans. But the length of the jeans didn't fit my legs so I refund it. But it was no problem.And <F>well</F> when I came to Japan, I <R>wen</R> went to <F>ur</F> refund something I forget, but <SC>they wouldn't</SC> <F>ur</F> they didn't let me refund.<OL>So</OL> <OL>I was surprised</OL>.<F>Ah</F>. <.></.> I don't know. I'm not sure, but I think it's because <F>urm</F> if you refund, <F>urm</F> most of the time, it's like ripped or it's damaged and some kinds. So <F>ur</F> <R>they don't</R> they don't want the damaged stuff back.And I think it's the <F>ur</F> consumer's responsibility.<SC>So</SC> but I don't know why Americans will let buyers refund.<OL><laughter>I don't know</laughter> <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>. <??></??><OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.Do I begin now?One day last week, my sister and I decided to go camping.
