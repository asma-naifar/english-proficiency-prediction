  . When I was a college student, I went to India and Nepal with my friend. I  went there without any plans. We just,   the airplane ticket and get on the  New Delhi air port. I don't know where to stay. I don't know where is. .  we also didn't have  a guide book, either. So  we traveling around India and Nepal about two month.
It's very  interesting trip.
. Hot, hot.
India. Especially, India, temperature gets up around forty-five in the daytime. And the temperature   still stays,  thirty-five or thirty-six in the night. So  I feel like I'm living in a sauna.
. Yes, yes.
In the future. I'm asking my wife to go there together, but  she doesn't want.
Because   she doesn't   like  hot place or dirty place. .
You're welcome.
.
.    when I was walking along the street   last week No, no, no. One day last week,   I had a dinner with my father. And  he knew a very nice restaurant, so we went the restaurant together. And we enjoyed lunch, and  we ate a lot.  So  I didn't have enough money to pay that. My father  paid everything. I was very lucky. So, after the lunch,  we  say good-bye. And   I think I had a good lunch. That's all.
 . India,    they have  many kinds of menu,    due to the religious reason. There are many  vegetarians and  Christian. And   they have different menus. . And also,    if you go to the nice restaurant, you get nice service. But, if you go to  like    the very cheap restaurant,  you get bad service. I recommend you to go to the nice restaurant.
. Nice service?      a waiter always comes to the table and ask me,  "Is everything O K?" and "Do you need more water?" or, they ask me   a lot of questions. So I don't have to call the waiter. .
.
You're welcome.
.
Yes. .
. Not in the morning. 
 from the afternoon, I start working. In the morning, I'm free.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
