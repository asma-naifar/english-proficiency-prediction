So  we have a few boys. So just choose it, and pick him up and tell him, "Please, please, please act the boy

. .   when I was in eighth grade, the city has a program of acting  like  just trying. But like N G O,    anyway,
N G O  offered us to do acting with professional teacher.
Then I  attended it.
I took a part in it. And I found that acting fun.
And we had so many performance at of course in Tokyo, and in Mie
and others  cities.
Then I got more interested in acting.
 the teacher like  director
was really really,  it's bad word, but abnormal.
He was really special and he was  like how do I say, but anyway, he has his own world. And that was really, really interesting.

And  a teacher,   maybe she is teaching  function.
Yeah. And there's, one, two, three, four, five, six,   no, six students. . . And  one is  not talking on the cell phone, but maybe E-mailing on the cell phone. And two girls are talking about their fashion. And they paint on their nails and they wear too much make up. 
And one is listening to music and drinking during class. .
 it's bad. But our class is like .
Not chewing a bubble gum, but yeah, talking, talking, talking, and someone is drinking and  some students are yeah, E-mailing on the cell phone.
Why?
 just look. They don't face to their teachers,
 talking or just look other side.
I don't think they are concentrating on the math class.
Environment?
  . One is concentrated. So maybe that's  just because of the subject. 
   .
.
Yes.
So  do you want to ask me about   our class,  it is depends on a subject or environment?
.
Yes. Like  yeah, actually we are really busy so   we need to do study and we need to do other things. But some student can't control it.
So like doing homework during this class,  doing other subject's class or they need   sleeping at the class. And  yeah, some are just talking or E-mailing on their cell phone because it's not fun.
Thank you.
No.
Sometimes, .

O K. 
O K.
 I just want to take this back.  But   I went to home, and I open it. But actually I don't like it so will you exchange it into,  is it into money?
 yeah. .
Yes.
 but  you know,    for customer, I think  it's the best thing to do the best thing.
Like, no,  if you can or if you could, just exchange it. Why not? 
 but  what's the problem?   it's on the sale and what's the problem?
.
.
. But  if it was not on holidays,
will you exchange it?
 then  it's O K to  exchange into the normal price, not special. But I just want to give it back. Is it O K?
 and ask the manager?
Thank you.
I'm stubborn. 
.
Yes.  maybe,  one, two, three, four times.
 no.  just .
So no, I've never had such a test. 
O K. That's fine.
O K. I've been to Singapore, Korea and America.
 been to America twice.
 winter I went there. And I went to Oregon, one of the State,   north of the California and south of the Seattle.
Seattle is State? No.
Washington?  yeah.
 I went there because my friend was there and just see my friends.
I met them  two or three years ago. I went Oregon  just learning languages. And I went there and I stayed at dormitory   of college. And  fourteen companion  came there, and  helped us     to have a life
safely and  yeah, safely and  like do not bad thing. And yeah,  then one of the companion was really, really kind and   we became friends and just keep in touch for  three years. And she asked me to come her home.
So, "O K, then I will go.". But I went there and   I had stayed with them for two weeks.
. Yes. .
 is that last thing?
Is it O K to begin now?
O K.   one day last week, a man  use the station. And it was   and eight o'clock, maybe it's in the morning. But anyway,  he was wanting to get on the train. But man accidentally attacked him. And he dropped his suitcase.  and they started arguing, but both of them could do nothing because  the suitcase is on the railways. And suddenly, the train   came and the man was surprised because it might be crashed. And then the train was gone and that suitcase was safe. And he is relieved. And    maybe that's  officer at station, came down to the railways and took it and give him back.
What would I do?    it's bad but I'll take it by myself, like,  going on  like railways and take it and go up 
.
 . But I'll do that.
Yes,  everyday.

But maybe next year  leader.
