And, maybe, I hope to be <SC>comsen</SC> compensated <SC>with</SC> in some kind of form.Yes.Yes, it was a cruise around the world. And <SC>I said</SC> they said we could experience lots of <R>si</R> <F>ah</F> sightseeings without optional fee. But, actually, <SC>your schedule</SC> the trip schedule was a little bit tight. And we have not much options to look out during our stay in the course. So, compared with your <SC>as</SC> advertisement <SC?>to</SC?>, we cannot understand why the service was so poor and different with your original's plan.Yes, we did.
