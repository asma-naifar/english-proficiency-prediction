O K. .  One day last week,    a man and  his girlfriend is  walking on the street and  it was rain day.    and a man  heard the    voice of  a cat. And  the cat was    putted by the  road. And   a  girlfriend     thought  the cat was pretty so she want to keep  that. But    a man  forbidden to keep.  But  a girlfriend  want to keep cat. And  boy  was    troubled,  but  at last, allowed to keep the cat and   go  to home with that cat.
.
.
.  What?
   .
.
.
   the most   need is  give a dog  love      and     dog cannot live alone. So   you have to    stay home   at least    half a day.
    and     you don't have to give dog a delicious food.
.
Because  if  dog eat delicious food,  dog never eat  cheap  dog food.
 so     it will be expensive for you.
.
  that is my mother.
.
   . 
.

. But this winter vacation,  maybe I can't go.

No, no.
I am junior at university,
so I have to     find  future job.
So  maybe I'm busy
 in winter vacation.
