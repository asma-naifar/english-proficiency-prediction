     a man  is drinking wine. And a waiter  is  recommending  some special wine, maybe.  and there is piano. And a woman is playing the piano. .
.
 I prefer to eating at home.
Why?        maybe  I can feel relaxed at home. And   I don't have good manners.
So  I don't like eating at restaurants  very much.  That's why.
What kind of food? Yeah. Anything is O K. But I especially like    beef or    meat or something like that. .

Story?
.
.

O K. 
. Me?
Yes. .
  one day last week, I went to a department store to go shopping.
And then,  I   went to the   tie shop.
     I looked for good necktie,
for my dad.
   yeah,   because   my dad's  birthday is next week.
 it was  three thousand yen.
And I asked the sales clerk to  wrap it up.
And then,   after buying  necktie,   I happened to find    final sale section.  the   shoes and clothes are very cheap.
  there,  they have thirty percent  or fifty percent discount.
And     I looked around    the section. And finally,      I bought    three    package of clothes and shoes.
.
Big departments?
. In big  department store,   we can easily find what we want.
. And most of the case, the service in big department stores are better than      smaller  shops.
And  in big department stores,   we can feel  more excited.    I don't know why. . 
That's maybe good point.
.
 today?  actually, to tell the truth,  I have class now. 
Yeah.   second period. I have second period class. And so after finishing this  exam,  I will run to,
 the building fourteen,
in the campus.

.
 very much.
