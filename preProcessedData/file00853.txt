Good morning. This is .
.
Nice to see you.
Yes, I'm quite busy.
Actually, I worked in control department since January.
So I'm bit new in this department.
And, now we have many project.
So I'm quite busy.
Control department includes the financial department and general things and human resources.
So, three functions.
?
 this weekend, I went to see my friends.
 we talk about the family things.
And, one of my friends.
She is kind of my good adviser.
Yeah.
. So one of my friends, she is she is older than me, a little bit.
And he has her husband.
 husband. 
Not to handle but how to live with
husband in good way.
.
 just we talk about not problem, but the things we had recently. . we had dinner.
And we had some drinks.
. Actually, Kichijoji is .
She lives in, the sorry, Inogashira Line.
I live in Yurakucho Line.
And Kichijoji is a nice place
to get together.
.
 .
.
Actually I live in Nishi-Ogikubo next to Kichijoji, so I know Kichijoji well. But that was about ten years ago.
So, compared with that, now is a bit crowded,
.
.
 the atmosphere is more classical, or there are many jazz spots or something. So I thought Kichijoji is good place to dating
 with the couples.
I mean, we call it date spot sometimes, the good place to lovers, I think. it was a bit romantic. But, nowadays, many younger generation come to Kichijoji, so the place becomes vivid a bit 
 noisy, I think.
.
Yes.
 many young people.
.
.
O K.
Yes, this is my room. I'm sitting in the chair. in front of me, there are sometimes I do work at home on weekend because I'm quite busy, and I have a lot of work. And I think it's good to do the job listening to the radio or listening to the classical music. I like to listen to music, so I had nice stereo component. now, I mean, I raise a cat and a dog. My cat is lying on the bed. . My dog is sitting on the floor.
Thank you.
 sometimes, because, like I said, relaxed I mean, at home, I feel relaxed. And some work, it is better to do the job relaxed atmosphere and nobody disturbs me.
So, in certain work, I think it's better to do not the better, but it's, maybe, good to do the job at home.
 some kind of job should be done in the office, which should be discussed with other people
or something.
.
O K.
O K.

So, ring-ring.
Hello, this is .

 I'm very sorry, yeah. I know that you kindly invited me to the dinner
the other day, but I'm very sorry I have to cancel the party.
Because my daughter had awfully cold, so I have to take care of my daughter.
 I'm very sorry, but my husband had to go to his office.
He had to do the job at office,
today.
So I couldn't ask him to take care of my daughter.

Yeah. my part is to prepare for the panel.
Actually, party was the farewell party for our management people.

so we had to organize the party.
And one or two gentleman in the control department did camera at the party. And another colleague video recorder.
And, of course, at the beginning of the party, my colleague and I played the reception role.
I think so.

O K. One day last week, my husband and I went shopping. on that day, we had a lot of rain. we found some sound. we looked around, and we found that the sound came the cardboard at the corner of the street. in the cardboard. she should feel cold because we had quite a lot of rain. and I thought very sorry for her. so maybe someone might left her in the cardboard. I asked my husband whether I could bring a cat to home . First, my husband said, "No way. and I really don't like a cat.". I could not leave her alone, so I asked my husband again. . "Is it O K that I raise the cat until a cat so that she can live up by herself? . I will not go home.", I said to my husband. so, this time, my husband said, "O K, until she grows up.", he said. after I get my husband go-sign, the cardboard. , I brought a cat to my home.
