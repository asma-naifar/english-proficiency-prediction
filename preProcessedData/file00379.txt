Hi.
. My name is .
. It's O K.
 I'm living in  City.
No.  I lived with my family. My family is  four  people. My father and mother and my  little brother.
Yes. He is   twenty-four years old. And now, he is in university student. But  he will be graduate this year.  and now, he is traveling  around  Japan  for graduate travel,
with his friend.
Yes.
 my brother's charming point?
  he is always calm down.
And  his   talk is very    easy to understand for me. And  he is not passionate person. But he is always calm down and make me feel  calm.
Yes. My hobby is maybe  traveling.
Yes. I like  to  go abroad. Of course, I like travel in Japan but   I love travel abroad,  like Europe or some Asia and U S.
Yes. I  went to U S last month.
. Yes. . My friend living in U S, Arizona State. So I visited her and went to the San Francisco. And  with my friend,   we went there for nine days.
  I was very surprised to   see many people eat too much food.
. So many very big popcorn. They  were eating too much. And at the  restaurant, we ordered some  spaghetti   only one. But we  shared it, but the plate was very big and  we couldn't eat all.
.
   .  I had only nine days. I didn't know  so well about their life style.
But      so  at Arizona city,  we went to  see rodeo, some festival.
And there,   they are very excited and  that attitude was very different from Japanese people.
.  I don't know. I hope so. 
Yes.
O K.  There seems  restaurant and two people are      waiting  for their dishes. And     one boy is   show them their   a bottle of wine. And then,   sitting people, two people, one is a lady and the other was a man. The man was talking with the boy.  And then, there is a piano   near the  wall. And  some woman playing the piano. And  there are two table. .   .  
Sorry.
. Yes.
 we usually go to   Japanese restaurant or  family restaurant.
  I think it's looks like  some hotel lounge or  some a little high-class restaurant.
Yes, sometimes.
 but       I go to  like this restaurant with my friend,
maybe.
Who,   when I went with my boyfriend, we  shared the cost. And  we   talking and decide the   the order.
 Because       we are not different in our salaries. And if my boyfriend paid all,    I feel    bad feelings to him.
. O K.
O K.
Yes. I want to go to  New York.  I was very hurry, so I want to go the most     speedy way.
And where can I    buy  my ticket?
. O K.
How much is that?
Five hundred.  it's O K.  when the train will  start? And  when it arrive at New York?
. That's O K.
Can I have one ticket?
Yeah.
    when the local train  arrived at New York?
Almost same hour?
 . Same hour?  .  how much the local train?
One hundred?   I'll choose local train.
Yes,   I'll pay by   cash.
Thanks.
Where is the train?
. Track three. It's O K.
.   actually, no.  we didn't use any train. Only   we ride  cable car in San Francisco.
Because      it's speedy to ride air plane and it's really cheap, the ticket.
. Yes.  every day I use train.
 train?
      I think,  I'm living in  City, so I always use  Line. And  Line is very        I can go to the station and ride just the time.
So  I think it's a good point. But sometime it's a little late.
  recently I think  many times the train was  late. So    I  late .
 it's a trouble.
O K.
.  One day last week.
O K.
  should I describe what happened in this card? .
 one day last week, the woman went to department store to buy a present for her husband.  And  first, she choose a necktie  for her husband's birthday present. And  then,  when she finished to buy the present, she found  the  ladies' shoes were on sale. Thirty-percent off. And then,  she noticed that there is another sale for women's clothes were fifty-percent off. So she bought  a pair of shoes and she bought  her  clothing. Then she went back to her home.
Yes, sometimes.
 .   it depends on my schedule and my friend's schedule. But  I always  go to shopping by alone.
Because    when I  go with my friend,    we take a much time. But if I  go to shopping by alone, I can decide five minutes  ten minutes. I like shopping, but  I'm busy recently. So, I don't want to take much time to shopping.
.
.  I really want to do that.  I hope so. But I have a schedule to go back to my  home and dinner with my father and mother. I promised them. So I couldn't go. If you had some time, tomorrow dinner,  why don't you come with me to go. .
Thanks.
