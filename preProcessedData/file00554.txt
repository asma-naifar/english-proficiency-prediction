So it's not too scary or anything.<R>I thi</R> <F>uh</F> I think so. <F>Well</F> I can speak Spanish, so I <?>don't</?> think I'll be using English.<F>Uum</F>. I like traveling. I've been to <F>er</F> many countries like Russia, <F>erm</F> Canada, and New Zealand, Taiwan, and <F>er</F> China, Hong Kong, <??></??> <OL><??></??> like that</OL>.<F>Um</F>. I didn't go there to travel. I was <F>erm</F> member of <F>um</F> Russia's advanced student conference.So I went there to <F>um</F> participate in the conference. <F>Um</F>. I thought it is very different from Japan, because there is no advertisement at all.<SC>Like</SC> <?>let's see</?>. And <F>um</F> <SC>people there</SC> <F>uum</F> <SC>like</SC> Russian people are really different from like foreigners that I used to know. Like Americans <?>and stuff</?>.<laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know. Like <R>they</R> they think stuff in a different <?>ways for</?> some reason. Like they think stuff really like <?>motley</?>. They are pessimistic for some reason.<nvs>laughter</nvs> But, I mean, my impression is that they really like studying. They are hard working people. And <F>um</F> they also had really good command of English, too. Some of them study like three languages or something.Yeah.<laughter><F>Uum</F></laughter>. I don't know what. I <F>um</F> watch movies, <F>um</F> like mainly Hollywood movies. <F>Um</F>. For example, <R>I</R> I went to see like "A I" twice, <laughter>already</laughter>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Beause <F>er</F> I really like it.And <F>um</F> I don't know, but like watching movies in Japan is really expensive. <CO>So</CO>.I go there on like Wednesday like <F>er</F> lady's day.<OL>Like</OL> you can sit <?>there</?> to see it like <F>er</F> <??></??> or something, yeah. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Erm</F>. Yeah. I go to movies like <F>er</F> twice a month or something.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Um</F>. I live in <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>.<F>Um</F>. Twenty minutes by <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> Line from <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>.I'm moving out. I mean, I'm sending off my stuff to my parents. I mean, my family's place which is <?>place</?> in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>.<F>Um</F>. I probably will be working in <F>er</F> <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> from next year. SoI don't think I keep the apartment.Because the human resource people told me that <F>um</F> <R>you</R> you're working in <F>um</F> International Sales Division. You probably <F>er</F> work in Kansai area like <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> or <H pn="others7">XXX10</H>.It's a big difference. <OL><CO><?>Like</?></CO></OL>.Yeah. I prefer <laughter><H pn="others6">XXX09</H>, though</laughter>.Yeah.<F>Well</F> I guess it's <R>nice</R> nice place to live when you are like seventy or something.<OL><laughter>I mean</laughter></OL> <laughter>I don't wanna live in a country side</laughter>.<OL><?><laughter>No</laughter></?></OL>.O K.I think so.<F>Uum</F>. Many people are skiing. And this looks like <F>um</F> mountain, and it's winter. And <F>um</F> there is a coffee shop or something in <.></.> this lodging. And <F>um</F> <F>uum</F> the sky is clear. And <F>um</F> people wearing like really colorful ski wears. And, <F>err</F> I don't know, there is a snowman in a ground. And <F>um</F> <F>um</F> four kids are playing with the snows. And one guy is like falling down on a ski. <F>Erm</F> <F>uum</F> <F>umm</F>. And looks like <F>um</F> <F>um</F> the ski lesson is taking place, yeah. <F>Um</F>. This guy is teaching to <F>er</F> three people how to ski, yeah.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<.></.> <R>I don't</R> I don't know. It's one of those trend stuff. And, <F>er</F> I guess, <F>er</F> like if you wanna playing in the snow, like I think <F>um</F> <.></.> you had only one choice which is skiing. But like because of <F>er</F> snowboarding, like you can do different stuff from other people. So, that's why I think the young Japanese people think it's cool.<F>Um</F>. You know, different from majority of people skiing.So, <F>um</F> you know, young people likes to do different stuff <laughter>from</laughter> like majorities. So I think that that's the reason.No.<.></.> O K.<F>Um</F>. <.></.> <R>I</R> <.></.> <F>um</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I</R> I bought, like a product <F>um</F> from your place, like yesterday. And <R>I</R> <F>um</F> I took it to my place, but <R>I</R> I found out that I didn't like it. And I'm just wondering if I can exchange it.<F>Uum</F>. <R>I</R> I bought a clothes. But it didn't fit me.It was too small.Yes. But <SC>I didn't like</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> I didn't throw away my receipt or anything. And I have receipt here, and I have product. <F>Er</F>. Like <.></.> product tax <.></.> <?>receipt</?> <.></.> like stuff. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<SC>I think it's</SC> I mean, <.></.> <F>um</F> I couldn't do anything because I didn't fit me. And <F>erm</F> like <R>I</R> I couldn't like give it to like <F>erm</F> family or anything. Beause I live by myself. So I really want you to exchange it.Because I was in a hurry. And <F>um</F> <R>I</R> I check the size tag, and it says like medium. So I <?>thought</?> <F>er</F> <?>it</?> <R?>fit me</R?> fit me, but it didn't. So <SC>I don't</SC> <SC>it's not my</SC> I don't think <laughter>it's my</laughter> fault.Yeah. But the size tag said it's medium. <CO>And</CO>.<R>I</R> <SC>I didn't</SC> I mean, I'm small. So like <R>I</R> I normally buy like one or two, size. So I thought the medium would be a little bigger or something. But it didn't fit me. <CO>So</CO>.<..></..> <F>Hmm</F>. Then, <F>um</F> <nvs>tapping</nvs> where is your manager now?O K. Is he coming back?<F>Um</F>. Can I talk to him, <?>then</?>?<F>Uum</F>. I'll come backin a hour or something.O K.No.<F>Uum</F> <.></.> <F>uum</F>. <F>Well</F> I normally like <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>um</F> check <SC>my</SC> the size like <F>er</F> in a fitting room or so. And <F>er</F> I'm really careful about buying stuff. So <SC>I don't usually buy like</SC> <F>um</F> I don't really like buy stuff like I <??></??> something <??></??>. So I haven't been in this situation before.<OL><laughter><??></??></laughter></OL>O K.<.></.> <OL>I think so</OL>.<.></.> <OL>O K</OL>.<F>Um</F> I'm sorry. <F>Um</F>. <CO>One guy, one day last week</CO>. <F>Um</F>. Can I say "I"?<OL>I was</OL> <F>um</F> driving a car. And <F>um</F> <.></.> this guy who's talking on the cell phone riding a bike at the same time came. And <F>um</F> <SC>he</SC> we kinda <.></.> bumped <?>to</?> each other slightly. And <F>um</F> <SC>he</SC> <R>his</R> his cell phone was broke by the shock of the <F>erm</F> bumping. And <F>um</F> <SC>he blamed for me</SC> <??></??> he blamed me for breaking his cell phone. And <F>er</F> we called the police, and I told the policeman that he was actually talking on a cell phone riding a bike at the same time. And <F>um</F> <F>um</F> <??></??> <SC>he</SC> <F>erm</F> the <R>police</R> <.></.> policeman found out that <F>er</F> <SC>he was</SC> <.></.> <SC>it <R>was</R> was</SC> policeman found out that he was the one who should be blamed for. <SC>And</SC> <F>um</F> so the policeman <F>um</F> took his bike, and <F>um</F> <laughter><F>ah</F></laughter> <F>um</F> this guy like riding a bike didn't do anything <R>about it</R> <.></.> about it.<F>Uum</F>. <.></.> I don't like them. I mean, <R>it's</R> it's really annoying. And <F>um</F> like driving a car <F>um</F> <F>er</F> talking on a cell phone at the same time is really dangerous. And harm people <F>erm</F> walking <?>and</?> stuff. And <F>er</F> talking on the cell phone in the train is, I mean, you can answer the phone and like say something like "I will call you back.". <CO>Or</CO>.Briefly. But <SC>it's</SC> that's fine. But like people <R>who</R> who, you know, talks and talks and talks for like twenty minutes or something in a train, that's really like trouble for other passengers, I think.<OL>Woops</OL>. <F>Errm</F> <F>uum</F>. <.></.> <CO>I'm kind of</CO>. <.></.>I am excited.<OL>But I'm</OL> worried because <F>um</F> yen is getting worse and <laughter>worse</laughter>.<nvs>laughter</nvs>It is.
