. My name is .
.
Nice to meet you.
I'm good. I had test this morning. But it was all right.
 trading theory.
. My major is commerce.
.
. I already get a job. . It's .
 Thank you. I will work in International Sales Department.
Yeah. .
. Actually, I'm graduating in September.
 I'm going to to get a certificate in business administration.
. Sixteenth of next month.
Yeah. 
 I have friends there. So it's not too scary or anything.
 I think so. I can speak Spanish, so I think I'll be using English.
. I like traveling. I've been to many countries like Russia, Canada, and New Zealand, Taiwan, and China, Hong Kong, like that.
. I didn't go there to travel. I was member of Russia's advanced student conference.
So I went there to participate in the conference. . I thought it is very different from Japan, because there is no advertisement at all.
 . And Russian people are really different from like foreigners that I used to know. Like Americans .
 they think stuff in a different some reason. Like they think stuff really like . They are pessimistic for some reason.
 But, I mean, my impression is that they really like studying. They are hard working people. And they also had really good command of English, too. Some of them study like three languages or something.
Yeah.
 watch movies, like mainly Hollywood movies. . For example, I went to see like "A I" twice, .
 Beause I really like it.
And I don't know, but like watching movies in Japan is really expensive. .
I go there on like Wednesday like lady's day.
 you can sit to see it like .
. Yeah. I go to movies like twice a month or something.
.
. I live in .
. Twenty minutes by Line from .
I'm moving out. I mean, I'm sending off my stuff to my parents. I mean, my family's place which is in .
. I probably will be working in from next year. So
I don't think I keep the apartment.
Because the human resource people told me that you're working in International Sales Division. You probably work in Kansai area like or .
It's a big difference. .
Yeah. I prefer , though.
Yeah.
 I guess it's nice place to live when you are like seventy or something.
.
.
O K.
I think so.
. Many people are skiing. And this looks like mountain, and it's winter. And there is a coffee shop or something in the sky is clear. And people wearing like really colorful ski wears. And, I don't know, there is a snowman in a ground. And four kids are playing with the snows. And one guy is like falling down on a ski. . And looks like the ski lesson is taking place, yeah. . This guy is teaching to three people how to ski, yeah.
.
 I don't know. It's one of those trend stuff. And, I guess, like if you wanna playing in the snow, like I think snowboarding, like you can do different stuff from other people. So, that's why I think the young Japanese people think it's cool.
. You know, different from majority of people skiing.
So, you know, young people likes to do different stuff like majorities. So I think that that's the reason.
No.
 O K.
. I bought, like a product from your place, like yesterday. And I took it to my place, but I found out that I didn't like it. And I'm just wondering if I can exchange it.
. I bought a clothes. But it didn't fit me.
It was too small.
Yes. But . Like .
 I mean, I couldn't do anything because I didn't fit me. And like I couldn't like give it to like family or anything. Beause I live by myself. So I really want you to exchange it.
Because I was in a hurry. And I check the size tag, and it says like medium. So I fit me, but it didn't. So I don't think fault.
Yeah. But the size tag said it's medium. .
 I mean, I'm small. So like I normally buy like one or two, size. So I thought the medium would be a little bigger or something. But it didn't fit me. .
. Then, where is your manager now?
O K. Is he coming back?
. Can I talk to him, ?
. I'll come back
in a hour or something.
O K.
No.
 . I normally like check the size like in a fitting room or so. And I'm really careful about buying stuff. So I don't really like buy stuff like I . So I haven't been in this situation before.

O K.
.
.
 I'm sorry. . . . Can I say "I"?
 driving a car. And we kinda each other slightly. And his cell phone was broke by the shock of the bumping. And we called the police, and I told the policeman that he was actually talking on a cell phone riding a bike at the same time. And the was so the policeman took his bike, and this guy like riding a bike didn't do anything about it.
. it's really annoying. And like driving a car talking on a cell phone at the same time is really dangerous. And harm people walking stuff. And talking on the cell phone in the train is, I mean, you can answer the phone and like say something like "I will call you back.". .
Briefly. But that's fine. But like people who, you know, talks and talks and talks for like twenty minutes or something in a train, that's really like trouble for other passengers, I think.
. . . 
I am excited.
