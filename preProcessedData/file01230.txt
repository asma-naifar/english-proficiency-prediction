Actually <R>o</R> only one person listening to the teacher but others are just playing around,<OL>reading</OL>, E-mailing, wondering around, and talking to each other. <..></..> <??></??> sunny day. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah. <F>Hm</F>.It's really <F>hm</F> diverse. American, Asian, I don't know,so many races.More?<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Here?The class was so much smaller<OL>so that</OL> teacher could teach individually,ask questions.Yeah.

We would just <laughter>ignore it</laughter>.We just leave them alone.Some teachers say just "Wake up," but others, no, they don't really care, I think. I don't know, they just <??></??> go on or they just don't notice that because <SC>they're</SC> <SC>like they're re</SC> they're busy like teaching or, I don't know.Teachers. <F>Hm</F>. In <F>er</F> here, I think, <SC>teacher</SC> <SC>all the</SC> almost all the teachers <SC>sa</SC> teach the same way, kind of. They just read the textbook and follow the textbook.<OL>In the</OL> U S, <SC>they just</SC> like all the teacher teach like differently.Or different stuff even though there're like class names, <OL>like</OL>"History" or like "American History" likethere are like five teachers working.But like all the teachers saying like differently, like, I don't know, all the tests are different.But here, like everyone take the like exactly the same test, soit's really different.O K.Sure. <nvs>sigh</nvs><F>Er</F> I made a reservation for the train <OL>ticket</OL>.But I was too late to <SC>t</SC> catch the train so <OL><R>can I</R></OL>can I change the ticket? <OL><??></??></OL>.Sure.Yes. <CO><?>It's</?></CO>.<CO><F>Oh</F> what about</CO>. <F>Er</F> <F>oh</F> or can I have my money back?<.></.> <F>Mhmm</F>.<OL>Can I</OL> make a new one? <F>Ohh</F> <laughter><F>er</F> never mind</laughter>.<..></..> It's hard. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F> all right.

Didn't it? <R>Didn't</R> didn't the train come earlier <OL>than it was supposed to</OL>?<nvs>sigh</nvs> <..></..>Yeah, <F>well</F> <SC?>my</SC?> <.></.> but my grandmother <laughter>died</laughter> and <SC>she</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>her</SC> what, my brother called me.So I had to talk to him about some stuff about my grandmother. So I couldn't leave my house early.So can I please <OL>exchange <?>tickets</?></OL>?<nvs>sigh</nvs><CO><F>Oh</F> may I talk to the <?>man</?> <F>er</F> who has the responsibility <OL>for</OL></CO>?Can I wait?Or can I <OL><??></??></OL>?<nvs>laughter</nvs> No, it's <laughter>O K</laughter>.Yes.O K.

I've never taken the train in the U S.<OL>because</OL> we didn't need it <OL>or</OL>yeah, I don't see it. So when I came here and when I realized that I had to take a train to go to <R>sc</R> school, <SC>I was</SC> <F>er</F> it took me like an hour to go to school.And I couldn't believe how long it <laughter>takes</laughter> to go to like some place to the other.<SC>Because</SC> yeah, because when I was in the U S, it only took me like fifteen minutes <SC>by a car</SC> with a car, so that was really surprising.<OL>And</OL> the Japanese trains are like <?>like</?> it's too crowded in the morning <OL>especially</OL>.<CO>I think <SC>it's sma</SC> it's too small or something or</CO>.It's <laughter>really</laughter> crowded.<SC>Like</SC> but <SC>they don't</SC> I think Japanese people, they don't really care <SC>how</SC> about like touching other people's body, because in the U S, like people really care. Like, you know,<OL>when they</OL> have like contact with others,<OL>they just say</OL> "Excuse me.".<OL>But <R>i</R></OL> in Japan, like nobody say like "Excuse me" or <OL>anything</OL>.They just <?>stay</?> <OL><??></??></OL>.<?>place</?>.<OL>I think <R>it's</R></OL> it's really interestinghow people don't care about touching <?>themselves</?>.So <R>one</R> <F>oh</F> one day last week, <F>um</F> two girls planned to go to camping together with a car. <F>Oh</F> it was great weather until they started cooking their meals for their lunch. And it started raining and <.></.> really windy. So everything they had blew away. <R>So <SC>they decided to</SC> <.></.> they</R> so they decided to leave that place and stay at hotel called "Hotel Cosmos".<SC>So</SC> and they stayed in the hotel until the rain stopped.But <F>er</F> not including sport, right? <OL><F>Um</F></OL>.<F>Mm</F> camping. I haven't gone to camping since I was like fifth grade.I was in this <SC>campings</SC> Y M C A campingprogram.And I went camping like every weekwith like so many kids.So last time I went, I think it was mountain that I went.You know, <R>we s</R> we slept over outside near the river.<SC>We</SC> <SC>was</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> the most exciting part was camp fire.Like we make the fire by <OL>ourselves with woods and all the stuff</OL>although we haven't a lighter. Yeah. And I think <.></.> <SC>we ate</SC> we cooked with like real fireof the stove in the evening.We cooked <F>oh</F> fish, rice, you know, some kind of soup.And ate. Like hundred people eating together.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I think it started raining that day, too.<SC>So</SC> but <R>we</R> we didn't have any place to <F>um</F> sleep overinside.So we just had to close our sleeping bags and sleep.<OL>Yeah</OL>. <OL>Yeah</OL>. And I got sick <?>the next day</?>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>But it was fun after <OL><laughter>all</laughter></OL>.<OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.<CO>Actually there's</CO>. <F>Hm</F>.Going homeon the train. I think I'm gonna go back to my dance club,<OL>because</OL> I left there because I have this test.<SC>And</SC>so I'm gonna go back there and have some meeting,and ask some questions that I had it today.And then go home with my friends with the train.<nvs>laughter</nvs> You too. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Nice talking to you. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Thank you.
