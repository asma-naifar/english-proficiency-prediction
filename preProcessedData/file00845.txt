About myself?
 I work in a legal division for the trading company. so I check a draft, many kind of contracts. And I sometimes deal with some claim on other companies and sometimes consumers. Mainly, that .
And I like gamble, horse racing and mah-jongg, you know?
?
 I like sports, too. I belong to tennis club of our company, and I will go skiing next weekend.

.
 when I was in a dormitory for students in my university days, I learned mah-jongg. some of the senior students in the dormitory taught me.
 and also, the horse racing, I learned from them.
.
 . Good friends.
 from university? most of them are in Tokyo
 I graduated university and graduate school in Tokyo. So, in Osaka, I don't have so much friends from university, just a few of them. So I miss them .
Yeah. last April, I came to Osaka to work Osaka legal department. It was my first time to come .
How do you like? I like. I think there is not so big difference from Osaka and Tokyo.
 is a little bit smaller than Tokyo, 
it also big city
and convenient.
.
 to tell the truth, Tokyo.

 . . Many people are enjoying skiing. some children are playing with snowballs, maybe, this is Nagano prefecture because there're a lot of snow. I think this ski is on a high mountain. and I have never been to the ski around the, how can I say, Kansai district. I always ski around Kanto prefecture like Nagano prefecture. . Yes. Yeah. ski board is crashing. I think this is not so popular because although on the , there are many people, but on the lift there is no one. So I think it's not so popular . on the , how can I say, cottage, I can see couple drinking some hot drinks, coffee or coco .
.
.
.
Salt Lake City? actually, I haven't watched Olympic game on .
 Olympic game,
not so much
because I don't watch T V so much in ordinary days.
.
. Yes.
 I imagine
Salt Lake's is bigger than Nagano. I just imagine
Salt Lake City is colder than Nagano
.
I think so.
Best? I've been to some in Tohoku prefecture to Hokuriku district. I forgot some of the name, but I remember that the 
 Zao was broad.
And the snow was powder snow.
And there was many interesting course. So I think Zao is one of the best . .
