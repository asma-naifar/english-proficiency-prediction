My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Me, too.<F>Oh</F>. <OL>Thank you</OL>.<F>Oh</F> I had a seminar today <F>erm</F> at <H pn="company name1">XXX03</H> <??></??>. <R>Do you</R> do you know <H pn="company name1">XXX03</H>?Yes, and I'll be recruiting starting next year, so I just want to hear some people make sure about the company.<F>Erm</F>. The place was held at <R>To</R> Tokyo <F>erm</F> International Forum in <F>erm</F> Yurakucho. <F>Erm</F>. It was a nice place <laughter>to sit down</laughter> and hear the lecture, but it wasn't too interesting.<nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Erm</F>. It was a rough description about the company, and also there were many <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> information that I already knew and also can easily find on the Internet. <.></.> So it was maybe interesting for people who are not <F>erm</F> <SC>interesting or</SC> interested or don't have any idea of what <H pn="company name1">XXX03</H> is doing, but not for us.<OL>Here in <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H></OL>?<F>Oh</F> Yes. <laughter><F>Erm</F> thank you for <F>er</F> asking a question</laughter>.Compare to other universities, <F>erm</F> I study economics <.></.> <F>erm</F> but <.></.> hardly we don't have to go to school <F>erm</F> <laughter>we don't have to hear</laughter> <F>er</F> professors lecturing about their <F>erm</F> very unique <laughter><F>erm</F></laughter> curriculum. And instead, we just have to collect <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> friend's papers <laughter>and <F>er</F></laughter> to memorize before the terms.<laughter>Yes</laughter>.<F>Oh</F>. In one way, yes. Because I can use <R>my free time</R> <laughter>my free time</laughter> <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> to do my part time job or <F>erm</F> for instance, today go to seminars. So very useful if you have knowledge to use time enough <??></??>.<F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>I</SC> have you heard from my teacher? She is <OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Oh</F> I deliver pizza at <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H>. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. Sorry, it's not <H pn="company name3">XXX06</H> <OL><laughter>because</laughter></OL>if you like <H pn="company name3">XXX06</H>, but and right now it's Christmas time, so I wear Santa costume and deliver to <F>erm</F> houses.Yes.<F>Erm</F>. It's probably the climate. Climate, yes.For example, in the wintertime it's very cold so you have to wear <F>erm</F> additional clothes in order to keep warm. And <F>well</F> in the rainy season, <laughter>you have to</laughter> wear your raincoats because <SC>you'll get wet</SC> you will get soaked. And also in the summer time, you'll get suntan since the sunshine is very strong.Yes.You're welcome.O K. <F>Erm</F>. Do I have to think or <??></??>?O K. <F>Um</F> I think it's held during the summer time or <F>erm</F> maybe <F>erm</F> in a <SC>hot climate</SC> hot place. And it should be arithmetic, and <.></.> <F>well</F> not too many people are studying very well. It's sort of like <H pn="school name1">XXX04</H>. <laughter>And</laughter> <SC>people are</SC> <F>erm</F> some people are talking with each other. Some people are gazing outside the window. <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F>. They're making their e-mail. And also they're not <F>erm</F> interested at all. But the teacher is trying to teach. I think she, <F>erm</F> a young lady, very beautiful, is trying to teach, but I don't think she is into teaching because she is just looking at the blackboard. Also the window is open, so some people could <F>er</F> look outside. Maybe it could be hot, and there is no air conditioning. But the doors are closed, so it should be the air conditioning problem. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>It's fairly small</SC> the class is fairly small. Maybe twelve to sixteen, fifteen. <F>Erm</F>. Since there is only three rows <.></.> <F>er</F> inside on the side end. <F>Er</F> <F>erm</F>. They are dressed very well.<F>Well</F> actually I went to all boys' school. We didn't have <F>er</F> girls there, and <.></.> also we didn't have women teachers. <laughter><R>That</R> that many women teachers</laughter>.<F>Oh</F>. This is very sort of like junior high and elementary school because <F>erm</F> you know, the students they are doing whatever they want. Also they're not listening to the teacher, but that's similar to high school in my class because we didn't listen to teacher.<laughter>We didn't</laughter> but we didn't, you know, listen to music and use our mails and <SC>look</SC> watch outside and talk to our friends because you know the teacher was very strict. He'll get very angry.<F>Mmm</F> <F>well</F> it depends on the situation, the teacher. Because <R>if he or</R> if he or she is just <F>erm</F> hired to talk or just to teach, I don't care. But <SC>if he's hired or</SC> if he or she is hired <F>erm</F> to improve the class, you know, maybe I'll get <SC>more</SC> maybe <F>erm</F> more aggressive. <CO><OL>Or get</OL></CO>.Aggressive. <F>Erm</F>. First, see she's looking at the blackboard, not the students, so that's not communicating to students. And also <F>erm</F> this is probably saying that she isn't aware of the class what the class is doing. So I think I would, you know, walk around the class and talk to the students more. To get more communication, and, you know, <F>erm</F> try to get the students to study.O K.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. <F>Oh</F> I actually teach I don't teach, but I coach kids swimming and basketball in my elementary school.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>.<OL><laughter>I hope so</laughter></OL>.O K.Hello, <F>erm</F> <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<F>Erm</F> I really really wanted to go to your party, but, you know, <SC>some</SC> in some circumstances <R>I</R> I'm not able to go. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. You know, <F>erm</F> <.></.> <R>I've</R> I've told you before that I was <SC>recruiting</SC> job recruiting, right? And <F>erm</F> fortunately, I had a chance to talk to <F>er</F> superior at <H pn="company name4">XXX07</H>, which I really really wanted to go. Yes. And so <R>if</R> if I miss that appointment, you know, it will be a big disadvantage for me to <F>erm</F> start recruiting. So you know <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I'm very sorry, but I probably can't go to your party.<F>Oh</F> Today?Today?<..></..> Today?O K?<.></.> <F>Oh</F>. Then, it's a whole different story. <OL><??></??></OL>.<OL><R>I'm</R></OL> I'm probably calling in advance.<OL>I'll probably give you</OL> a couple days.Hey, you know, <F>erm</F> <SC>all</SC> I was trying to call you earlier, but my superior whom I got a chance to call was so busy, and I couldn't catch him. So, you know, <R>I</R> I just got a phone from right now. And I was very pleased to talk to him. And I really really wanted to get this job, so maybe <F>erm</F> if there is another party you have, <F>erm</F> I'll surely like you invite me again.<F>Oh</F> Sorry about that. Maybe <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> <.></.> yeah <R>I was</R> I was very pleased and honored to have this party, but, you know, <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> because <H pn="company name4">XXX07</H>, you know, <R>it's</R> it's really the company I really wanted to go. So, you know, <R>you</R> you have to please sorry about that.<F>Oh</F>. Yes. Sorry about that. Bye-bye.<OL>O K</OL>.<OL><laughter>No, no</laughter></OL>.In America, yes.Yes.<F>Well</F> I was going to meet my friend. We're going to the movies, but, you know, <R>I</R> <.></.> I thought I had my job off that day. But actually I didn't. <F>Well</F> I had a job off, but <SC>my friend</SC> my colleague <F>well</F> <F>erm</F> <SC><R>he</R> he got sick</SC> he got ill, so he couldn't make his job. But he was on, and so I had to <F>erm</F> go <??></??>. I had to substitute him. And you know <R>I</R> I <??></??>. He replace me sometimes, so I couldn't <.></.> try to get another person. <SC>I couldn't</SC> <R>I</R> I had to substitute so I had to lie to my friend. <CO>And</CO>.<F>Oh</F>. You know, <R>I</R> I thought I had a day open today, <R>I</R> I had free, but <.></.> <R>my</R> <R>my store</R> my store manager called me today, and he is like saying, "When are you coming?". <.></.> So I couldn't make it today. Sorry about that.<F>Well</F> I treated him <OL><laughter>lunch day after</laughter></OL>.<F>Uum</F>. O K. <.></.> <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> One day last week, as I was riding my <SC>bicycle</SC> <F>erm</F> motorbike, <F>erm</F> <R>I</R> I had a call from my girlfriend, and we were talking about <SC>our plans</SC> our schedules <SC>next week</SC> <.></.> <F>erm</F> this week. <F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> I was talking <SC>this car</SC> this orange car ran into me. He tried to turn left, and he sort of overturned his car and bumped into <SC>my rear</SC> <R>my</R> my right rear of the <SC>car</SC> bike. When we had crashed, we had a collision and my phone and my motorcycle got ripped. And we almost had a fight, but <R>in</R> in these kind of collisions we were supposed to call police and show them the traffic accident. So we had to call <.></.> the police, but <.></.> as you already know, my phone was <F>erm</F> crashed so he had to call. <nvs>cough</nvs> And after the policeman came to the place, <F>erm</F> we had to tell <SC>the</SC> how we crashed and he was saying that I was on the phone. And he didn't say it was his fault because <F>erm</F> after we go to talk to the insurance company, you know, <SC><R>which</R> which fault</SC> <SC>how</SC> what the ratio the fault is he was trying to make me as the person who made the accident. But <SC>I was riding straight</SC> I was going straight, and the car was turning left so I think the car was wrong. And <SC>my car</SC> my bike got ripped so I couldn't go to school so I had JAF. <R>Do you</R> do you know JAF? <SC>I had JAF</SC> I had to call JAF and they took my bike to my nearby store, and that is why I was late to <R>scho</R> school.<R>I</R> I ride my bike to school.Yes, yes.<F>Well</F> it's sort of like this, but <SC>I wasn't driving</SC> I wasn't using my phone. <R>It's</R> it's just the same situation excluding the phone.<F>Oh</F> I knew that I wasn't <R>the</R> you know, the victim. <F>Oh</F> I was actually <F>erm</F> the person who got injured <.></.> so <.></.> all I had to do was ask <F>erm</F> <SC>how</SC> I had to wait for <SC>the <F>erm</F> upon the car</SC> the driver's insurance company to call myself and to go under how much he'll pay for my repair fee.<F>Erm</F>. No, the insurance got very nice. Keep <R>ap</R> apologize for <??></??>.Yes.So that was O K.I think <F>well</F> you have to move if you are <R>caught a car</R> caught a car accident, you move your car to the safe place so that the traffic won't get disturbed. And after that, you call the police, <.></.> <R>and</R> <laughter><F>erm</F></laughter> and <F>er</F> tell whatever you are. <R>We</R> we got <SC>insu</SC> <F>er</F> a collision and the police will call you. He'll investigate. <F>Well</F> he won't investigate, but <SC>this special person</SC> specialist of traffic accident will call him, and he'll <R>draw</R> draw this map and stuff that you just have to report it. And that's the police and then <SC>you have to</SC> <R>if you are</R> if you are on, you have to call your insurance company. And hopefully he'll call the insurance company. Also and then they'll decide about <F>er</F> how to pay or. <SC>If I'm wrong</SC> if I am the victim, how I am going to pay, I'm going to use my money <R>or</R> or I'm going to use the insurance.After this I have school. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>The class that I must take.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mmm</F>. <.></.>I think I had a nice time, time-wise,<OL>but</OL> not academic-wise.Thank you.
