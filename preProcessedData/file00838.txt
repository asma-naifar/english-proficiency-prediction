One day last week, <F>erm</F> <F>well</F> Mister Smith <F>err</F> drove <F>er</F> his car <F>erm</F> <R>to</R> to go to his office in the morning. And then, <F>er</F> <SC>he was</SC> <F>well</F> although it was <SC>a la</SC> <F>err</F> weekends, <F>erm</F> he need to work. So he was, I think, <?>little bit</?> rushed at that moment. And, <F>er</F> at that time, <F>erm</F> one young boy is come across with his bike talking on his mobile phones <R>with</R> <F>err</F> with his girlfriends. And, <SC>su</SC> because he was so <F>er</F> enjoyed <nvs>laughter</nvs> the conversation with <F>err</F> his girlfriend, <F>erm</F> <R>he</R> he happen to <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> crash a little bit <SC>but</SC> with Mister Smith's car. <F>Uh</F> and, <F>erm</F> although, <SC>he was</SC> I mean, Mister Smith was rushed, but he <R>go</R> got out from <F>er</F> his car, and <F>err</F> listened to, <SC>his</SC> I don't know, his name <SC>but his <F>er</F> story</SC> <SC>because <F>err</F> he was so angry and</SC> because he was so angry <F>erm</F> that his bike was broken, when crashed to Mister Smith's car.And also mobile phone was crashed. <F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> a police <F>erm</F> arrived to the crashed <F>er</F> situation for support, but Mister Smith <F>er</F> claimed that maybe he was <SC>so</SC> <F>er</F> involved in <F>er</F> talking to <F>err</F> somebody on mobile phone, that's why <F>err</F> he was a little bit careless <F>err</F> to drove the bike.And the policeman <F>er</F> took his point, and, you know, <F>er</F> although <R>the</R> the guy on a bike <F>er</F> insist that <F>er</F> he wasn't wrong, <F>er</F> the policeman <?>ask</?>, <SC>that</SC> who was that, <F>erm</F> maybe the agency <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> who <F>er</F> collect those <F>er</F> crashed bike or cars, <F>erm</F> just <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> collect the bike.
