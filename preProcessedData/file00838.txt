O K. a young female teacher is trying to most boring mathematics, , to the high school guys, no, maybe Junior high? I think they're high school guys because some girls make up themselves with eye shadows, eyelashes. yeah, and they show, you know, nails, color of nails each other. So they're enjoying fashion rather than mathematics. And most of them doesn't hear anything about mathematics. I don't know if it is typical for .
 I think it is, you know one of the girls involving handling her mobile phone. I think she is doing a mobile mail, you know. and also, yeah, other girls are talking on nail colors and cosmetics.
And no, just one boy, actually, listen to the lectures. And the rest two are looking outside of the window. And also, rest of are drinking and hearing the music. Yeah.
Yes.
.
.
O K. I'm actually this one, I mean, 
yeah, other things, not always the cosmetics or appearing or the boys matters. I like to think or imagine anything, you know. Nothing related to the mathematics because I didn't like the mathematics.
Yeah, so, actually, I, maybe, look outside as this guy 
and, maybe, reading other books. .
.
.
.
.
.
O K.
Yeah.

Hello. . I bought this today at your shop, maybe two hours ago. I was very rush, and I , I mean, overlook the sign board.
I actually need to buy a different sizes of the .
 I certainly mistook, you know, and
 change my products to the size which I want to buy.
.
 really?
 but I was so rushed, you know. but, if the sign boards looks, you know, outstanding and flashy, I don't know, then I didn't mistake, you know, but I couldn't just catch, .
And I didn't use it. I walk around in this shopping mall, and I happened to know, you know, this is the wrong size.
.
.
.
 is it possible to talk to your managers?
Yeah, because I bought a different size, you know, which I don't necessary.
So, if your manager have a time to see me, I need to explain
 situation.
Yes. .
Yes. . open the bag?
.
?
No, no, no, no.
 the outside wrap, 
I opened it. 
why I realized the size, but, you know, the inner wrap,
yeah, I didn't open it.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes. .
 thank you.

O K. so, maybe he'll come back here. .
Yeah. O K. So, shall I wait here
 a moment? .
Yeah.
? O K. Then, I will go out from this shop for a moment.
 one hour. 
that O K with you?
.
Thank you very much.
.
O K.
 yes. .
Yes. that was twenty-sixth or twenty-third, maybe, yeah, year-end season of last year.
And I suddenly need to go to India for the training course in January. 
I need to apply a visa at that moment. And then, since the Indian Embassy is just open on twenty-sixth, and I have just one day to took a picture.
 I was so rushed. And, you know, I thought that the camera man would take picture for me at that time, so I just need to, you know, sit down and relax.
But the photo shop nearby my company is just introduced a new store there, you know, big automatic 
camera booth, I should say. , you know, you can walk in the booth and insert the coins, and follow the instructions. you know, just push button
 follow instructions to take a picture. But, since I was so rushed, you know, I insert the coins, maybe, that was seven hundred yen, not cheap, .
 I thought it was expensive. And, since I was rushed, I pushed the buttons too fast. And I mistake the size.
. It was two kinds of sizes for visas and maybe, I don't know, for passport. I don't know. There was two .
And, I suddenly realized that I took different size pictures.
And then, , , you know, I was so rushed, so I insisted 
I was wrong. And, maybe, ,
the instruction was too fast or too slow,
so I got a different sizes. 
"Can I try again?". That's what I asked to the .
.
 actually, I.
.
 . I wouldn't say 
.
.
O K. Right.
.
Yeah. Mister Smith drove his car to go to his office in the morning. And then, although it was weekends, he need to work. So he was, I think, rushed at that moment. And, at that time, one young boy is come across with his bike talking on his mobile phones with his girlfriends. And, because he was so enjoyed the conversation with his girlfriend, he happen to crash a little bit with Mister Smith's car. and, although, I mean, Mister Smith was rushed, but he got out from his car, and listened to, I don't know, his name story he was so angry and that his bike was broken, when crashed to Mister Smith's car.
And also mobile phone was crashed. a police arrived to the crashed situation for support, but Mister Smith claimed that maybe he was involved in talking to somebody on mobile phone, that's why he was a little bit careless to drove the bike.
And the policeman took his point, and, you know, although the guy on a bike insist that he wasn't wrong, the policeman , who was that, maybe the agency who collect those crashed bike or cars, just collect the bike. And, maybe, I guess that the policeman judged, I mean, the young guy has a fault,
, in driving his bike.
 difficult.
Sorry.
.
 it is dangerous, yeah, I think. although he or she is good at driving, either cars or bikes, whatever, mobile phone, you know, makes one very concentrated to, you know, hearing the sounds.
Yeah, so I think it is very dangerous, yeah. And that's why there is a earphones just like this, you know, attached to the mobile phone.
 I think that is much safer
 of the car.
But, not for bike. .
Yeah.
.
.
, thank you very much.
.
I hope so. .
 this coming weekend, on Saturday, I need to work. .
Yes.
.
.
Thank .
.
O K. And sorry about being late.
