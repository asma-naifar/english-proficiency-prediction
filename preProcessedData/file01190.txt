I was on cross-country running in the fall and <.></.> in the track but <nvs>laughter</nvs> actually I was in a musicalfor the winter, but <.></.> <SC>beca</SC> it was because <R>I</R> I couldn't pass the <F>ahm</F> audition for basketball.The coach didn't take me and my sisterjust because we were foreign exchange student.<OL>I didn't</OL> get <OL><laughter>in</laughter></OL>.But he said that.<OL>So</OL> <F>er</F> like, "O K. <F>Well</F> I don't <OL><laughter>care</laughter></OL>".<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.<F>Ahm</F> I was playing the violin.I couldn't take the audition cause I was away for that date.And <F>ahm</F> since I've been playing <SC>for <F>ah</F></SC> the violin for thirteen years,I was the concert mistress.And then <F>ahm</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> the conductor put my <laughter>violin</laughter> <F>ahm</F> an amp.<SC>That</SC> you know what I mean?So that's kind of big <OL><laughter>job, actually</laughter></OL>.<OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.Thank you.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Hum</F>.
