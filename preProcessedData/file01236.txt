 to see many pictures,
 to see photographs.
And I like art. So I'm doing painting by myself, too. .
Yes.
Oil paintings.
.
I like a abstract pictures
but  now I'm doing, you know, just  drawing flowers and so on
just for practice.

 I think.
Yes. And for abstract painting,  you can feel    your own feeling.

Yes.
 I'm   working as a counselor
for the student  who wish study in England and Switzerland,
and Canada.
Yes.

to study   in Europe   some other countries
and they really change  during their study.

 I like  the  performing art
of England
because  it's very popular.    and England has  the  history.
And you can visit many places from U K
to go to France and to Belgium.
Many places, so it's good place for traveling.

    a man is  standing near from the table. And the couple  is just about to  eat dinner.

And  yes, there are only couples in this restaurant.  and  it seems that  they look quite happy. And maybe they are celebrating some  anniversaries
 but I don't know, maybe birthday party. . And  the man, he's tasting  red wine.
.
.
Yeah.
.
 it depends. If   it is a Valentine's Day,
I will prepare dinner by myself.

and have a dinner,

O K. .  one day last week,  I have a promise to meet my friend, so I drove a car to go to that place. And the man was  driving   motor bicycle. And he came just in front of me. At that time he was calling  by mobile phone. And I crashed to him accidentally. And his mobile phone was broken down.  And  he complained about it. So  I must call the policeman to come and explain what happened to him.  And  lastly,  yes,  not only mobile phone but also his  motor bicycle has  broken down, so he couldn't drive any more. . ? His  motor bicycle was also  taken by   some driver. So I must compensate to him later, so I'm very worry about this accident now. 
.
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
 not now.
Yeah.
Yes.
.  if you  train,  you can enjoy scenery but you must bring  your baggage by yourself.
And it's not convenient.
 if you are not driver to drive a car, it's very convenient
 sleep and you can do whatever you want.
You can see magazines and you can enjoy scenery.
 if you are driver, it's too tiring.
. So I prefer to travel by train.
.
And   I don't need to worry about the accident.
Yes.
. .
.
Yes. I will meet my friend
yes,  dinner.
Yes.  it's Ginza.
 restaurant.

No.  it's not convenient from .
But  because today is Friday
 need to worry about tomorrow.
. .
Thank you.
