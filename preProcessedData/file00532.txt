My name is .
. Yes, please.
. Yes. I like summer. But today, it's very hot.
.     I usually  go to the movies or  watching T V.
.
. I like to watch the    non-fiction program. For example,  N H K special or foreign  countries' culture.
Excuse me?
. Because   I like to know about the foreign  cultures. . It's so interesting. .  I can get  more information about this.
.        I like to know new things and       but      I enjoy to learn.
Yes.
.    I like Indian culture and studying now. So  I've been to India three times.
And totally,  I stayed there for about two month.
 . Then,  I have many happy memories, but   when I went the south India,
it's beach resort.
. It's very beautiful  scenery and  very peaceful. 
So  I like the beach resort very much.
 . I think it's    in a restaurant. And there are  nine people in the room. And  they are talking each other   and eating or drinking.  And      the place is so big. And  one woman is  playing piano.  it's seven o'clock now.  .  one waiter is   asking a couple to drink wine.   I can see some trees.
.
.
. In India, the cost is very different from Japan.
It's so low cost. So  I can order  in menu even  the very good restaurant.
.  it's  as same as lunchtime price. And   in India,   a   there are two kinds of restaurants,  vegetarian restaurant and  non-  vegetarian restaurant.
So   we can choose  one type restaurant. And   in Japan, there are many foreign countries' restaurant. But in India, it's not so variety.  the  mostly, in Indian restaurant,     for example, south-Indian style restaurant and east Indian restaurant.
.   but  nowadays,   new  foreign countries' restaurants opened. .   so I went to the Chinese restaurant and     I ate  Italian menu, too.

 movie.

. . O K.  I saw "The Tailor of Panama" recently. . It's  last month,  I've seen the movie.  It's preview of  the cinema.  a friend of mine  got  the pair ticket of preview. So  we went  the  I'm not sure but  Yomiuri  or  maybe the such kind of  theater. And the film is  about the Panama and it's  political.
And   spy movie.
. It's  so interesting movie.
But little difficult because of the political story.

.
   last Saturday, I went to the department store in Shinjuku   to buy something. And I looked for  the  present    for my husband   for his birthday. And   I search the present   for two or three hours. And finally,  I found very good design necktie. And I   decided to buy it.  and I tried to   go back  to home. But    when I decided to go out the department store,     I saw the bargain sale advertisement near the exit. So, I decided to see   some things  for a little time. . But when I walk  around to see the clothes and shoes,   there are many, many items    for big discount. So  I bought          some things  for myself. And   when I went out the store,  I had so many  bags.
. Me?
. Last time.    for my friend.   the end of last month, I bought  some small things  for my friend. Because    the time, he went to India for  working. So,  I gave him   souvenir for  his sister and family.
.  I will go to the university.
Yes.
    I will enter the hospital 
 weekend. So   I can't get the exam    next Monday. ,
