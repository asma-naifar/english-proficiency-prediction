 I have a  class in  university. So   I wake up late. And, yeah, I prepare in  classroom because   I'm taking a  the computer classes. I have a lot of homework.  So I prepare in the  computer's class in the morning. Then    I'm go to school. .
Yes. But it's very difficult for me.
 I'm first time to touch a computer.
And I bought a computer last year. But I just use for the e-mail,
or to see Internet. That's all. So I don't know     how to make     homepages.
  because  my class must  make homepages by  myself.
It's very difficult .
.
. Because everybody  use computer now. Even though the children. And elementary school's  pupils also use computer in the class. But  I didn't have   any chance  before   the university. So  maybe      if I can learn the  computer,  it will be useful ,
  in near future.
