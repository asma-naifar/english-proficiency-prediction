 for the general Japanese, it's a very difficult to fix for the high priority for the personal setting. So is a normal case to cancel the personal party instead of the business affairs.

 situation is completely different.
Yeah. When I visited the Germany, at that time, my boss said, " many German people care you because this is your first time for me to go Germany. So the end of your business trip, you should invite all of the partners. And maybe German people like to enjoy Japanese food.". So my boss recommended good Japanese restaurant. But one of my count partner, he couldn't attend. And his friend explained about the situation. He spend two weekends for abroad by business trip. His wife became very angry because the every weekend, this couple, how can I say, used to go to the dance school. So my count partner canceled twice dancing. So
 he couldn't attend.

O K.

. One day last week, the young guys met to his uncle by chance. So the uncle is kindly recommended to go to the restaurant. And they selected the western style restaurant. so the young guys selecting some dishes, and enjoyed beers and dishes. And of course, in this case, uncle paid all of these bills. So this young guys very satisfied for the economically and physically. and finally, they says goodbye, and that's all. 
Yeah. this is also Japanese customs. So the elder person, especially, I explain between these men's some relations. . So generation gap seems to be more than twenty years or something. So young guys looks like a student or not gain the money for the working. So these situation, the Japanese custom is elder person pay all bills including young guys' or something.
.
Yeah. So I and my young colleagues spend work late at night, and with finished work, and I went to the, for example, restaurants or something with my colleagues. so at that time, I said, "I want to go to drink with you.". sometimes I want, how can I say, ask some business matter or something. .
Yeah.
