O K. . recommended one restaurant, so he his professor. And then, has favorite seat, so he said " I wanted to sit that table.". And after sitting, one waitress asked them the menu, university student felt very hungry. So, he asked her big dishes, and his professor said, " that was O K. you were young so you had 
to eat a lot.".
 and very happy
 they enjoyed very much.
So the university student ordered some beer.
 after eating, his professor said, " that was my treat," so his professor paid all money.
And university student
 felt very happy. After that, they said, "Good-bye.".
 maybe once a week. No, no, no. Week, no, no, no, .
Once a year.
