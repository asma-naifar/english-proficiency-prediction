So I usually watch <F>ee</F> video tape or <F>er</F> D V D.<F>Er</F>. <CO>Recently, <F>ee</F> I saw the</CO>. <F>er</F> <F>errr</F> <F>er</F> <laughter>I forgot the name</laughter> of the <F>err</F> movie. <F>Er</F>. <R>I s</R> I saw the "Autumn in New York".<F>Er</F>. It's a featuring <F>err</F> <SC?>it's</SC?> <F>err</F> Richard Gear.<R>It's a s</R> it's a story of the young <F>er</F> woman and a middle-age <SC>men</SC> <F>er</F> man.It's a kind of love story.<F>Hum-huh</F>.Yeah. <F>Er</F>. That <F>ur</F> picture seems to <F>ur</F> be <F>eh</F> a <F>err</F> residential area. <F>Err</F>. There is a house, <F>uu</F> and there is <F>er</F> some <F>eh</F> women and <R>s</R> some children. And <F>er</F> a man is running <R>alo</R> <F>er</F> along the road. And also, <F>er</F> <F>err</F> there are <F>eh</F> several animals, <F>uu</F> <F>er</F> and also, <F>er</F> a man <F>er</F> sitting in the bench <F>ee</F> is reading the newspaper. And it's a very <F>ee</F> <F>er</F> calm and a very comfortable residential area. <F>Er</F>. There is no <F>er</F> traffic. <F>Ur</F>. Only one car is parked <F>eh</F> along the road. And <F>ee</F> the weather is <F>uu</F> fine, and <SC>the sunshine</SC> the sun is shining. And <SC>the</SC> it's <F>uu</F> <SC>seems <F>er</F> smiling</SC> seems <F>uu</F> making smile. And also, <F>er</F> the boys are <F>er</F> playing with the ball, and there are several trees. And the <F>er</F> lawn is green.<F>Ah-huh</F>.<F>Er</F>. <OL>Recently, <F>er</F> yes</OL>.<R>In</R> in my case, I'm now interested in Japanese politics, especially in the <F>er</F> movement of the Prime <SC>Mis</SC> Minister Mori. <F>Er</F>. He said <F>uu</F> <F>uu</F> he <R>di</R> didn't say <F>ee</F> <SC>he <SC>wou</SC> will</SC> he would resign. But <F>er</F> <SC>around the <F>er</F> Mori's</SC> <F>ee</F> the man <F>eh</F> around the Mori said he said <R>he</R> he would resign. So it's a very <F>eh</F> complicated and a little bit <F>er</F> kind of <F>er</F> very funny situation.<F>Oh</F>. <R>I</R> <.></.> I don't complain about Mister Mori. But <R>I</R> I complain about the system of Japanese politics. And, especially, <F>er</F> the system of the <F>er</F> L D P, Japanese Liberal Democratic Party.I think <SC>it</SC> there is a very strict seniority system. So the number of the <F>er</F> winning of the election is <F>er</F> very important in the L D P system. <R>So</R> so young politician <F>er</F> <F>er</F> can't get a high position.<F>Hum-huh</F>.Yeah.<F>Hum-huh</F>. I just read this?O K.O K.Yeah.Hello? <F>Er</F>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. Are you <F>errr</F> <R>Mi</R> Miss Suzuki?<F>Oh</F>. Really? <F>Oh</F>. <R>S</R> <F>oh</F> sorry, <R>I</R> I couldn't <F>uu</F> go to your party last night. <F>Ur</F>. So <F>er</F> it's a very <F>ee</F> good dinner party, but <F>er</F> I couldn't <F>ee</F> go <.></.> there. <F>Ur</F>. Because my wife <F>uu</F> <F>ur</F> got sick, and she <F>ee</F> got a high temperature. So <F>er</F> I have to <F>uu</F> stay in <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>mm</F> my house, and <SC>I have to take care of her</SC> <F>er</F> I had to take care of her. So <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> I didn't go to your party.<F>Oh</F>. Sorry. <F>Err</F> <F>er</F>. I'd like to <R>g</R> <F>ee</F> go to your party, but <F>er</F> it's a very <F>ee</F> <F>err</F> urgent situation. And <F>uu</F> <F>er</F> she <F>er</F> <F>ee</F> suddenly <F>ee</F> <F>ee</F> got high temperature, and she <F>ee</F> was fainted. So, <F>er</F> first, I had to take her to the hospital. So <F>er</F> I didn't have time to call you.Yeah. <F>Er</F>. <R>She is</R> <F>er</F> she is getting better and better. So <F>ur</F> I'd like to go to your party. So, <SC>if you have</SC> <F>er</F> if you organize the party, so <F>er</F> I'd like to <F>eh</F> go to your party next time.Yeah.<F>Oh</F>. Thank you.<F>Ah-huh</F>.O K.O K. See you.Yeah.<OL>Yeah, yeah</OL>. I had a <SC>s</SC> <F>eh</F> experience. Yeah. <F>Er</F>. <R>I</R> <F>ee</F> I have a reservation, or I have <F>er</F> an appointment. <F>Mm</F>. But I couldn't go <.></.> there suddenly. <CO>Or</CO>. Yeah.Yeah. Usually, <R>I</R> I'd like to <F>uu</F> <R>get</R> <F>ee</F> get in touch with someone in <R>the</R> the appointment. <F>Ur</F>. But, <F>uu</F> if I had the time to call or so, <R>I</R> <F>ee</F> <SC>I usually</SC> <F>ee</F> <SC>I have to <F>uu</F> <SC>apo</SC> <SC>make apologize</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> make</SC> <R>I</R> I have to apologize.Yeah.<F>Hum-huh</F>.Yeah.<F>Hum-huh</F>.O K. Shall I start?One day last week, <F>erm</F> <.></.> <R>I was</R> <F>er</F> I was driving my car <F>er</F> in a high speed. <F>Ur</F>. <R>And</R> <F>ee</F> and also, there is a <F>er</F> bike. <F>Uu</F> <F>er</F>. A man who is driving the bike <F>uu</F> making a <R>ph</R> <F>er</F> phone call by his mobile phone. And, <SC>maybe, she</SC> <F>er</F> maybe, he is calling to <F>uu</F> his girlfriend. And, after that, <F>erm</F> <R>su</R> suddenly, <F>er</F> <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he dropped his mobile phone, and <F>er</F> the phone hitted my car. And <F>eh</F> the phone <.></.> was broken by hitting. So, after that, <F>uu</F> I <F>ee</F> and he <F>eh</F> talk about it, and he <F>eh</F> got angry with <F>ur</F> breaking a mobile phone. <CO>And also <F>er</F> <R>bre</R> <F>er</F> breaking</CO>. <F>Er</F> <F>oh</F>. So, <SC>about</SC> he was angry at the <F>er</F> breaking his <F>eh</F> bike. Yes. But I think that <F>ur</F> the reason <SC>for</SC> <F>er</F> why <F>er</F> that accident was happened <F>ur</F> is <F>uu</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>he</SC> that <SC>he is</SC> <F>ur</F> he was <F>uu</F> making a phone call with driving. So <F>er</F> <.></.> I just <F>uu</F> listened <F>uu</F> what he was saying. And, after that, the policeman came to the place, and <F>er</F> he listened <F>ur</F> what <R>w</R> was happening. And I explained that <F>uu</F> <R>the m</R> <F>uu</F> the man <F>uu</F> driving <F>er</F> a bike <F>ee</F> <R>made</R> made a phone call, <F>ur</F> so <SC>that accident was</SC> <F>uh</F> that accident happened. <R>S</R> <SC>so</SC> <F>er</F> and <F>ee</F> the policeman <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> understand what I said. <F>Uu</F>. So, <F>ur</F> after that, <F>er</F> <F>err</F> <R>the bro</R> the broken bike was carried by the truck and <F>uu</F> the man who <F>uu</F> drove the bike <F>uu</F> <SC>watch</SC> <F>uu</F> watched <F>uu</F> the bike was carried by truck. <F>Hm</F>. That is my story.<.></.> Yeah. I think there are several reasons. Yeah. One reason is that <F>er</F> like <?>a</?> story, <F>ee</F> so many drivers <F>eh</F> <R>u</R> use a mobile phone with driving. And also, <F>er</F> I think <F>uu</F> there are some <F>ee</F> people who <F>uu</F> drink and drive. That is a very big <F>eh</F> problem, I think. Yeah.<F>Well</F>. I think it's very difficult <laughter>to</laughter> <F>ur</F> deal with the problem. <F>Er</F>. Someone said that <F>er</F> <F>er</F> we had <F>er</F> impose <F>er</F> strict rule on <R>traffic acci</R> traffic accident. <CO><?>Or</?></CO>. <SC>So</SC> and also, I think <F>uu</F> the education of the <F>er</F> driving is very important. So <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>ur</F> I think <F>uu</F> we <F>ee</F> needs a kind of <F>er</F> education system for <F>er</F> people who have a driving license.Yeah.<F>Ah-huh</F>.<F>Er</F>. Yeah. I'll go back to my house. Yeah. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I haven't <R>eaten</R> <F>uh</F> eaten dinner yet, so I'd like to eat <OL><??></??></OL>.No. I think <F>er</F> I'll buy something <SC>in a</SC> at a convenience store. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F>. Yeah.I'll buy some healthy food.Thank you.
