     a woman  last week   went to department    near  her house.   because  he wanted to buy  the birthday present for his husband.  and  he went to the  floor   of the  necktie.  so,            she said    to the man of the shop,   "I want to buy necktie for my husband,  birthday present.". So    she bought a necktie     with      very nice  decoration. . And     go  phoned she phoned the bargain sale  again.    that times, bargain sale  was  clothes,  and the price was half of the regular time, so    with satisfaction,   she went back home.

Yes.
       I bought   the     coat   at Harajuku. I often go Harajuku  because       at there,  there're  many shops  at Harajuku, so, I often go Harajuku.   and   I went   to    five shops. And  again,  I went to the five shops   again.     so,  at last,  I get the coat  at large shop. . So that is  very high cost,    but  it's very nice for me so  I like it.
  that coat is   pea coat.  so   I want to   get it    for long time.
