Good morning.
Yes. My name is .
Yes.
. To tell the truth, I don't have free time because my job is so busy.
And you know, we have a holiday on Saturday and Sunday.
 in these days, I have to be in office on even from nine to ten So, I wish I have a free time.
 I have a free time,
 I am going to go to skiing,
 I came from ,
and my hobby is skiing. And two weeks ago, my colleagues and I promised to go skiing to Nagano,
from Friday night to Saturday.
So Friday night we departure and on Saturday we do skiing and come back to my house on Saturday.
 it's our promise, but because of my job, I couldn't go skiing. 
 instead of going skiing,
 I was in office on Saturday.
 I fortunately, I have a chance to go skiing today from today to Sunday.
And I wish there is no problem about my job today.


Yeah.
My mother?
 I have never thought of my .
 but my mother was born in , so she is a kind of people, .
But you know, I was born in and it's been about twenty-four years her to live in , so when I talk to my mother, she never speak in . But when she speak to her mother, so my grand mother, or her sisters on the phone, she speak in . 
, then, I understand that she is people. 
Yes. And because my father gets sick and in hospital now, so she had to quit.
.
And she is taking care of my father now.
.
Yeah.
.
. 
Yes. ski . And there is a lift on the right side, but nobody is taking. And in the below of the picture, a teacher is coaching skiing to the students, I think. And in the left side, children is fighting by using snowball. And in the lodge, a couple is having a rest. and in front of the lodge, there are some skies and snow board. And in front of the ski, a snow man is standing.
. For me, skiing is not hobby, so I mean that when I came to about six years ago, so I was a student, so when I first came to , I heard that my friends from if they have a plan to go skiing, so you know, they have to go to Nagano or Niigata, so by using car or bus or train. So for them, it's a very big travel. It's a kind of travel, I think. But for me, I can see the ski from my house and it takes only about thirty minutes by car to reach the ski , so for me skiing, it's is not big hobby, so I don't think skiing is a part of my life, but it's same thing as doing circle or something. .
, it's very usual situation,
doing skiing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
. .
.
.
 Just a .
. O K.
. Yes. Thank you.
Yes, I'm going to go to New York from now, and I want to go by train. And do you have any information to go by train? So, I mean, the departure time or the cost or something. So, please tell me about it.
Ten-thirty?
 and how long does it take to get New York by that train?
 yes. what kind of trains do you have?
. . So, is there any difference on cost?
. How much does it cost to go by express?
And the local one is?
Twenty. . . Fortunately, I have a lot of time,
so I'll go by local one.
And where is the platform?
.
. O K. Thank you very much.
No, never.
Yeah.
 yeah, sure. But my hobby is traveling around Asia, so I have never been to Europe or America countries. .
Because it's just my image so it's not right, I think, but compare with the Asian people, American or European people is not kind, I think.
 and it's not that I don't like going to America, but rather than going to America, I wanted to go to Asian countries because I think I can have a lot of experience by going to Asian countries because Asian countries is very different from our situation in Japan, I think, so it's very enjoyable for me, so I have never thought of going to America.
Yeah.
.
Yes.
 yes, and can I ask you a question, please?
 . . it's not me. so, I mean,
so I start to speak by using this men or this man, "I".
. .
Yes.
O K.
Yes. one day last week, a man is driving on the orange car. And while another man was taking who is calling to his girlfriend. suddenly, the car and the bicycle crashed, and no, no, no, no, the man who was taking the bicycle's mobile phone was out of order. Moreover, his bicycle was also crashed, so the driver of the bicycle asked the driver of the car to repair his bicycle or asked to the driver of the car to give the money for the bicycle and mobile phone. but their discussing was not over, and after that, a policeman came and the policeman listen to them about the accident. and the driver of car was explain to the policeman that the reason of the accident was because the driver of bicycle was using the mobile phone while he is taking the bicycle. So, he, as the driver of car, insisted that the crash was not his responsibility. And after finished the discussing, and the driver of car gone that pickup truck came to pick the motorcycle bring it over. And the man who was taking the motorcycle was left there.
 advantage of the mobile phone?
 . I think we can call anytime, anywhere.
And if I have a plan or promise to meet someone and the place where we meet is very crowded situation, the mobile phone is very useful. .
 but I have to finish my work until ten 
 because ten o'clock, it's a departure time .
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

 Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Thank you.
