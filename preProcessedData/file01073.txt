And two weeks ago, <F>er</F> my colleagues and I <F>uh</F> promised to go skiing to Nagano,from <F>er</F> Friday night to Saturday.So <F>er</F> Friday night we departure and <F>ah</F> on Saturday <R>we</R> we do skiing and come back to my house on Saturday.<R>It's our</R> <F>um</F> it's our promise, but <F>ah</F> <.></.> <SC>my</SC> because of my job, I couldn't go skiing. <.></.><OL><nvs>sigh</nvs></OL> <F>Er</F> instead of going skiing,<laughter><R>I</R></laughter> I was in office on Saturday.<OL>So, <F>ah</F> I</OL> really want to go skiing now, and <F>ah</F> fortunately, I have a chance to go skiing today <R>from</R> <F>ah</F> from today to Sunday.And I wish <F>ah</F> there is no problem about my job today.<nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah.My mother?<F>Oh</F> I have never thought of my <laughter>mother</laughter>.<F>Um</F> but <F>um</F> my mother was born in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, so she is a kind of <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> people, <OL>I think</OL>.But <F>er</F> you know, <F>ah</F> I was born in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and <F>ah</F> it's been <R>about</R> about twenty-four years <F>ah</F> her to live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, so <F>ah</F> when I talk to my mother, <F>ah</F> she never speak in <JP>Kansaiben</JP>. But <F>ah</F> when she speak <F>ah</F> to her mother, so my grand mother, or her sisters on the phone, she speak <F>ah</F> in <JP>Kansaiben</JP>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>So</OL>, then, <F>um</F> <R>I</R> <F>um</F> I understand that <F>ah</F> she is <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> people. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes. And <JP><F>nn</F></JP> <SC>she ma</SC> <JP><F>nn</F></JP> she had a part-time job before, but <F>ah</F> because my father gets sick and in hospital now, so she had to <F>nn</F> quit.<F>Nn</F>.And she is taking care of my father now.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Ah</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes. <F>Ah</F> <.></.> it seems like <F>ah</F> ski <JP>gerende</JP>. And <F>ah</F> there is a lift on the right side, but nobody is taking. And <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> in the below of the picture, <F>ah</F> a teacher is coaching <F>ah</F> skiing to the students, I think. And <F>ah</F> in the left side, <F>ah</F> children is fighting by using snowball. And <F>ah</F> in the lodge, a couple is having a rest. <R>And</R> <F>ah</F> and <F>ah</F> in front of the lodge, <F>ah</F> there are <SC>some of</SC> <F>ah</F> some skies and snow board. And in front of the ski, a snow man is standing.<F>Nn</F>. For me, <F>ah</F> skiing is <R>not</R> <R>not</R> <F>um</F> not hobby, so I mean that <F>ah</F> when I came to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <F>ah</F> about six years ago, so I was a <H pn="school name1">XXX06</H> student, so when I first came to <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>, I heard that <R>my</R> my friends <F>ah</F> from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <F>um</F> <SC>they</SC> if <F>mm</F> they have a plan to go skiing, so <R>they</R> you know, they have to go to <F>um</F> Nagano or Niigata, so by using car or bus or train. So for them, it's a very <F>mm</F> <R>big</R> big <F>er</F> travel. It's a kind of travel, I think. But for me, <F>ah</F> I can see the <F>ah</F> ski <JP>gerende</JP> <F>er</F> from my house and it takes only about thirty minutes by car <R>to</R> <F>ah</F> to <SC?>do</SC?> reach the ski <JP>gerende</JP>, so for me <F>ah</F> <SC>it's not</SC> <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> skiing, it's is not big <F>ah</F> hobby, so <F>ah</F> I don't think <F>ah</F> skiing is a part of my life, <R>but</R> but <R>it's</R> <F>um</F> it's <F>ah</F> same thing <R>as</R> as doing circle or something. <OL><F>Um</F></OL>.<OL>So</OL>, it's very usual situation,doing skiing.Yeah.Yeah.<F>Um</F>. <F>Ah</F>.<CO>So, I have no information about</CO>.<F>Oh</F>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Just a <OL>moment, please</OL>.<F>Um</F>. <nvs>cough</nvs> O K.<JP><F>Aa</F></JP>.
