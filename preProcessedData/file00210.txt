 and the other is to check the management condition of the subsidiary  which are located  all over the world.
No way. Because   I've worked for  for  about two years. So now I don't have chance to go to  oversea on business.
But,  I don't like my job. 
   I suppose to be in a office all day. So I can't stand that. So,  actually,   I want to meet customers to negotiate,
and I want to sell  some commodity.  but, I have no chance to do that now. So,  a lot.

O K. I'd like to start.   here's a snow mountain.  there are a lot of people to play skiing.  so we can see a lot of  young boys and  young women.  and also a lodge. So,  there are four kids  playing the  snow, what can I say, so, O K.  they are throwing snowball each other.  and  in front of  me we can see the  boy   who wears the green suit.  he is throwing the snowball and hit a  opponent.   and also,  some people playing skiing, others   snowboarding.    in the lodge,   we can see two people. They are talking about something and drinking  over a cup of coffee.  and maybe,  they don't like cold winter.   O K.    the person in the black jacket   he fell to  playing the skiing. So, he slip the snow field. And,   we can see the two people in front of the picture, and maybe their relationship is,  husband and a wife. so because they are friendly playing skiing.  they are enjoy.  and the young girl  in yellow jacket and  yellow hair,
