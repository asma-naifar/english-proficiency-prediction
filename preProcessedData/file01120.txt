<H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.Yes. <F>Err</F> I am <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <F>ah</F> but <F>er</F> my real name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Yes. But I used <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> <F>err</F> when I was in the United States because <F>err</F> it's <SC>very easy and</SC> <F>er</F> <F>err</F> very easy for the native speakers to <F>err</F> memorize and <R>pronounce</R> pronounce.Yeah.Yes. Thank you, <OL><H pn="A's name">XXX01</H></OL>.Yeah, good. Yeah, but <SC>I will be</SC> I feel nervous <F>err</F> because <F>err</F> this is the first time to <F>err</F> get to work after I came back to <OL>Japan</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.O K.<OL>Relax</OL>.<F>Ah</F>. Yes. <F>Err</F> here?<F>Erm</F> near here, <F>er</F> it takes thirty minutes by train.<OL>I</OL> live in company's dormitory, yeah, <F>er</F> which is located <F>err</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.Yeah. <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <OL>line</OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. Yes, I like it <F>err</F> because <F>err</F> I can see <F>err</F> my friends. And <F>err</F> <F>er</F> when I have <F>err</F> party <F>er</F> near here, and then <R>if I</R> <F>err</F> if I drink too much and <F>er</F> if <SC?>I wo</SC?> I am drunken, <F>err</F> some friends <F>err</F> will take me to our dormitory by taxi. So it's very easy <F>err</F> <R>to</R> <F>hum</F> to commute? <OL>Not commute, but <??></??></OL>.<F>Oh</F> last time. <F>Oh</F> yes, <F>err</F> before I went to the United States, <F>err</F> my co-workers <F>err</F> had party for me. Then, <F>err</F> they <F>mm</F> made me drunken. So, I was so drunken, but my <F>err</F> senior co-worker <F>err</F> <SC>take</SC> took me to my <F>err</F> company's dormitory, and he took care of me, yeah.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>Free time</OL>?<F>Erm</F>. In Japan or <OL>in the United States</OL>?In Japan. <F>Erm</F> in Japan, <F>mmm</F> in terms of weekends, every Saturday, I practice playing American football<F>er</F> with my co-workers. I belong to <F>er</F> company's American football team, and this year, I'm a captain.Yeah, so <F>err</F> while I was in the United States, <SC>I practiced</SC> I worked out very much, and <F>err</F> I strengthened my muscle, and <F>err</F> I ate very much <F>err</F> to gain my weight.<laughter>Yes</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. O K. <F>Err</F> in this pictures, <F>err</F> there is one teacher, and <SC>the</SC> <R>there</R> there are, one, two, three, four, five, six students. <F>Err</F> I think <F>err</F> it is a mathematics class. <F>Err</F> teacher teaches mathematics in <?>earnest</?>, but <F>err</F> the students <F>mm</F> don't pay attention to the class. <F>Err</F> some of them, <F>err</F> <SC>just</SC> <F>err</F> I think just one of them, <F>err</F> taking a class <F>err</F> in <?>earnest</?>, but <F>er</F> other peoples are terrible. <F>Er</F> for example, <F>err</F> <R>the man</R> the man <F>err</F> close to the window is chewing gum, and <F>err</F> he <F>err</F> looks out of the class, and behind him, <F>err</F> there are two girls, <F>err</F> who are chatting with each other, and <F>err</F> in the center of this class, <F>err</F> there is one guy who is drinking and <F>err</F> who is listening to the C D. <.></.> And <F>err</F> <.></.> <F>err</F> this student, <F>err</F> this girl is <F>mm</F> typing message<OL><laughter>yeah</laughter></OL>, by using cell phone.Yeah.<F>Hu-huh</F>.Atmosphere. <F>Ah</F> completely different from Japanese class.I mean, <F>err</F> for example, in <F>er</F> Japanese university, <F>err</F> the style, the teaching style and the <R>takin</R> taking style is different. I mean, in Japan, there is one teacher, and he is just <F>er</F> teaching <SC>and one way</SC> like a one way. So <F>err</F> the students don't <F>er</F> make questions. So <F>err</F> in the United States, <F>err</F> in my English class, <F>err</F> teacher tries to <F>err</F> make us make questions. So, they are trying to have a conversation with students. So, <F>um</F> I think <F>err</F> <SC>the level</SC> <F>ah</F> not level, I mean style, so lecture style is different from American class and Japanese class.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Hum</F>.<OL><F>Hu-huh</F></OL>.<F>Hum</F>.<OL><F>Hu-huh</F></OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hum</F>.O K.Hello. <F>Err</F> I'd like to refund <F>err</F> my trip <F>err</F> because I took a tour of your company and I went to the United States,<OL>and</OL> I went to the Cincinnati to <F>err</F> <F>err</F> watch a game <F>err</F> with <SC>Reds and Ast</SC> <F>err</F> Reds and <F>err</F> Yankees.<OL>Yes</OL>. So <F>err</F> before I went there, <F>err</F> I have the pamphlet <R>about</R> about it, and it said <F>err</F> I will be able to have a good dinner, and <F>err</F> I will be able to stay <F>err</F> at <F>err</F> very good hotel, but <F>err</F> the reality is completely different. I mean, I went to Cincinnati, and <F>err</F> <F>err</F> in the Cincinnati's stadium, <F>err</F> while I was watching the game, <F>err</F> I couldn't have any dinner, so I had to have <F>err</F> hot dog by myself.<F>Hu-huh</F>. Time?<F>Hum</F> but <F>err</F> there, I called your company, but <R>your</R> <F>err</F> your company answered <F>err</F> your company didn't prepare for our dinner, so this is <F>ah</F> <F>err</F> <SC>one different</SC> one difference, and also, after the game, I went to the <SC>Cinati</SC> Cincinnati hotel, and <F>err</F> my pamphlet said <R>I</R> <F>err</F> I would be able to stay <SC>a good hote</SC> in a good room, but <SC>the room is very</SC> <F>mm</F> the room's terrible. I mean, <F>err</F> I was supposed to stay in the suite room,yeah, but <F>err</F> the hotel said <F>err</F> your company didn't <F>err</F> make a reservation for suite room, so I had to stay at the <F>err</F> lower class room.Nice room? But I took picture. Here.<OL>But <F>err</F> now</OL> <F>er</F> we are talking about <OL>on the phones</OL>.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. O K.<F>Erm</F> difference. <F>Oh</F> and I have a <F>err</F> picture of suite room.<OL><??></??></OL>.<OL><??></??> you know</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.<F>Hu-huh</F>.Yes.<F>Hu-huh</F>.Thank you very much.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Ah</F> no, the season was finished.<OL>Yes</OL>.Yeah, baseball game. But actually, <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> at the game, <F>err</F> the Reds <F>er</F> lost the game, so I and my friends <F>err</F> left there<OL><laughter><??></??></laughter></OL> early.<OL>Too bad</OL>. Yeah.<F>Um</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.<F>Hu-huh</F>. <F>Erm</F> how long can I <F>erm</F> prepare?<OL>Very short</OL>.O K. Thirty seconds <??></??>.O K.<OL><F>Err</F></OL> one day last week, <F>er</F> Taro and Shinichi <F>er</F> went to the restaurant. <F>Err</F> Taro is a father of Shinichi. <F>Err</F> <F>err</F> <SC>that day was</SC> <F>err</F> I mean, Taro <F>err</F> wanted to <SC>have a</SC> have dinner for Shinichi's university graduation. So, <F>err</F> <SC>Shin</SC> <F>err</F> Taro <F>err</F> wanted to celebrate <F>err</F> for his graduation. So, <F>erm</F> while <F>ah</F> they were walking the street, <F>err</F> they found a good restaurant, so they entered the restaurant. <F>Ah</F> Taro found the good table <F>err</F> so <F>err</F> Taro asked the waiter <F>err</F> to have dinner at the table. <F>Um</F> then, at the table, <F>erm</F> Taro said to Shinichi, <F>er</F> "You can have anything you want.". So <F>err</F> Shinichi ordered <F>err</F> beer and <F>er</F> fish dishes and <F>err</F> a lot of <F>mm</F> <?>other</?> meals. And Taro also ordered a chicken and a wine and <F>err</F> a salad. <F>Err</F> they had a <F>err</F> good dinner <F>err</F> and <F>er</F> they had a good conversation. After eating dinner, <F>err</F> Taro <F>err</F> treated Shinichi. Yeah. Because <F>err</F> Shinichi <F>er</F> was <F>err</F> <SC>still universi</SC> <F>err</F> <SC>just</SC> <F>err</F> right after graduation of university, so Shinichi didn't have <F>err</F> any money, so Taro treated Shinichi. <F>Hum</F>. After dinner, <F>err</F> Shinichi had <F>er</F> another plan to meet his friends, so <F>err</F> he left <F>err</F> there, and they said to each other, "Good-bye.".<OL><F>Hu-huh</F></OL>.<F>Hu-huh</F>.Yes.<OL>Every guy</OL>, so <F>erm</F> when I was in the United States, I said to <OL><R>every</R> everyone</OL>Here, also. So, I mean, <F>err</F> <?>at seminar</?> <F>err</F> there were four <H pn="company name1">XXX05</H> guys, of us.

So, <F>err</F> it's very <F>err</F> weired<OL>here</OL> to call <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. <OL>But</OL><F>err</F> when we are speaking in English, <F>err</F> it's very natural <F>eh</F> for him to call me <OL><H pn="B's name">XXX02</H></OL>.So, <F>err</F> <F>err</F> the before, <OL><F>err</F></OL>he called me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Yeah.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes, I think so.<OL><?>Yeah</?></OL>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.Thank you.<F>Hu-huh</F>.Thank you very much.
