How are you?Friday, I go to a school to study English from one to three p.m. So, after finish <?>this thing</?>, I've got to go to school.Actually I'm learning <F>erm</F> English interpretation,at a special school in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.It's really difficult and hard.<??></??> <OL>requirement</OL>.I think, you know, I <SC>need to learn <F>er</F> <.></.> more</SC> <F>er</F> need new words each time at class. And I'm a slow learner and <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can't, you know, keep up with every new thing each time. So, it's quite hard.<F>Well</F> I go back to home. And I know I'm supposed to, you know, review and study for next class, but <laughter>usually</laughter>, I do some reading and watch T V and call friends and stuffs like that.<F>Ah</F> I live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.Really, you know, close to here. <R>Two</R> two stops. <F>Hmm</F>.Yes.

And when I first got here, I was so, you know, surprised by so many people. And, you know, the big traffic and everything. And, you know, people in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> speak <F>er</F> <SC>very unique</SC> like unique way in speaking Japanese. And it took me sometime to get used to, you know, speak <F>er</F> standard Japanese.<OL><laughter>You know</laughter>, <SC>the</SC></OL> there were nice and warm weather. And food and my friends and family.<laughter>Yeah, I guess so</laughter>.O K. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> I think this is <.></.> in a ski resort. Many people are skiing. <.></.> <F>Uh</F>. There's a lift <.></.> in the back. <.></.> And there's a guy, I don't know, maybe it's a girl, can't tell, <F>er</F> just <.></.> slipped. And one person is snowboarding. <.></.> And four kids <.></.> are playing, <.></.> you know, <R>sn</R> <SC>snow</SC> <F>er</F> throwing snow balls. And <.></.> there's <F>er</F> snowman, too. <.></.> And these people <.></.> are really having fun, <.></.> looks like it.<OL>Yeah</OL>.For the first time, <F>erm</F> you know, my first experience of snow <SC>is</SC> <.></.> was when I was <F>em</F> twelve. <.></.> I traveled to Hokkaido and saw the snow for the first time. And <F>well</F> it was really exciting, you know, <laughter>as a child</laughter>. <R>I</R> I' d never seen any snow in my home in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And <SC>like</SC> it was like dream and <nvs>laughter</nvs> you know, <R>I</R> <.></.> I had so much fun playing with the snow with my friends. And it's really a nice memory.<F>Ah</F> yeah.It was very difficult.<F>Ah</F> Because I'm no athlete. <.></.> And, <.></.> you know, I just <.></.> couldn't start or <.></.> if I <.></.> got to start then I couldn't stop, so. <.></.> Maybe ski is not, you know, my kind of <laughter>thing to do</laughter>.Yes.Hello.<F>Oh</F>. Yes. <.></.> <R>You</R> you know, I feel <??></??> ago, <F>erm</F> <.></.> I bought this watch <.></.> and it seems really nice when I <R>s</R> <.></.> saw this <.></.> at this shop. But after I got home, I thought, you know, this is not the <R>exact</R> exact thing I was looking for. So, I was wondering, you know, if I can get <.></.> refund or <.></.> change to something else.<.></.> You know, I wanted to have a <SC>watch like really light</SC> light watch and have a dark color. But I thought <SC>this was</SC> this is the color I wanted. But maybe because the lighting and everything, <.></.> this is the <SC>quite</SC> little bit <R>dif</R> different from <.></.> the kind of color I wanted to get. So, I was wondering if I can get another color or if you don't have one. <.></.> Because, you know, <SC>this is</SC> I just <.></.> purchased it a few hours ago and <.></.> I haven't, you know, even used it yet. <CO>So, this is</CO>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. I <laughter>just trying, you know</laughter>. <.></.> Customers do things like that <.></.> <SC>at</SC> <.></.> you know, at stores like. <.></.>Why? <nvs>laughter</nvs>Thank you very much.Thank you. Then, I'll be waiting for you.Yes?<.></.> <F>Well</F> luckily, no. Never.Yeah. I think, you know, <F>er</F> <.></.> people need to check <.></.> like <F>er</F> the thing they <.></.> wanted to get before the purchasing it. And <.></.> I don't think it's a good idea to buy a thing <.></.> like for the <R>first sig</R> first sight. <.></.> <F>Er</F>. People need to <.></.> think <F>er</F> and rethink if <R>it's</R> it is really necessary or <.></.> it is really a good buy.Thank you.May I begin?O K. One day last week, at eight o'clock in the morning, <F>er</F> Mr. Suzuki <.></.> <F>er</F> is on his way to work as usual. And he got to the station. And <.></.> it is <.></.> really crowded <.></.> as the usual morning. And he was standing <F>er</F> next to <.></.> <R>two</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> two gentlemen. And <.></.> the two people were really engaged in <.></.> a conversation. And <.></.> one guy unintentionally hit Mr. Suzuki. And Mr. Suzuki dropped <R>his</R> <.></.> his bag <F>ern</F> to the <.></.> railroad. And Mr. Suzuki claimed to the person. But there was nothing they can do. So, <F>er</F> they were just <.></.> <F>er</F> standing. And there comes a train. And Mr. Suzuki <F>er</F> went almost crazy, because <.></.> he thought it might crash his <.></.> bag. Maybe <F>er</F> something <.></.> important was in his bag. And after passing the train, the bag was still there. And Mr. Suzuki seemed really relieved. Then came the <F>er</F> <.></.> personnel of the station. And <.></.> <R>pick</R> <.></.> picked <.></.> Mr. Suzuki's bag. And, again, everything was settled.Thank you.<.></.> <F>Well</F> <.></.> no. I would ask, you know, the personnel at the station, <.></.> first thing.Because it is dangerous to go down <.></.> to the <F>er</F> railroad and <.></.> because, you know, anytime a train <.></.> can come and <.></.> you might get killed.<.></.> Yes. It's really a sad thing. And <.></.> I <SC>usu</SC> <.></.> often feel like, you know, it's really dangerous just, you know, to stand on the platform of the station. So, a lot of <.></.> safety procedures <.></.> needs to be installed <.></.> in every station, I think.<.></.> For example, maybe <F>erm</F> <.></.> put <R>a</R> <.></.> a <.></.> wall, so people, even drunk people cannot <.></.> <SC>go down to the</SC> <.></.> go down. <SC>Or</SC> <.></.> <F>mm</F> and I also think like <SC>many</SC> <F>uh</F> more station personnels need to be at the platforms, make sure <.></.> for the safety.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.This weekend? <.></.> Tomorrow I'm going to go to see a movie with a friend of mine. And <.></.> maybe we'll go <.></.> to eat lunch and <.></.> have really nice conversation, <OL>I hope</OL>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
