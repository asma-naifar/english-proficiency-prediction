A little nervous, I mean.
Yeah. The longer I wait, more nervous I get. Yeah.
Yeah.
. Not really.
I can get off work at five thirty
to six o'clock.

 mostly, from Japanese to English.
But, sometimes, from 
English to Japanese.
. the translation is maybe, about eighty percent of my entire job 
this company.
. Rest of it is like a filing documents, and
yeah, reading mails.
Yeah, I do.
. I can always use English.
 
yeah, the reason why I went to the United States because I like to learn English.
.
 . I went to the university and graduated from there.
. I went to and lived with a host family for two years.
And I rented the apartment and lived alone
for two years. Yeah. .
. They got host mother and father.
And the host father was 
 for 
 at that time, 
already retired now. 
yeah, and they are Christians.
So, they took me to the church every .

 so I was kind of looking forward to 
with them. Because 
could have lunch at a restaurant
.
Yeah.
I thought so. .
. . The parents don't really demand things to their children.
 and children are also more independent,
and actually, the biggest thing I was surprised was that there is bad rela not real bad relationship between mother and her daughter-in-law.
Yeah.
So they
get along very well. .
Yeah.

A picture? .
Describe it? . There is a house, and two boys are playing with ball. And a girl is also playing outside. And it's sunny day. And O K, O K, two women are talking on the street, and also, a man from that house. And one man is jogging. 
. Also there is a cat on the car parked up along the road. It's in front of that house. . .

Living in a house?
. O K. . people living in a house has a garden.
 . They've got more room.
And nervous
 making noises. .
.
 in Japan, houses are really close to each other. So most houses don't have gardens because the . the people living there don't get .
. and in Japan, we most have walls,
 yeah, 
 to separate from each other.
. But, in , there is no houses that has walls around the house.

.
O K.
Yeah.
. Yes. I was wondering that if I can return this ticket and get refund because I missed the train that I was supposed to get in. so, because of . . Yeah, yeah. 
 but actually, I took other train, the train to get here.
And that train was also delayed, so that's why I couldn't make it for this train.
. .
Yes.
.

 . I'm hurry because I have a very important appointment to attend. And, if I miss this appointment, I will lose my job.
.
 Thank you.
Thank you 
much. I appreciate it.

O K.
.
 .
. .
. In general, I think it's O K.
But, sometimes, there are very nasty clerks.
And the attendance on the train
are sometimes, say for example, when an accident occurres, the attendance makes an announcement about the accident. but they always apologize.
And don't explain what happened.
So, what we would like to know is what happened, ,
how long take to start the trains. But they don't really explain just keep apologizing.
.


O K. .

O K, O K. .
O K. . when I was driving a motorcycle, I was talking to my girlfriend on the cellular phone. . I was so into speaking with my girlfriend I didn't realize that the car was coming to me. And the car hit me. . And my motorcycle was broken. . Yeah. so I talked to the driver of the car. But that driver complained to me that that was my fault, because I was using a cellphone. And he told that fact to the policeman. . But, somehow, the policeman understood that the primary cause of the accident was due to some negligence of that driver.
So the driver agreed to repair my motorcycle under his insurance and called a car repair company. And the company took my bicycle away.
 actually, at that time, I was going to meet up that girlfriend. But I was late, and she really got angry.
But, when I explained what happened, she understood and everything was settled.
Yes, .
. when I went to the grocery store in , I parked my car at the parking lot. And, after I did shopping and came back to the car, I pulled off my car from the parking area. Then, the old lady who was also driving a 
and pulling off her car
 car from the side.
. She didn't realize I was there.
So she didn't know what happened.
And I complained to her. But she didn't really, you know, accept my complaint.
. But I suggested to go to police.
And, while we went to the police, some lady left a card on my car. And she said that she saw the accident. So, if I need help, she told me to call her,
 she could be, maybe, .
 the police said that from that situation.
Yeah, . .
