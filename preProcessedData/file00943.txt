It's very nice<??></??> live, I think.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Oh</F> my favorite town?<OL>Yeah</OL>. <F>Urm</F> yeah, I think <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> is my favorite because <F>urm</F> firstly, town is very beautiful. The buildings and walls. And also the people is very interesting.<OL>It looks</OL> like, you know, a little bit different from the people in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> or <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <F>Urm</F> I mean <R>the</R> their fashion is<OL>special</OL>.Yeah.<F>Urm</F> <.></.> it is difficult to explain but <F>urm</F> their fashion is very advancedand <SC>very <F>ur</F> <.></.> strong or</SC> the color is very strong.So yeah, it is very fun toonly see them.Yeah.Yeah. <F>Urm</F> I like taking photos.<OL>And</OL> recently, I made homepagefor my photos.So I sometime go to <.></.> <F>urm</F> a lot of <SC>place</SC> places and then take photos and upload the photos to <SC>ho</SC> my homepage.<F>Urm</F> last summer, I went to <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>.And at <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>, I <.></.> go to the <F>urm</F> <H pn="others6">XXX07</H> which is <H pn="others6">XXX07</H>. It is a very short course for <SC>the</SC> <F>ur</F> studying taking photography. And I did that course. And then, I start <F>urr</F> taking photos very interesting.Before that, I've never <.></.> doing that.<F>Urrm</F> one is the technique because we have to <F>urm</F> <.></.> pay attention to the light. It is a little bit different from <.></.> seeing with your eyes. You know, it's a different. And so you have to <.></.> be aware of that differences.And we have to image <F>urm</F> how the photography <F>urm</F> developed. And then, we have to shoot.So that imagination is the most difficult thing, I think.Yeah.<F>Urm</F> here is a room. And there is one woman and there is one dog and one cat. And one woman is sitting in a chair and she is pointing the computers. <F>Urm</F> the dog is, I think, sleeping on the floor and the cat is sleeping on a bed. And the door is half-opened. And in the room there's <F>urm</F> audio, and computers, <SC>desks</SC> desk and word processor, I think. <F>Uhm</F> yeah, that's all.<F>Uh-huh</F>.How open? What do you mean by how?Process? <F>Urm</F> firstly, I have to, of course, make the contents.So I made contents by <nvs>cough</nvs> special applicationwhich is <F>ur</F> for making homepages.And I made the contents.Like, you know, it's like <F>urm</F> writing <.></.> your report by <SC>word proce</SC> <F>urr</F> Word or something like that.It's very near to that. And then, I have to <nvs>cough</nvs> get my address. So I call my provider. And I get my <R>pro</R> provider.And then, I upload my contents to my address by <F>urm</F> <F>urm</F> again special <.></.> software.Yes.<F>Uhm</F> <F>urm</F> my room is <SC>very <F>urm</F> <.></.> near to <R>this</R> <.></.> this</SC> very similar to this room because I have computer <F>urm</F> in my room. But my computer is <F>urm</F> notebook.So that's the big difference.And I have also audio and bed. But <F>urm</F> in my room, there is no animals because now, <F>urm</F> there is no animal in my house.So that's second differences. <F>Urmm</F> <F>urm</F> also I have a window and clock. So it's very similar <OL>to this room</OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Oh</F> O K.<laughter>O K</laughter>.<F>Urm</F> I have reserved my seat on a train.But <F>urr</F> <.></.> I was late.And I missed the train. So I want exchange <F>ur</F> this <.></.> ticket <.></.>to another one.<OL>Is it</OL> possible to do this?<.></.> <F>Ur</F> but how can I do with <R>this</R> <F>ur</F> this ticket?Really? But <F>urm</F> I didn't use it. So <OL><F>urm</F></OL>I think I could get <F>urmm</F> <.></.> the enough money for the ticket, isn't it?<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Well</F> so how about discounting the new ticket? Is it possible <OL><?>today</?></OL>?<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh-huh</F>. Yeah, <F>urm</F> I have a <.></.> reason <F>urm</F> that is my <.></.> train, I mean that I come here by train and that train was <F>ur</F> delayed.So that is the reason, <R>is</R> isn't it? <OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Urm</F> no, because it was because of the accident.Yeah.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Really?<F>Well</F> but <R>I</R> I really <nvs>laughter</nvs> have an accident and I was <F>uhh</F> <F>urr</F> late for that.<F>Urm</F> so <.></.> O K. <CO>So you mean there is no way to</CO>. <F>Uum</F>.<F>Uhu</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.Please.Yes.<F>Oh</F> yeah. There are subway <F>er</F> but <F>urm</F> that time, I didn't get on the subway.But I went to <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> also in last <F>ur</F> winter.And that time, I get on the subway.And <R>I</R> I've heard that the <H pn="others5">XXX06</H> subway is very dangerousand it's very dirty.But it was a little bit differentfrom what I heard.<F>Urm</F> yes, it is true that <F>urm</F> <.></.> the train was dirty<OL>and</OL> there was some <.></.> graffiti on the walls.But it's not <F>ur</F> <.></.> dangerous at all, <OL>I think</OL>.So we could <F>ur</F> get on even in night subway.<F>Urm</F> yeah.No. With my father.Yeah.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.O K. <F>Urm</F> this story is about <F>ur</F> in the last week. <F>Urm</F> on the road, there was <.></.> a couple walking <.></.> and it was raining that day. And suddenly, the man <.></.> heard <SC>something</SC> some voice. And <R>it was the</R> <F>urm</F> <F>huh</F> <.></.> it was the <F>urr</F> <SC>voice of</SC> voice from the cat.And so he look around and found the cat in the box. And then, <F>urm</F> a woman <.></.> wants to <F>uhm</F> bring back home the cat. But a man said, "No, we can't do it". But <F>urm</F> a woman really wants to <.></.> bring the cat back. So <F>urm</F> she <??></??> <F>urm</F> the boyfriend. And then, they <F>urr</F> get the <.></.> cat back to hometogether.Yeah. I had two cats <.></.> <OL>in my house</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Because <F>ur</F> my family love cats.<F>Urmm</F> not dogs. <OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Urm</F> because <SC>cats is not so</SC> you know, <F>urm</F> <.></.> cats <SC>is not so <F>urm</F> royalty</SC> <.></.> don't have so much royalty to their owner.And I think it's very cute. And also my family thinks that.<F>Oh</F> yeah. <F>Uhm</F> one of my cats <.></.> is <R>very</R> <F>urm</F> <.></.> very smart. <F>Urm</F> it is she. <F>Er</F> she can open the door <OL><SC>by sh</SC></OL>by herself.<F>Urm</F> it's not the door like <F>urm</F> the balls of the door but it is like this one.So she get on the tableand then she jumped to the <R>han</R> <F>urm</F> handle of the door. Then she <F>urm</F> touch the handle, then she can open it.And so <R>we</R> <F>urm</F> <.></.> we make the key which is like this one <.></.> to the door. But she can <R>even</R> even open <SC>this one</SC> this key because she punch <.></.> from the,you know, beneath. And she unlock it. And then she can open door.Yeah. And so this is my most interesting memory<OL><SC>of the cat</SC> of them</OL>.<F>Urr</F> <.></.> I think <F>urm</F> we can feel that when <.></.> we go back home alone, <.></.> because <R>if there is no family</R> <.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>if there is no family in a home,you <.></.> would feel a little bit loneliness. But if there is <SC>a</SC> <.></.> <SC>some animal</SC> some <.></.> life <R>in the</R> in the house, you can feel a little bit warm. And you can talk with the cats. So, that is the best advantage to <SC>keep</SC> <?>holding a</?> <F>ur</F> pets.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.O K.<F>Urm</F> I have to go to the dentist<OL>after this</OL>, because <SC>I <F>urm</F> ju</SC> I've just <.></.> take my, <.></.> I forgot the word of the teeth but<OL>yeah</OL>, one of the teeth yesterday.So I have to go to the <SC>do</SC> dentist and let him see it.<F>Urm</F> it's in Yoyogi-Uehara.<OL>So</OL> it's very near <OL>from here</OL>.Yeah.Yes. <CO><OL>I'm a university</OL></CO>.<F>Er</F> yeah.
