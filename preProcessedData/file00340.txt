So <F>ah</F> it's a little <laughter>sleepy</laughter>.By radio.<F>Ah</F> get here?<SC>Get up</SC> not get up?By bus and train. Very long, but I love <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> very much. Do you come <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>?<F>Ah</F>.Very old.People is old, and the way of thinking is very old. Me, too. But <F>umm</F> I love <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.<OL><R>Very</R></OL> very conservative, I mean.<F>Ahh</F> we don't like <F>mm</F> changing.<CO>So</CO>.<F>Ahh</F> <?>there are changing that</?> <F>ah</F> <F>mm</F> there are <.></.> politician, I mean.They are always <F>ah</F> chose the same person to elect so <F>ah</F> chairperson or <F>mm</F> <SC>mayor man</SC> mayor person is always the same person <SC>in the</SC> so it's difficult to create new thing in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>.<?>It's my country</?>.Yes. With my mother and my father and also my cat.<SC>My</SC> both my parents are retired already so <nvs>cough</nvs> they have a lot of time. And my mother retired <F>ur</F> one month ago. So <R>she began</R> <F>ah</F> she began to study English, and <laughter>I'm a teacher</laughter>.To <R>your</R> <F>ah</F> your close family. <nvs>laughter</nvs>You get <F>a</F> <F>ah</F> easily <laughter>anger</laughter>."Why <SC>can't you</SC> <laughter><F>ahh</F></laughter> <R>ca</R> can't you understand this?". <nvs>laughter</nvs> It's <F>ur</F> easy so <F>ah</F> I have to <F>ah</F> put <F>ah</F> little distance from her. So we can <F>uh</F> keep a good relation as a teacher and student.No. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.O K. <SC>There is a</SC> <F>ah</F> it's a scene of class. <R>I</R> <F>ah</F> I think it's a mathematics class. And there are one, two, three, four, five, <R>six stu</R> <F>ah</F> <SC>six students</SC> seven students and <F>umm</F> one teacher. And teacher is instructing some difficult <F>ah</F> <R>mathmatics</R> mathematics. <F>Ahh</F> but <SC>they</SC> <F>hmm</F> <SC>almost</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>two</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>near</SC> only one student is listening carefully. And <SC>other</SC> <SC>others does</SC> others don't listen. Maybe <R>they</R> <F>ur</F> they don't like teacher, or they don't like mathematics, but it's a typical Japanese <F>er</F> class in today, I think.You mean today's Japanese class?I think <F>hmm</F> <R>today's</R> <F>ah</F> today's Japanese <F>er</F> class is <F>am</F> little difficult situation from <R>two</R> two point. One point is that <SC>students doesn't</SC> <F>ah</F> students don't like to study because <F>er</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> they are lack of <?>faith</?>. And <F>mm</F> other point is <F>em</F> teacher's lack of ability. I mean they can't scold them out. <SC>Sco</SC> and they can't point out what's wrong. And <R>that's</R> that's a problem of <R>our</R> <F>ahh</F> our countries, I think.<SC>I'm</SC> do you know <JP>juku</JP> in Japanese?I'm a <JP>juku</JP> tutor.No.I <F>um</F> mainly teach <F>ahh</F> two students <F>ah</F> each. It's a personal children in <JP>juku</JP>. So <SC>they don't</SC> <F>ah</F> when person to person, they stay silent, calm, and they listen to me. But <SC>if he</SC> if they <nvs>laughter</nvs> become more numbers, <F>ah</F> about forty or thirty, they become <nvs>laughter</nvs> like this.What kind of?<F>Fmmm</F>.O K.<?><JP>Ta,ta,ta,ta</JP></?>.Hello, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.

So I can't go there. I'm so sorry.<F>Oh</F> I forgot it. <nvs>laughter</nvs>O K. <F>Ahh</F>. Another day, I'm going to <SC>make</SC> <F>ah</F> hold a party for them.<F>Ah</F> and <SC>it's</SC> <F>an</F> <R>can you</R> can you excuse <R>for</R> <F>ah</F> for that?<F>Ah</F> <SC>she's becoming</SC> <F>ahm</F> <F>ah</F> she's stay <F>ahh</F> in a hospital.<CO><OL>And</OL></CO>. <laughter><?>Yeah</?></laughter>. <OL>I'll be there</OL>.<?>Thank you</?>.See you then.Thank you very much.In Japan?<F>Ah</F> we don't have much parties so I've never been this kind of situation.<laughter>No, no</laughter>.No. We don't like <laughter><?>be gather</?></laughter>.I watch <F>ah</F> <F>umm</F> movies <?>in movies</?>.

And that's all.Yes. <nvs>laughter</nvs>French. <SC>There are no person</SC> <F>ah</F> there isn't any person who speak French in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. So it's a very difficult to contact to <F>ah</F> <F>um</F> <R>active French</R> active <F>ah</F> French speaker. <F>Ah</F> so <F>ah</F> if you study English, there are lot of materials, <F>ah</F> radio and TV or newspapers. But <F>ahh</F> when it comes to French, it's <F>ah</F> not so much <F>ah</F> material or texts. So it's the point of <F>ah</F> difficult.<OL><F>Ahhh</F> maybe</OL>.O K.
