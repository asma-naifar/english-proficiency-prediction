Hello.
My name is .
Nice to meet you, too.
 very good.
I live in . Do you know ?
Very countryside from .
It tooks one hour or two hours
 to come here. So it's a little .
By radio.
 get here?
 not get up?
By bus and train. Very long, but I love very much. Do you come ?
.
Very old.
People is old, and the way of thinking is very old. Me, too. But I love . 
Yeah.
 very conservative, I mean.
 we don't like changing.
.
 there are politician, I mean.
They are always chose the same person to elect so chairperson or mayor person is always the same person so it's difficult to create new thing in .
.
.
Yes. With my mother and my father and also my cat.
 both my parents are retired already so they have a lot of time. And my mother retired one month ago. So she began to study English, and .
To your close family. 
You get easily .
"Why can't you understand this?". It's easy so I have to put little distance from her. So we can keep a good relation as a teacher and student.
No. 
Yes.
O K. it's a scene of class. I think it's a mathematics class. And there are one, two, three, four, five, seven students and one teacher. And teacher is instructing some difficult mathematics. but only one student is listening carefully. And others don't listen. Maybe they don't like teacher, or they don't like mathematics, but it's a typical Japanese class in today, I think.
You mean today's Japanese class?
I think today's Japanese class is little difficult situation from two point. One point is that students don't like to study because they are lack of . And other point is teacher's lack of ability. I mean they can't scold them out. and they can't point out what's wrong. And that's a problem of our countries, I think.
 do you know in Japanese?
I'm a tutor.
No.
I mainly teach two students each. It's a personal children in . So when person to person, they stay silent, calm, and they listen to me. But if they become more numbers, about forty or thirty, they become like this.
What kind of?
.
O K.
.
Hello, this is . Thank you for inviting me to dinner party, but I can't go because my mother's illness.
 please say hello to them. it's difficult.
I love my mother. So I can't go there. I'm so sorry.
 I forgot it. 
O K. . Another day, I'm going to hold a party for them.
 and can you excuse for that?
 she's stay in a hospital.
.
.
See you then.
Thank you very much.
In Japan?
 we don't have much parties so I've never been this kind of situation.
.
No. We don't like .
I watch movies . And read books, or I also study French so I study French. And that's all.
Yes. 
French. there isn't any person who speak French in . So it's a very difficult to contact to active French speaker. so if you study English, there are lot of materials, radio and TV or newspapers. But when it comes to French, it's not so much material or texts. So it's the point of difficult.
 maybe.
O K. Is it me?
O K. last Saturday, I went to department store, and I bought a tie for my boyfriend. And I paid twenty thousand yen for it. But I found a in the same store nice clothes in the same store. So I bought both of them. and I back to my home. It's very expensive .
