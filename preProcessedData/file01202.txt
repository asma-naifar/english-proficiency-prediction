.
Yes. My name is .
Nice to meet you, .
I live in .
.
 when I first moved forty some years ago, I didn't like it.
But now I like it. I like the 's administration.
 of the I think it's one of the top level administration in Japan.
.
 many areas like old people's care and environmental problems and they have very nice policies.
.
No, I live in a house.
. With my little bird,
Ray . 
 Ray is a parakeet.
And it was given to me when my mother passed away.
 one of my niece said that " you must be very lonely, so I will give this bird as a birthday present.
So is a male bird. And he speaks Japanese very well, he speaks English, too.
. 
.
Ray . the first thing I do after I get up in the morning, you know, I clean the cage every morning and then give food
I'll open the door of the cage 
he'll, you know, fly I mean in the house. So he is just like a family member.
.
. And he comes on my shoulder and he keeps talking and talking and talking. 
.
 he said when the American university's exchange student came to Japan,
 one of them became sick.
And so I asked him quite often " are you O K,
 O K?". And then Ray copied me
, "Are you O K, are you O K?"
 he knows what it really means. So he says "Are you O K?" in an appropriate time.

.
?
. I retired from work about nine year ago. And so much of my time is spent for hobbies. I learn Japanese calligraphy and I just started taking lessons on pressed flower art.
And I take lessons on ballroom dance. 
 so that keeps me quite busy. .
.
Maybe I'm doing too much
 for my age.

 I'm not athletic. yeah you know, I joined the fitness club a number of times, but I gave up every time. And so I needed to do some exercise as I, you know, get older, I thought that I should do something. And that was the reason why I started taking lessons on the ballroom dancing.
 I can enjoy not exercise
 just repeat the exercise, but I can enjoy and 
it's difficult how to, you know, make the right movement,
 challenging.
.
I see. this is a residential area, I think. And it's a very nice day with the sun shining. And there is a nice house. And in front of the house, a little girl is jumping rope, and two boys are playing volleyball, and two cats are talking. jogging. And two ladies are talking. one lady has a dog, and one lady probably just got off the car. And the cat is sleeping on the car. And on the opposite side of the street is a gentleman reading a newspaper in front of his house.
.
.
 the residential area in this picture is envious because it has a large garden while where my house is that the houses are crowded so there's not much space between the .
I have a small garden. someone says the as large as a cat's . But my garden is a mouse forehead. 
.
So there's much open space in this picture, but not so in my house.
.
Yeah.
O K.
Hi, this is . How are you?
I'm O K.
.
So by the way, thank you very much for inviting me for the dinner party.
But unfortunately, my friend from America is coming on this day
 I have to go to the airport to meet her. And I'm really sorry that I'll miss this chance, but I'm very much interested in coming to your dinner party. So when you have another occasion, please just let me know.
 yeah, but she is arriving very late
 in the evening. we may come back maybe 
 ten or eleven.
 it's depend upon the traffic condition.
So I can't say but it will be late.
. And plane may arrive on time or maybe late.
So I really want to go myself, but as such, I would wait until next time.
But thank you very much for the invitation, anyway.
For me?
. let me see. When I get back to the town, I will call you, and if your party is still on, I will certainly come.
O K.
 extend my apologies the to those people who are at the party.
.

Yes. not quite often.
 several times a year.
.
? It was 
Yes. they are not my friends but they are my neighbors,
but to go back, I have a friend in Spain. She is Japanese.
But she's living in Spain,
 visited her some years ago and she taught me how to cook 
paella. So I practiced several times, and now I can cook paella. And when I cooked, I invited the neighbors to my house. But usually I have a sukiyaki party for my friend from Spain. She comes back to Japan maybe once or twice a year. And each time I invite her and our common friends at my house.
. It's always sukiyaki .
Because she wants .

.

Or someday, I would like to invite you
to my .

.
.
.
 of course, take the train to go to the Mister Uchida go to the office every day and uses this station. And one day last week, he was waiting for the train. But the persons next to him were talking and they were so enthusiastic about their talk that so one man's arm hit him. And he dropped his briefcase off the platform. Now he needs to take it before the train comes, but it was too late. The train was pulling in, but after the train, he worried about his briefcase. It might be broken. But after the train ran away, he knew that his briefcase was safe. And he asked the station clerk to pick it up for him. And he finally got it to his relief. .
?
 yes.
How
 make it? know if I can .
But we need some materials. materials like shrimp, shellfish. And Spanish people use I do not know English names, but . But I don't use this. I don't like it. It's
 and it doesn't look nice to me.
So I skip . But I need squid, I need white-meat fish and I need green hot pepper, red hot pepper and green beans.
 and then I prepare these cut and seasoned and then I not fry, bake it on the frying pan.
And then put it aside. And then what do I ? And then, prepared things with rice
without washing.
Rice. And then put the soup made of consomme and saffron.
 English 
but saffron. And then cook it on the paella pan.
A very .
And you'll have to be careful it's not too I don't know what .
And we needed to make some but not too much.
And then so I need the soup, I can add it.
And after that, I put the shrimps, nicely
decorate.
And the hot pepper which was baked.
. And then, since I don't have a big oven, I cover it with the aluminum wrap
and maybe steam it for five minutes.
And it's ready.
So
in case of paella, it takes longer time to cut
.
And when this preparation is ready, it takes less about half an hour.
So it's nice cuisine when you invite friends.
.
.
.
Thank you very much. 
 I haven't decided .
.
. No.

, that's O K.
