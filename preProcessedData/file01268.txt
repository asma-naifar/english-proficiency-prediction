<??></??> My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.Yes.I think I'm fine. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><?>It's a</?> bit chilly though.I came from <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. I was at my university. I'm handing in some papers.<F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> my major is Shakespeare. Mainly in <?>former</?> history during eighteenth and nineteenth century Briton.<F>Um</F> I graduated high school in Canada.<OL>And</OL> as a curriculum, I studied Shakespeare.<F>Um</F> especially "King Lear" interested me so <F>um</F> it was at my last <?>thing</?> in high school, so I decided to study English literature in Japansince I was going back to Japan.<OL>And</OL> also <F>er</F> at that point my <F>um</F> strongest point was using English, so it came like a natural <OL>answer</OL>.Yes.<F>Um</F> <laughter>I'm not sure</laughter> because both of them has good points and both of them have the <SC>bad</SC> negative points.<F>Um</F> the good point of Canada is it has a very nice <F>um</F> summer weather.Quite cool. And <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> it has more breathing space than <?>that in Japan</?> because of the width of the country. And the better side of Japan is, of course my mother tongue is Japanese, so I won't have to think that muchusing the language.I'm from <H pn="others2">XXX03</H>.Yes.Yes.<F>Um</F> <SC>I have</SC> <F>uh</F> my mother currently lives with me and so does my brother and my dog. And my father right now lives in <H pn="others3">XXX04</H>because he was transferred to <H pn="others3">XXX04</H> about four years ago.No. Because <laughter>I entered into</laughter> university<F>er</F> I can only visit him <F>er</F> twice a year.During summer and during winter.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Um</F> it's quite hot.Although <R>the</R> <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> the weather in the morning and the evening is quite pleasant because it's surrounded by mountain.But <F>er</F> on daytime it is quite hot. And <F>er</F> since <F>er</F> it is one of the <F>ur</F> countrysides in Japan you need a car to <R>go</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>go</R> <F>oh</F> go around.<F>Um</F> no. I have a <laughter>driver's license</laughter> but I haven't drove a car for about six years <OL>which is quite dangerous</OL>.<laughter>So</laughter> my mother would not <OL>want me to have my hand on cars</OL>.I usually go out with my friend,go window shopping<OL>or</OL> I <SC?>something</SC?> usually read <OL>in my house</OL>.<F>Um</F> it depends but <F>um</F> usually <F>um</F> around Odaiba or<F>ur</F> Shibuya.<F>Um</F> <F>er</F> because of the huge <laughter>shopping malls</laughter>. It's easy to go around because <R>i</R> <F>ur</F> <R>i</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> it has two huge malls. You could go into either one. And then you can spend a dayjust going around <OL>and talking</OL>. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K. <F>Um</F> a lady lives in this room with her dog and cat. The room, it looks quite spacious but somewhat old-fashioned because it has a typewriter. And right beside it has a personal computer. And she seems that she's enjoying herself. And also there is a <.></.> stereo and a phone so it doesn't look like an apartment but it seems that she lives with her family.And also <F>um</F> <SC>the</SC> her pets seems to <F>er</F> enjoying staying in her <laughter>room</laughter>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Er</F> yes.<F>Er</F> he came from one of the breeders at the <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> and he came to our house when I was in junior high school.Quite small.But <F>er</F> after a year, he went to Canada with our family. So he stayed there till he was five.So it seemed that he enjoyed <F>er</F> running around the huge yard. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.Yes.<F>Um</F> he had to be in a quarantine for two weeks and it was in the middle of the summer, quite hot. And we were quite worried about his health.<F>Um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> all of the family would have <F>er</F> something to talk about. And whenever we felt <.></.> like depressed, we could just look at the dog and it would probably go <laughter>away</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>So<F>hm</F> that's the advantage. <SC>Especially <F>um</F> <F>er</F> when</SC> especially in my family, my father lives quite far away and he <SC>seldoms come back</SC> seldom comes back. And me and my brother is both university students so we don't stay around in our house quite a long. Soit's very hard to find a common topic to talk about.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<laughter>O K</laughter>.O K.Yes. <F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> I bought this reservation ticket for the train but <F>um</F> the subway that I took to came here was delayed by an accidentand therefore, I was not able to catch the reservated train.And could you give me an exchange because <R>the</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> the subway company gave us a slip of paper that explains that <SC>the</SC> my lateness or my delay is not by my own fault?Really. But it's funny because <F>um</F> <SC>your company</SC> train company is <SC>with same</SC> in the same company with the subway.And since the same company gave me the slip of the <F>um</F> what is it, the proof of delay,<SC>isn't it</SC> it's <F>um</F> strange that I cannot get an exchange.<R>Then</R> <F>um</F> <F>hm</F> then is it possible to get a refund?But this is a quite unusual <OL>situation</OL>.Since the accident could have been prevented, especially it was a suicidal <F>well</F> accident.And if <SC>the</SC> how should I say, the staffof the companylooked at the <F>er</F> platform quite <OL>often</OL>,you could have prevented it.Really. <OL>Then</OL>I'll give you a paper and you could phone the company.<OL>O K</OL>.Yes, I will.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.No. <F>Er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>there was only</SC> especially the <SC>live</SC> area I lived in was <H pn="others5">XXX06</H>and there was only one train. And the nearest <F>um</F> strain station was about, what, fifteen-minute <laughter>car drive</laughter>.So I usually took the bus or my <F>hm</F> father took me to my high school.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.Yes.<F>Um</F> it really depends on the <F>um</F> situation because in Canada, <F>er</F> <SC>train was</SC> there was only one train. And compared with that, there was quite a few buses <F>um</F> going around <F>um</F> like Yamanote Line <F>um</F> once every fifteen minutes or once every five minute.But <F>er</F> it's quite cold <laughter>waiting in snow</laughter>.So I think, <F>um</F> going around the train might be a bit comfortable because it would be punctual.<F>Um</F> I had to wait for my bus for about twenty minutes in a minus twenty weather.I don't know who would claimed that <OL>of a very</OL> nice <laughter>experience</laughter>.I just stayed inside. There is a usual small waiting room or waiting box. So I usually stayed inside and just covers myself in my coat.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. <F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>er</F> Mark was driving his car. And then from the other side, <F>er</F> there was a man driving a motorcycle. And also he was phoning with his girlfriend on the cellphone. And when Mark tried to turn left, the <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> driver of the motorcycle <F>er</F> <.></.> 's <F>er</F> cellphone somewhat slipped from his hand and it hit Mark's <F>er</F> mirror. And because of that, his cellphone broke. And at the same time, because Mark was surprised by the <F>er</F> sudden appearance of the man, he hit the <F>um</F> bike. <SC>The man claimed to</SC> <F>um</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> excuse me, the man claimed to have his <F>um</F> bike repaired as <F>well</F> as his cellphone repaired. Therefore they had to call the police. And when police arrived, <SC>Marked</SC> Mark explained the situation and also he explained to the policeman that the man was using his cellphone which was prohibited. <nvs>cough</nvs> And therefore <F>um</F> the policeman <F>er</F> did write the paper but it turns out that he does not have to pay for the man's <F>um</F> bike's repair and so his cellphone's repair. So the man had to wait for the <F>um</F> what is it, <F>er</F> the truck to take his bike to a garage. And since he had no other option, he had to pay for his own repairs.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Um</F> <F>well</F> to some point, yeah, <F>er</F> it is quite expensive. But <F>er</F> because it is expensive, people do try to concentrate and get their driver's licenses as fast as possible.So I think it is, I think, a necessary evil in <SC>something</SC> some case.Because <F>um</F> meaning of <R>a</R> a lower price is sometimes a bad quality,and especially when one is getting a driver's license, it is quite important to understand the danger of <OL>driving</OL>,so I think it is <F>uh</F> necessary to payhuge amount of moneyin some way.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Er</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> the easiest way is <F>ur</F> make a train that does not receive a cellphone.<OL>Like</OL> in concert halls.Some of the concert halls do <F>er</F> <SC>build their <F>um</F> concert halls</SC> weld a ledinside their wall which does not allow any reception of cellphones <OL>so</OL>might be a good ideaif you seriously want tostop the <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> passenger using cellphones.<F>Um</F> I would just watch and see what he does. If he's talking more than five minutes, <F>um</F> I might think about calling the <F>er</F> staff of the train, becauseit is well-known that if someone <F>um</F> says something to the <F>er</F> <SC>s</SC> person using cellphone, they sometimes <?>get</?> quite violent.<OL>So</OL> calling the <F>er</F> staff would be a good thing.But sometimes people do <SC>s</SC> <F>um</F> use cellphone on the train but usually they will tell <?>those</?> the person at the other end that they're on the train and they'll arrive in about ten, fifteen minutes, I'll just go by and be able to sit down.How should I say it? <F>Uh</F> <?>up</?> the phone. So I think it's just fine for about five, ten minutes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mh-hmm</F>.No. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes, I'm going home.<F>Oh</F>.<F>Er</F> it's actually <F>er</F> <H pn="others6">XXX07</H> on the <OL><H pn="others7">XXX08</H></OL>.<OL>So it's about</OL> maximum, an hour.Yes, <OL>I think</OL>.<F>Um</F> walking <nvs>laughter</nvs> would be a quite long <OL>walk</OL>.But I usually take the bus.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><??></??> <?>windy</?></laughter></OL>.
