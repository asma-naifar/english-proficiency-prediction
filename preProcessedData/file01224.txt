were very friendly.
And they are like open.
And yeah, they liked Asian people,

they're used to Asian people more than the   like this side.

And  the  old days' quality is good.
.
Yeah. .
.
. You can't find the same shape  among new  clothes  and  yeah,  most of them I like the shape  the print.
 it depends. But if I like so much,   I won't worry about money  but that's because I don't buy so often.

" this is cheap. I'll get it,
.". I don't do like that.

I'll think so    long time like one  week and go there again.
And if I see it and I still love it, I will get it.
