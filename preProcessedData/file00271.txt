I'm fine, thank you. . How ?
. . It's  very cold. 
No, I prefer summer to winter.
I don't like a cold weather. .
  I sometimes cannot sleep. It's too cold.
.
In summer.     nothing in special. 
But  I don't like  hot weather too, but    it's a little better than cold.    hot weather is a bit better than cold weather for me.
 not so busy these days.  I was busy last year, but my   working volume  is reducing, so    I'm not so busy these days.
 . By the rearrangement of the    working roles .
 Yes, very good for me.

After work.  I have a daughter, so   when I come home,   I have to  take care of my daughter.  for example, she has to do homework, so  I    look for her.
Yeah.

Yes.   my daughter's name is . She is seven years old. She goes to a primary school.
 she's a first grade now.      every morning, she cannot wake up early, so  my first job  in a day is     waking her up.

 repeatedly ask to   wake up. 


Yes.
Shall I ?

 O K. It's a sunny day. A girl is  jumping a rope in front of her house. Her house has two stairs. . The living room has a large window.  Her house doesn't  have fence, so  dogs can easily enter their  garden.  .   the boys are playing a ball next to the girl's house.  On their back, there are some trees. In winter,   it will turn yellow, so probably it's summer now.   a man is running on the  sidewalk.      in front of a girl's house, there are two women  are chatting.  One of them is   taking a dog.  probably she is      on a way home. A car is parking.  On the bonnet, a cat is sleeping.  .  if the dog  found the cat,  its would   chase her.
 chase her.  but the dog didn't finds a cat yet.
.
.
. I envy a big house, 
 I want to live in a big house.
Of course,   if I can live  close to the office, it's very good but  if I have to choice two points,  I'll choose a big house.
Yes, please.
.
Yes. I would like to go abroad this spring holidays, but  I have no plan yet.
 would you recommend some places?
. Europe.  how long do we need for that trip?
Ten days.     I would go on a trip with my daughter. She is still seven years.
Do you think Europe is  good for her?
.
   how do you think it's good for child?
.
.  and  I've never been to Europe in winter, but it was very cold. And daytime  was very short.     night comes early than Japan, but how about spring? .
.
I see.
No problem?  I've never been to Italy,   and I would like to go but I hesitate to go there because  I'm with my child.
Yes. But   how long does it fly from Tokyo to Italy?
. It's heavy for me. 
Yeah.
 is that a direct flight?
And          do you show me the Italy's plan?  some Italy's plan?
.
.
.
I see. . Can I ask  over the phone?
 thank you.
.
Thank you.
Yes.  I like traveling, so I go with my daughter.
.
. .      my daughter  is not boring.
And next, I can be relaxed,    I prefer resort places   a city.
.
Last week.
. O K. One day last week I went to  see a movie with my friends.    I haven't seen movies for a long time, so   I have been really looking forward that.  And    I didn't receive any information of that movie.  my friends    chose the good movie,  they said. .
And  in the movie theater, we bought popcorns and coke. I like popcorns very much. . Every time I go to  a movie theater, I buy popcorn.    I think popcorn and coke is a best combination.  .     before the movie starting,  we enter the    movie room.       we were seated in the back of the  room.   .            it was a  action movie.
. I don't like  an action movie, so I haven't been to see  an action movie, but it was rather  interesting to me, so I thought that was a good chance for me to see  various kinds of movie.  .   after the movie was over,  we were so excited. So we wanted to talk about the movie more, so  we  planned to go out  to drink  and talk about the movie  over beer.
.
  I'll have a MOUS test on Saturday.
MOUS stands for Microsoft  User's Specialist.
. Yes.
 Yeah. Tough for me.
Thank you very much.
