. , .
Yeah, sure, .
I live in ,  Prefecture.
. . The other side of  area. . You know,  or  .  is famous for city of .  .  Line or  Line.
 Actually, I live in a tall building,  twenty-one floors, and I live in a sixteenth floor. So, every morning, I can see the rising sun  from the horizontal.  And,  in my neighbor,    everything is  ready, for instance, bank or big shopping arcade, post office, medical center. . About  twenty thousand  people are living there.
Yeah. But, actually,  I have only one wife. .
  we've been married about   thirteen years. But  god doesn't  give our babies.
 She is a sport woman.  She is good at playing golf. Actually, she . Sometimes, I beaten.  . And,  yeah, she was an athlete in her high school days. And  she is very bright, and I love her character well. And   she is good at cooking, too.
. Ski, competition ski, you know? Alpine skiing. And,   these days, mountain bike. . Recently, this summer, I went to Sendai from my city about three hundred fifty kilometers from my house with mountain bike.
. 
Long journey. I took  four days from my house to Sendai. But, anyway, I had a lot of fun.
Attraction?
You mean,   what do I  ?
I think,  scenery. For instance,   along the  Pacific Ocean line,  I pointed to the north, and I  just pedaling my mountain bike  from morning to evening about   twelve hours a day. But scenery was very very beautiful. And,  yeah, this summer, it was very hot.
But,  last two days, I got  rain and shower. And  very cool. So comfortable to ride on a bike.

O K. This is about  winter. I love winter so much. And,  as I told you, I skied in my collegiate days. . About this picture,  there are some people, and they are enjoying skiing. And, for instance, there is a, maybe, ski instructor, and some students for ski class. And   he dropped down on    new snow.  we can see the some snowboarder. And  they are enjoying   snow ball matching, I'm not sure how to say in English, but  snow ball matching, maybe. . And,  in the cottage or   mountain cottage,   one couple are enjyoing talking over a cup of coffee. .
Hardest thing? . Don't do any mistake. How can we  diminish  our small mistakes, for instance,  perfect. . Anyway,      this is to   any kind of sports,  don't do any mistakes is very important.
 That's    .
Perfect. For instance,      in skiing in  one turn,  sometimes  the condition of   snow is  slightly different from some point. So   I can feel touching with the snow from the  ski. And  push the power  on the ski.  sometimes,  so I drop down on the ski.  and  we have to fix the ski, for instance, edge of the ski.
Sure.
 .
 . Sure.
 Yesterday, I came here, and   I like this shoes so much. But this shoes is not so good. For instance,         the bottom of the  shoes was not good. So I want to change this shoes, please.
 at that time. But I didn't notice that.
Yeah, , no, no, no,   this shoes was insured by the company, but I believed that but this is not good. Please exchange, please.
I don't want this.
Can I change or not?
No. Not yet.
Yes, of course.
So, please call your  owner of this shop.
Telephone number?   are there any owner here?
 my gosh. So,  please check him phone number. I'd like to phone again later.
. Please.
 In this situation?
?  .  For instance, a lot. I bought a new computer in these days, but  computer, you know, a lot of trouble, so I have to fix sometimes. So   it depends on the software, or  sometimes it depends on the hardware. It's up to the computer. So I have to ask some shops or company. So   it take a long time to fix the computer.
Yeah.
.
O K. .  My name is   , and her name is . O K? . We are nice couple, and  we are waiting for the marriage day.  One day last week,  we are going to shopping.  And,    on that day, it was raining.  During   we are enjoying talking,     I heard the cats crying. And I found the box.  And   no, no,   took up the baby cat. . She like the kitten,   and she seems to keep the kitten. But I said, "No. In our apartment house, it's prohibited to keep the cats.". But    me and  "Please , please.". So I have to say, "It's O K.". That's all.
. Except my wife? 
. Yeah.   some cats. I prefer cats to dogs.
Why? .  Pretty.
In my collegiate days, I live in an apartment. And,  of course, it was prohibited to keep the cats. and      I cannot stop keeping the cats 'cause they are newborn babies. And I kept six kittens in my room.  .  In the morning, very early time, for instance,  four or five o'clock,  the baby cats woke up.  And,  you know,     I was a college student. So     I slept  midnight. So, early morning, it's  very hard to wake up. But, every morning, they disturb my sleeping. And,  one day,  some cats pissed         I can't say,  on my . So it's terrible.
.  I scold them. And, later on,  I prepared the sand box for them.
About  one year. One year after,  some day, all of them   went somewhere.
Very sorry. But,  yeah,  to keep cats sometimes cause  troubles. So it's O K.
.
.
.
. Yeah.
Maybe.
I hope. 
. . 
It's the world famous and  best thing to eat.
.
.
Real.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
