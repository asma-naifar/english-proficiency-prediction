One day last week,  I was driving  to the station. And from the other opposite      the bike was  running. The driver was  telephoning  with his girlfriend. And he drove with his one hand on the bike. And  I try to drive to the left, but at that time     I had an accident with that  bike's man.    and the driver's telephone was broken by that accident. And the  bike's driver  told me to compensate for the loss of   telephone. But   I explained to the policeman that   the bike's driver  was very careless. Because   he was telephoning  during his driving.   the policeman  judged    that I was right. And the fault was on   bike side. And the bike was  taken away by the police. Yeah.
