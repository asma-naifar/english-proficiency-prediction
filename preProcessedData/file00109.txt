Town? it's a newly developed town, and it was developed by the Tokyo Metropolitan. And I lived in there around the three years ago when I came back from the United States.
And it's a very much suburb area.
Not so convenient. it's a little bit far away from the station. So we are now using a car by commute.
 the reason is yeah, the environment was good. the air is freshened. we wanted to live in a very good circumstance area.
 and my wife likes garden very much. So it's a not the apartment, but house. So my wife is very glad to live in that area.
But for me,
not so convenient. 
 yes, usually I go to the shopping with my wife, and I go to the gymnasium to take a exercise.
 yeah, and now my last daughter is expecting to take a exercise next year. So I'm teaching her.
 Yes.

 it was a very tough, cheap, but we went by the big car, and we went various places, and we stayed a very cheap motel
. 
Yeah.
. .
 yeah. it's a good place to live. And yeah, many children are playing in the garden. yeah, but it's a not Japanese circumstance. I think it's U S or European styled living place. And yeah, what I say . So when I was in America, I lived in this kind of houses. And in that area, there was no fence between the house. So yeah, it was a very good circumstance yeah, in America when I lived.

I cannot attend. O K.

Hello. Hello Miss, I'm sorry,
 Miss Mimura. yes.
I'm sorry I couldn't attend the party yesterday.
 that was because sudden had a very serious situation about my job. So I couldn't attend the party. But yeah, actually my boss in the Malaysia asked me to explain about the current serious company situation. And also we will have a restructuring situation in the near future. So I discussed about it. and it took a long time. So I couldn't attend the meeting. That is a yeah, I apology to you very much. But next time, when I have a chance to go to your house, I want go to your house. And I want to see your family members.
Yes.
Yeah.
. . But yeah, yeah, that is true, and I really apologize to you about it.

 I didn't forget the party, but yeah, I worked till late at night. So I thought that it's not the appropriate time to call to you. .
 yeah. But it was late. after eleven o'clock, I finished my work. So yeah, I couldn't call you at that time.

O K. Yes.
.
. Yeah.
.
Yes. I had many chance because my kids were my kids went to the school, and the school was a very familiar school. And we were invited by the various people.
.
 yeah. we went to the thanks giving party, and yeah, actually the most interesting one was I forgot the name, it's pumpkins. it the end of August. It was Halloween party. Yeah. that was very fun. And yeah at the ti Halloween time, many kids go around the various houses. And at that time, we have to distribute the candies to each children. Yeah. That was a very good experience for us.
.
.
Yeah.
.
O K.

O K.
Yeah I explained about the total stories?
O K.
. . yeah. one day last week, I drove a car. And someone came from the opposite side by riding a bicycle, not bicycle, it's a motorbike. And unfortunately, I crashed to the motorcycle at the corner. And the yeah, motorcycle was broken, and the rider claimed to me about the accident. That he insisted that I am wrong. but yeah, it was a corner's accident. So I thought that the mistake ratio is fifty and fifty. I don't know the exact word, but yeah. So I called the policeman, and I explained about the situation to the policeman. And finally, anyway the motorbike is broken. So it was carried by the truck to repair.
.
. . yeah. I've never experience this kind of examination. So yeah, I couldn't imagine how I will explain it.
Yeah.
 I've never experienced this kind of accident.
.
Yes, I drive a car everyday.
, by commute I drive a car.
 yeah. I had a ticket of speed over. But have any accident I didn't have any accident in the past.
.
Right procedure?

. I think yeah, at first, we will invite a policeman, and explain about the situation. And when we want to cover the damage by the insurance, we need a some kind of certificate from the policeman. And to submit to the insurance company. I think that is . 
Yeah. I'm sure the exact one. But I think if I will have an accident, I will do like this.
Yeah.
If someone will be hurted by the accident, then the first priority is call call to the to hospital or not hospital, it's a ambulance office. And yeah, to save the life is most priority.
.
O K. .
Yeah. .
I think so.
.
Yes, my house is a very rural area. So yeah, very the car is a very important one, necessary to move around.
. It's a very important method to move from my house to everywhere.
My wife's driving skill is the fairly well.
.
. .
Thank you very much.
