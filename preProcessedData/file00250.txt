My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes. <OL>Of course</OL>.I'm very fine. <OL>Thank you</OL>.<F>Erm</F> I work on <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> temporary basis. I work as a <F>er</F> coordinator for overseas participants. And <F>er</F> my job just finished last week. So, I have free time today.I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Oh</F> <F>erm</F> it's on the <F>ur</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> line. It's about ten minutes away from the station. <R>I live</R> I live in an <R>a</R> apartment.<F>Er</F> no. I live alone.<F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> first of all, <F>erm</F> the best thing <F>er</F> to live alone is that nobody <F>er</F> criticize me even if <R>I</R> I don't clean up <nvs>laughter</nvs> completely. And also, on weekends, <R>I can</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> I can be in the bed as long as I want. I think that's the best thing <.></.> living alone.I like traveling very much. And I usually <F>er</F> prefer <F>er</F> traveling alone <SC>and with</SC> <F>er</F> as a backpacker. It's a <??></??> cheap traveling, but <F>er</F> in that way, I can have <F>er</F> more chances to talk with local people.<F>Ah</F> yes. <F>Er</F> very much.<F>Er</F> for instance, <F>erm</F> when I went to <F>er</F> Spain a few years ago, <F>erm</F> I didn't know that the local people <F>er</F> don't speak English a lot. And I don't speak Spanish a lot. Only <R>I</R> I learned a few sentences before I left here. So, <F>erm</F> <F>err</F> very often, I had <F>er</F> difficulty <F>er</F> with communicating the local people, especially when I have to <F>erm</F> take transportation. <F>Urm</F>. <.></.> <F>Er</F> international airport is O K, but if I go to the local <F>er</F> bus terminal station <F>erm</F> not many people understand English. So, it took me more time to get a ticket and to go to <F>er</F> right <F>er</F> platform. So, every time <SC>I <.></.> have to move</SC> I had to move, it took more time.<F>Oh</F> not at all. <F>Erm</F> I think Spanish food is very <F>er</F> <.></.> suitable to Japanese people. I found it very similar to <F>er</F> Japanese food, because they eat a lot of <F>er</F> seafood. And <.></.> Spanish food is also very popular here, so I was very familiar with that.<.></.> <F>Oh</F> I should describe this? O K. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> it's a sunny day. And <.></.> <F>er</F> people in this town are having very happy time. <F>Erm</F> there's one house on the street. And <.></.> <F>erm</F> <R>a car is</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> a car is parking in front of the <F>er</F> big house. And there are two women <F>er</F> chatting each other. One of them <F>er</F> <.></.> <R>w</R> walks a dog. And a man wearing <SC>s</SC> <F>er</F> wet suit is jogging in front of the house. And there are two dogs facing each other on the lawn just in front of the house, and they seem to be owned by the owner of this house. <F>Er</F> a small girl is playing <F>eh</F> in front of the big window <.></.> <F>er</F> who seems to <.></.> be a daughter of this <F>er</F> family. And there are two other boys playing with a ball, <F>er</F> seemingly playing <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> volleyball. <F>Er</F> they seems to be elementary school students. Across the street, <F>er</F> there is a <.></.> <F>er</F> big white house. In front of the house, a middle-aged man <F>er</F> wearing glasses is reading a paper on the bench.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes, I like it.<OL>In the news</OL> paper? <F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <SC>these days</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> I've been watching T V and newspaper intensively these days, but <?>overly</?> <F>eh</F> <F>er</F> I found the <SC>same <.></.> news</SC> same kind of news. <F>Er</F> one is related to the <F>er</F> sunken <F>er</F> submarine off the Hawaii, and <F>er</F> another one is related to <F>er</F> <F>er</F> Prime Minister <F>er</F> who is involved in <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> K S D <F>er</F> issue and some other <R>tra</R> tragic issues and I can not find very <F>erm</F> favorable news <F>er</F> especially these days. <.></.>O K.O K.Yes. <F>Erm</F> I missed my train. And <F>er</F> I had a reservation <R>se</R> seat <F>er</F> in the train. So, <F>er</F> I'd like you to refund <F>er</F> my ticket.<F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> yesterday, <SC>it was <F>er</F> heavy snow</SC> there was heavy snow in Tokyo. So, <F>er</F> the subway I had to take <F>er</F> was greatly delayed and <F>er</F> although <R>I</R> <F>eh</F> <.></.> I went to the station at the right time, but <SC>the train</SC> the subway train <R>didn't</R> <F>er</F> didn't start <F>er</F> for half an hour. So, <F>erm</F> <.></.> that made me <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> delay. <F>Ur</F> <.></.> that's why <R>I</R> I couldn't <F>er</F> <F>er</F> get to station <F>er</F> at the right time. This is how <R>I</R> I missed the train.<OL><F>Well</F></OL> <OL><F>erm</F></OL>.Yes. <F>Er</F> yesterday, <F>er</F> <R>there wer</R> <F>er</F> there were a lot of information about the transportation. But <F>er</F> this morning, it was a very sunny day. So, <F>erm</F> <R>I</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I didn't <F>er</F> listen to the T V or in radio. <F>Er</F> because around my house <F>er</F> which is located in central Tokyo, there's no snow anymore. So, <F>erm</F> I thought <F>er</F> <SC>I ha</SC> I would have no troubles <F>er</F> <.></.> taking the subway.<OL><R>Thank you very</R></OL>thank you very much.<OL><F>Well</F></OL>.<F>Erm</F> <SC>not</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>no, did</SC> I didn't <F>er</F> miss any train so far, but <SC>I was</SC> <F>er</F> I almost miss my plane because of the heavy snow. So, <SC>this situation is very</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> it reminds me of <F>ur</F> the situation I had before.<F>Well</F> I was very <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> nervous <SC>and</SC> <.></.> because <SC>it was on the job</SC> I was on a jobs, and <F>er</F> I had to take the plane and <F>er</F> <SC>highway was</SC> <F>ur</F> highways was closed <SC>by the</SC> because of a heavy snow. And the driver of the bus <SC>hadn't</SC> had no choice but to take the ordinary road, but there was no information on the <F>ur</F> <.></.> road besides that road. So, <F>er</F> not only me but <F>ur</F> all members <R>of</R> of my group was all anxious.O K.<F>Er</F> one day last week, <F>erm</F> I and my friend <F>er</F> were preparing for <F>er</F> camping. And we provided <F>er</F> many camping equipment and staffing <SC>the</SC> our car <F>er</F> with those equipment. And we <F>er</F> headed for <F>er</F> mountain <.></.> site. <SC>We are</SC> we set up our <F>ur</F> tent. And we started <F>er</F> cooking <F>er</F> using <F>er</F> <F>urm</F> camping cooker. But soon after that, <F>er</F> the weather became bad and it started raining. <.></.> And we thought that <SC>it is not</SC> <R>it</R> it would stop soon. But on the other hand, it continued to <F>er</F> get worse. And even the wind became very <F>er</F> <R>st</R> <R>st</R> <F>er</F> strong. And <.></.> <R>it</R> <F>erm</F> it blew away almost <SC>everything</SC> <R>every</R> everything of our <F>er</F> camping equipment. And our tent was totally destroyed. <F>Er</F> we abandoned those equipment and rushed into our car. And <F>ur</F> soon after that, <F>erm</F> the thunderstorm <F>er</F> started. <R>We</R> <F>er</F> we had no choice but to find <F>er</F> hotel. <F>Er</F> a few minutes after we drove, we find a nice hotel <F>er</F> named <F>er</F> Hotel Cosmos. <F>Er</F> <.></.> by that time, the weather <R>beca</R> became even worse. But luckily, <R>we could</R> <F>ur</F> we could get a nice room <F>er</F> with a beautiful scenery. Because <R>we</R> we got drenched in the heavy rain, we took a shower and had a <F>er</F> relaxing time having coffee after that.<F>Oh</F> yes. I like it very much <OL>actually</OL>.<F>Oh</F>.O K. <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F>. Tent is usually <F>er</F> comes with <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> iron <.></.> structure. And first, we put those <F>er</F> sticks into <F>er</F> <SC>tent</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> four sides of tent which makes the structure of the tent. And then, <SC>there are <SC>main <.></.> <F>er</F> poles</SC> main</SC> there are usually <F>er</F> <.></.> two main poles. And first, we <F>eh</F> <.></.> stand them on the ground. And then <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> pull the tent <F>oh</F> <.></.> into four directions. And <.></.> also <F>oh</F> you need pegs <F>er</F> which is like <F>er</F> nails. And you need <F>er</F> peg and a hammer. So, <F>er</F> <R>you have to</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> you have to <F>er</F> press <F>er</F> four sides of the tent with pegs using hammer. And <SC>it makes the</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> <SC>it ma</SC> <F>urm</F> it supports the tent from all directions. <.></.> Yes. That's it.<F>Er</F> this weekend. <F>Er</F> I usually go to school on <R>S</R> Saturday. I go to interpretation school to brush up my interpretation skills.
