<H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes, sure.Fine, thank you, and you?<F>Mm</F>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <F>Er</F>. Nearby <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, you know, <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.Yeah. Nearby <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.Fireworks in the summer time. <nvs>laughter</nvs>That's a <F>eh</F> entertainment <R>for</R> for kids. <SC>Tr</SC> Playground, like Disneyland, all times now. Disneyland is taking over.Yeah. So it's not so popular now.Because <F>eh</F> everybody is going to Disneyland rather than old <F>er</F> facility at <F>eh</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.Yes, of course. <SC>When</SC> Many, many years ago, when my boys were still <F>eh</F> small.Two boys. Yes.Yeah. They are already grown-up. They are taken up a job. <F>Er</F>. One is a security's companies. The other is a real estate. And they are both <F>er</F> <SC>summer</SC> somehow engineers. Not, <F>er</F> you know, like <R>my</R> myself was background is law school, but they are graduate from mathematics, and the other is <F>er</F> electrical engineer.<F>Well</F>. I think basic skill is communication including English if they are working for <F>er</F> <R>multi-na</R> <SC>multi-national</SC> multi-cultural companies. <R>And</R> <F>er</F> and <F>er</F> knowledge of their own field and also some problem solving, <F>er</F> how they have to solves some problem which are encounter <R>their</R> <R>their</R> their situation. So their basic skills and then if they are grown up to <F>er</F> <F>er</F> higher position, they naturally need managerial skills.So they are two layers of skills. One is basic skills, communication, problem solving, and <F>er</F> conflict interest <F>er</F> in many things, <F>eh</F> team work. And then, second level is so-called leadership or managerial skill, yes.Many Japanese companies, they are working for Japanese companies, providing training for newcomers. Orientation, <F>er</F> two years later, and five years later, and they gradually <F>er</F> take over many jobs and <F>eh</F> different jobs, and learn on the job training as well as a seminars and school-type of training.<F>Well</F>. <SC>Traditionally, they are</SC> <SC>but</SC> <F>er</F> yes, it was <F>er</F> traditionally company was responsible to grow people, but, nowadays, <F>eh</F> the trend is a little bit changing. <F>Er</F>. Individual is also responsible for his or her own <F>er</F> <F>er</F> growth or training. Yes, yes.<OL>Yes</OL>. Sure, sure.<F>Oh</F>. Yes. I have a hobby of scuba diving. <F>Huh</F>. I got a license ten years ago in Hawaii. And, once every year, I tried to go to Hawaii, or, sometimes I went down to Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It was fantastic view.Scuba diving is very <F>er</F> a kind of different world. <F>Er</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Underwater as you know. So it's fascinating world, indeed.I love it.I recommend you. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Sure.Yes, of course. You have to get the license to be eligible go down <F>er</F> with, you know, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> facilities. <SC>So it could be</SC> <?>I mean</?>, and then, <F>em</F> <F>er</F> it's not dangerous if you go through proper process. So you need some <F>er</F> knowledge and <F>er</F> skill of of, say, <F>er</F> maneuverings equipment and <F>er</F> how to breathe and everything. So it takes <F>er</F> minimum three days go through that process. And you got the license, and you are less dangerous <nvs>laughter</nvs> than otherwise. Yes.Yeah. Sure.<OL>yes</OL>.Yes. <F>Eh</F>. This is <F>er</F> a picture of classroom <F>er</F> for, <F>er</F> say, <F>er</F> junior high school or even <F>er</F> primary school. Maybe, <R>older</R> older, because of the blackboard says something <F>er</F> higher level of, <F>er</F> I believe, mathematics. And the teacher is female, and <R>I</R> I was wondering whether that affects some of the psychology of the students. <F>Er</F>. Some of them <F>er</F> <F>er</F> bubbling <F>er</F> <F>er</F> chewing the <SC>bug</SC> <F>er</F> gum, drinking water and <F>er</F> chatting. And it's a typical scene of a Japanese <F>er</F> school at this moment. <F>Er</F>. Because we <F>er</F> <F>er</F> hear a lot of these things in newspapers and <R>from the</R> from the parents. So <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I'm not so <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> happy to see this kind of picture in Japan, because when I was young, I was <F>er</F> so much <F>er</F> say instructed to study hard at school, and not chat or even drink and so forth. But <F>er</F> that might be affected by American style of life, <nvs>laughter</nvs> and <F>er</F> it's good and bad because <F>er</F> in terms of <F>er</F> individuality, <F>er</F> individual in the United States <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> very much <F>er</F> appreciated, so even in the classroom, this kind of things may be allowed. But, <F>er</F> on the other hand, in Japan, it's a too much strict. So <SC>something</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>some</SC> <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <SC>everything</SC> <F>er</F> sometimes it is said that Japanese mother sometimes <F>er</F> <F>er</F> not stop <SC>crea</SC> creativity, so that is a kind of balance of discussion should be taken. But this picture <F>er</F> reminds me <F>oh</F> this is a typical scene <F>er</F> in Japanese school classes now.<F>Ah</F>. <SC>I don't like</SC> <F>er</F> myself, I prefer <R>more</R> more, say, <F>er</F> trained or <F>er</F> more polite way <R>to</R> <SC>to <R>let</R> let me</SC> <R>to</R> to the <F>er</F> teachers. It's not good <F>er</F> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to ignore <F>er</F> what the teacher is saying. So I understand this situation in Japan, but what I said is <F>er</F> <F>er</F> it's not good <R>for</R> for the students <SC>to grow up</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> in the stage of growing up.Yeah. Important thing is <F>er</F> <F>im</F> <F>mm</F> make the classroom discussion <F>er</F> attractive, interesting to them. <nvs>laughter</nvs> That is the first thing <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to attract the students. Sometimes the, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> you know, <SC>the teaching</SC> <F>er</F> the content of the teaching is <F>er</F> boring. So they started to talk about, they thinking other things and what <F>er</F> the teachers say the same. <CO>So</CO>. <F>Uhm</F>.Yes, sure. Yes. <R>That is</R> <F>er</F> that is very challenging for me, but, <F>er</F> because I'm not a teacher but <F>er</F> I'm in charge of H R and training <F>er</F> I tried to make <F>er</F> the topic attractive and think about what the students <.></.> want to do. <F>Mm</F>. The first thing is <F>er</F> put your shoes <SC>in your</SC> in their shoes. That is the first thing to think, then the program should be <F>er</F> organized to accommodate what <R>the</R> <R>the</R> <SC>there</SC> is the interest of the students or in our case employees. But, <F>er</F> again, it's a kind of homework for the teacher to know what the real needs of <R>the</R> their audience, their customer, in this case a student, then make the program attractive. That is what Americans teachers are doing <R>in</R> in America. That's I understand.Yes, yes. <SC>They are <R>very</R> very</SC> they prepare everything to attract students. But still <R>I</R> I have not attended American school, but, <F>er</F> maybe, it's a kind of difference of <F>er</F> opinion. On the student side, they want to do something else even if they express their interest and prepared something. It's a kind of gap of perception exist, yeah.<OL><F>Oh</F> yeah</OL>. They have to learn a lot, yeah.Sure.<OL><F>Mhm</F></OL> <OL><F>mhm</F></OL> <F>mhm</F>.Yeah. <CO><R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's <F>er</F> something</CO>. <F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F>. <.></.> Yes.Hello. <F>Er</F>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.<F>Oh</F>. I'm terribly sorry. <R>I</R> I cannot make it. I had a trouble with my stomach. So I was very happy and received your invitation to dinner party tonight, but <F>er</F> I was expecting, but <F>er</F> <R>my</R> my health condition really <F>er</F> hinders me from attending. So, <R>could you</R> could you allow me <R>to</R> <SC>to be skip</SC> <F>er</F> to skip <SC>this mor</SC> <F>em</F> this time? <F>Er</F>. Next time, I really want <R>to</R> to join your party.Could you <F>er</F> <F>er</F> relay my best regards to all <R>your</R> your friends?Yeah?<F>Oh</F> yes?<F>Oh</F>. That's a great idea.Yeah. I love to, but <F>er</F> I just wonder whether I can reach your home <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>in the</SC> <F>er</F> in this condition. So, <F>er</F> next time, please <F>er</F> let me know <laughter>his name, and I</laughter> can call <F>er</F> the doctor which you recommend. <F>Mm</F>.<F>Oh</F>. Great. That's a good<F>Oh</F> really? <R>That's <F>er</F></R> that's <F>er</F> very nice of you. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Er</F>. <R>I</R> I think <F>er</F> it's only <F>er</F> five minutes after the party started. So, <F>er</F> could you <F>er</F> give me <F>er</F> ten, fifteen minutes more? And I call you up again, when I can feel <SC>enough good</SC> <OL>good enough to</OL> <F>er</F> ask your brother to pick me up. Could you?<??></??>.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Thank you very much for your kind <F>er</F> offer, and I really <F>er</F> want to call again <F>er</F> ten minutes, fifteen minutes. Then <F>er</F> I'll talk you later.Thank you very much again.Thank you. Bye.No. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. Really, I have a business <F>er</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> problem, when I was <F>er</F> invited to Netherland headquarters. And, <SC>last</SC> <SC>this</SC> just this <F>er</F> December, <SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> corporate <F>er</F> conference was held, and I had a really <??></??> by problem back. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I couldn't take a flight, so I cancelled that <F>er</F> business trip <?>there</?>. It happens sometimes.Yeah.Yeah. <R>Like</R> like the famous book <F>er</F> <F>er</F> Ishihara-san wrote, Japanese cannot say "No.". So the point is, again, <R>kind</R> kind of difference of cultural background. <F>Er</F>. <SC>Japanese <F>er</F> <F>ey</F> <F>ah</F> on a senior people</SC> so it's not good to oppose the opinion of senior, if it's even different or if he cannot buy the opinion. So, sometime he wants to say "No.", but, still "Yes.". That is a kind of psychological <F>er</F> background Japanese has, <F>er</F> being <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> custom. That's why <F>er</F> Japanese cannot say "No.", <F>er</F> when it's necessary, yes, yeah.<F>Mhm</F>.<F>Eh</F>. This way? <F>Mhm</F>."One day last week"?<F>Ah</F>. Yes. <F>Uhh</F>.<F>Oh</F>. Yes. <F>Well</F>. Last week, <F>er</F> I was driving <F>er</F> motorcycle. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Er</F>. Who I am? You know. O K?Yeah, yeah, yeah. <SC>I</SC> <??></??> <F>em</F> <F>em</F> <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> I had chance to <F>er</F> talk to my <F>er</F> friend by <F>er</F> mobile phone while <SC>I driving</SC> I'm driving <SC>and</SC> <F>er</F> the motorcycle. But, <F>em</F> fortunately, <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> I was so much <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> talking to <F>er</F> <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to my friend <F>er</F> I could not see <F>er</F> the car is coming to my direction, and then there was an accident. And <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the mobile phone was broken. I was so much <F>er</F> <F>er</F> angry to the driver, and, now, the police came and <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the driver is <F>er</F> protesting <R>the</R> <R>the</R> the driver that I was using the mobile phone that's <SC>why</SC> the reason why I <F>er</F> hit the car. <F>Er</F>. Eventually, <SC>the</SC> my <R>mo</R> motor cycle was taken away <F>er</F> <R>by</R> by the another car. <F>Er</F>. And I was left alone without <F>er</F> the vehicle. It was a very sad story just because I started use mobile phone while driving. So, next time, I think I have to stop that <R>bad</R> <F>er</F> bad habit.<OL><R>I was</R> <R>I was</R></OL> <OL>yeah, <R>I was</R> I was</OL>, <F>ah</F> yes, <F>er</F> ninety percent <F>er</F> responsible. <F>Er</F> <F>er</F>. So he <R>should</R> <F>er</F> should learn the lesson by this accident, yes. That is <R>my</R> <R>my</R> my <F>er</F> role in that case, yes. Yes, I think.<F>Oh</F>. Yes. Myself, I drive a car, and, <SC>sometimes</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a couple of times, <F>er</F> <R>over</R> over speed. And, <F>er</F> another time, <SC>hits</SC> <F>er</F> while I was <F>er</F> parking <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> hit another car very <?>sligh</?> slim, but still damaged. So it's a very embarrassing and <F>er</F> taking time and <F>er</F> costly. So <F>er</F> <R>my</R> my lesson is <F>er</F> drive safely, yeah.Yes.<OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. Yes, of course. <R>The</R> the <SC>procedure is</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> standard procedure is <F>er</F> take <?>off</?> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> your driver's license and car license. And <F>er</F> registration, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> document of <SC>the</SC> a car ready to talk to the other <.></.> driver. <OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>. And <F>er</F> you also ask him his <R>dri</R> driver license number and <F>er</F> car number and so forth. Then, the second the stage is call the police, and then, explain the situation what happened then the third is <F>er</F> to ensure <F>er</F> <R>the</R> the other party has a insurance policy to cover the damage <F>er</F> whichever <F>er</F> that happened. Then, the last stage is call your <F>er</F> agent of the insurance company and ask them to take care. So the minimize cost and time <F>er</F> lost by the accident. That is a <OL>typcial standard</OL>.<F>Oh</F>. I think so.But the one thing is, don't say "I'm sorry.". <nvs>laughter</nvs> because that may hint that you are responsible for the accident. <OL>That is</OL> what I learned in the United States.<laughter>Because</laughter> <R>they</R> they had come, <R>many</R> <SC>many</SC> you know, many <F>er</F> sixty times <F>er</F> the number of lawyers American has. So <SC>that</SC> the kind of country <R>be</R> be careful <OL>not be responsible for</OL> <??></??>.Yeah, sure. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Welcome, thank you very much</OL>.O K. Sure. Thank you very much.<F>Er</F>. I'm going down to <R>Ito</R> Itoh.Yeah.<CO>Hot spring to</CO>.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Just one, two days. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Thank you very much.Thank you very much.
