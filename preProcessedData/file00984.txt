O K.
Right. . One day last week, a guy,  I think his name is Tom, is driving a car. The other side  the guy,  his name is  Peter, is driving a motorcycle with  phoning to his girlfriend. Tom and Peter came across on the street. And accidentally, they hit each other. And   Peter's mobile phone was dropped from his hand. And unfortunately, it was broken. . Peter claimed  his mobile phone and his motorcycle  was broken by Tom's car. And  they quarrel on the street. But a police came. And then, listened what they are  talking.
And  Tom claimed the reason they hit each other was because of the Peter's   mobile phone. He was using a mobile phone during his driving. And then, it was very careless.  Then  finally,  the motorcycle  was taken to the shop for the fix. And then,  he had to see her girlfriend on foot.
.
.
.
Yeah. I drive a car.
Yeah.
. Fortunately, nothing.
. I'm a good driver. 
.
Right. First of all, I ask the guy involved the accident were O K or not.
. Yeah.  is
the first priority. And then, ring up the police.
And  report what happened.
And then, I think probably I'll call up the my insurance company.
And then sort out the money or the those kind of stuffs
Yeah.
.
. Since I move to Tokyo, I haven't .
Because    I sold my car.
Yeah. But before that, I used a car by commute.
Yeah.
. Horrible. 
I think it's crazy. 
.  first of all, the  width of road is different.
Yeah. And  the number of pedestrians and the bicycles are very different from .
Obviously, the  has less than .
So I think that driving in  would be much easier.
Yeah.
.
.
.
