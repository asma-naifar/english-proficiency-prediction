But   I myself  cannot have a dog in my house  because    regulation of apartment doesn't allow us to have a dog inside house.   and  my friend is  same situation, so  sometimes we want to see  a dog  to the park  because    many people come to park with dog    to make their dog or cats play   inside the park. So  there is a   Park  very near by  Station. It's a very large park. So people can  play with  dog or cat. Of course children can play inside the park. So  it's a very good place.
So sometime I went to park to see the . But  recently,  it's a very hot so I cannot go to park because      too hot.
