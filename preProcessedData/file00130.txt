I live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> City for twenty-five years.Yeah.Town? <OL><F>Urr</F></OL>.<F>Urr</F> recently, we move the town from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. <F>Urr</F> <F>uhm</F> at first time, I live in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, and recently I move to <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. <F>Urr</F> city is the same, but <F>er</F> I bought <F>urr</F> apartment recently, or it's <F>ah</F> almost one year before. So I moved to new house. But still I <nvs>cough</nvs> live in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> City. <.></.> <F>Uhm</F>.<F>Err</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>at</SC> <F>err</F> two years ago, <R>I</R> I wanted to <F>uhm</F> find out a new house <F>urr</F> because <F>urr</F> <F>mm</F> at that time, I lived in <SC>my father's house</SC> my parents' house. So <nvs>cough</nvs> I want to have a my <R>own</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> own house. So I started to <R>find</R> <F>urr</F> find out some new apartment or <.></.> like <F>urr</F> <JP>mezon</JP> or something. So <.></.> in a finally, I find out a good house in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. So <SC>I</SC> <.></.> and <F>ah</F> <R>one year</R> <F>err</F> one year ago, <F>uhm</F> interests was cheaper than now, and <F>ur</F> analyst said <F>er</F> current <F>err</F> interests is lowest. So I decided to buy. And <F>er</F> borrowed the money from the bank, <R>and</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> and finally got a <SC>new <JP>mezon</JP></SC> <??></??> <F>urr</F> new apartment.Weekend? <R>Recently</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> recently, I didn't go out from my house because <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>urr</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> temperature is very high, <F>urr</F> and <SC>the humidity is</SC> very humidity.
