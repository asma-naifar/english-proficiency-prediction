     it's very comfortable area and  there is many  residence and park. And  it's very useful to go  Shinjuku or Ikebukuro. So I like there.
  It's very useful and   my house fee is very cheap. And   my room is   very big so
I decided that.
No. My family live in 
in  prefecture.
 I have parents and  I have two brothers, elder brothers,   and  my father is   publisher?   he is publishing newspaper  for the doctors. And  my mother helps him and  she is now  counseling other people.

 it's very difficult.

And  practice every day or

  a  woman is sitting  chair. And    she is now  playing personal computer. And a cat is lying on the bed. And the dog is lying under the bed. And door is open. And  now nine o'clock.   it's June.      there is telephone and typewriter  and  audio player.  And the woman wearing green  sweater and blue skirt.  That's it.

   I have no bed and I have   no pets.  And I also have personal computer.    my room has bigger window.   and perhaps this room is in the house. But my  room is one apartment.
 I use it for the e-mail and Internet.  and sometimes I write diary.
Yeah.

.  One day last week  I thought  I will try to cook new  menu. But   no stuff is in the  refrigerator. So I go to supermarket   by car. And I choose the stuffing and ingredients in the market. And  I bought some meat or  fruits or something and     I put the stuff in  my car's trunk of the car. And I go home and I cook the  nice meal.
 sometimes.
 I bought   some,  , ? 
 some  lunch box in the market or go to eat with my friends.
 yes.  I like  Shinjuku area so  some restaurant I like to go.
  one restaurant is the  very narrow and high building. So not so much popular, so it's very  comfortable to  eating and the bread is very nice taste, so I like it.
