<OL>My name is</OL> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Pleased to meet you.<F>Ah</F> no, actually I haven't had lunch today.<F>Ah</F> I had a meeting with someone outside the office, so <F>ah</F> to see <R>and</R> and I didn't have lunch. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes.<R>I usually have lunch</R> <F>ah</F> I <.></.> usually have lunch at <F>er</F> desk, <F>un</F> so my <nvs>cough</nvs> <.></.> <F>un</F> computer to check mails and <.></.> Internet.<OL><F>Um</F> Yes, <F>ahm</F></OL> there is one place <F>ah</F> near <SC>the</SC> <.></.> this office also the station. It's called "Yamaoka". It's a Japanese restaurant, and <nvs>cough</nvs> they are <.></.> <F>um</F> quick and also they have very tasty foods everyday. <CO>So</CO>.You like the fish?They have <.></.> <F>um</F> raw fish, too. <CO>So</CO>. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.<F>Um</F>.<F>Um</F> <F>er</F> recently I go to <F>er</F> <.></.> school <SC>which is</SC> <F>mm</F> where I can learn business skills, presentations or communication skills. <F>Um</F>.<F>Ahm</F> <F>uum</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> there are two types of classes. And <SC>one is</SC> <F>um</F> as I told you, one is presentation and the other one is <F>ah</F> business communication skills. So at <.></.> presentation course, I have to prepare some materials to present <F>ah</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> in front of the all students. And <nvs>cough</nvs> it's hard to do in front of people, but it's interesting. And <F>um</F> the other one <nvs>cough</nvs> business skills is mostly communication skill. So, <F>uum</F> when <.></.> we talk to each other, <F>uhm</F> there is <R>s</R> some kind of role. So <.></.> they teach <F>ahm</F> how to break the wall and expressing yourself. <F>Um</F>.<.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ah</F> yes, I found it very helpful. <SC>I'm taking</SC> <F>ah</F> I'm still taking that course, so <.></.> <F>mm</F> I cannot <R>do</R> do <F>well</F> what I <?>have been</?> learned in the class. But <.></.> <F>um</F> already I can tell some part of me <.></.> <F>un</F> was changed. And I can talk to people <F>ah</F> here very friendly, and also <F>ah</F> <.></.> I couldn't do any <.></.> <R>ne</R> negotiations <SC>like</SC> <F>ahm</F> <SC>so</SC> <.></.> <F>um</F> if someone tell me do something which I don't want to do. I couldn't say no, but recently I can somehow negotiate.Yes. <nvs>cough</nvs> this is a picture of a class. There are <F>ahm</F> <.></.> six students in this class. The teacher is a woman, and she seems to <.></.> be a mathematic teacher <.></.> in a mathematic <R>c</R> class. Those students are not so interested in mathematics, so <nvs>cough</nvs> some are <.></.> chatting, some are listening music and drinking. <.></.> And one man is <F>er</F> chewing <.></.> gum, but <F>er</F> there are two students who are enthusiastic about this class.<F>Mm</F> <F>ahm</F> <.></.> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <.></.> when I was a high school student, our class was <.></.> mostly <nvs>cough</nvs> not like this. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But <R>we were</R> <.></.> <F>um</F> we were <.></.> more <.></.> <F>um</F> enthusiastic, I think. But <F>uum</F> some classes like English conversation class, we were not <R>so</R> <F>uum</F> so happy, so <.></.> we were not <.></.> <F>um</F> interested in what teacher <R>was</R> was saying. <.></.> So we <R>chat</R> <.></.> chatted each other in Japanese, I think, like these two girls.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.Yes, I think <.></.> <F>um</F> high school students nowadays are more <.></.> <F>um</F> self-concerned <.></.> <F>ah</F> than what we were. <R>We</R> we <.></.> did what we were told or <SC>we was sup</SC> <SC>we were said</SC> what we were supposed to do <SC>but</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>ah</F> without thinking its meaning. <.></.> But I think <.></.> high school students nowadays <.></.> do not do what they don't want to do, or they don't understand <SC>what</SC> why they have to do. So <F>uum</F> <R>some</R> <.></.> <SC>some part</SC> <F>um</F> <..></..> <F>um</F> some points, they are doing right things. But <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <.></.> sometimes <F>mm</F> you have to do something you don't want to do <nvs>laughter</nvs> in a lifetime. So <.></.> <F>er</F> <.></.> that's the differences.<.></.> <R>I</R> I <??></??> before. But you <??></??> all right?<OL>O K</OL>. <F>Um</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>Um</F>.
