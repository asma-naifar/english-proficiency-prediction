Marshal ?
 really?   the martial art called  comes from Brazil. And  so far, it's kind of protecting martial art so far because  the slave  come from Africa is so abused many time. So they have to protect them by themselves. Then    the point is they don't use hands,  only legs, or  they stands up there by their hands.
And  it's just like kind of dancing, and they play music by themselves, and  they sing because they prohibited martial arts before.
No.

And you can come to Higashiguchi exit, and you will see big building with planetarium on the top. And   you will see big picture  about "Charlie Angeles". So        I will wait for you  under the picture. O K?
 We're going to see action movie, but sexy,   called "Charlie Angeles".

. You  will like that.
Why?
Because   the action is   so cool, and    three girls are  appearing on the movie. Then probably is music is nice, and  fashion is nice. All of appearance is good, I think.

Yeah, so see you tonight.
Yeah.
.
 so-so.  Actually I'm not going to movie so much.
   I don't go to see the movie so much.
 because I'm so wishy-washy to make up  what I going to see.  .
. Relaxing, drinking.
How do I relax? Listening to the music.
  recently, I'll listen to classic music. Guitar, piano is makes me so secure.
 no, .
. 
.
 O K.
All right.
.   one day, a boy and his father went to a restaurant. And the entrance, they choose no smoking seat. And  waitress come to get their order, and   the son ordered fish and beer, and  his father ordered  a glass of wine and chicken. And  they have good time. And  that day was  his father's bill, and  his son had a good time. And   they separate at night. They have a good time.
 this son and father living separately because  this son  is going to university, second grade. So     son and his  father met  for the first time in   half a year. So  it's a kind of special day for them.
Me?   my father own his small  Japanese restaurant. So  we see at least   in a day a week.
Yeah. We talk a lot about many things. 
?  recently we talking about his retirement 
    my job and    his health and   my grandma's health. .
.  I like him to   whatever he retire or not, I'm O K  because   he've been working for   forty years. So that's enough. Quit anytime or  if his health allows his work, it's O K to continue working.  I don't care,  but first thing is  I like to   take care about his health and body. That's  most important thing.
 .
.
Yes.
.
Usually,  it's depends the  what kind of  you have. But usually   when I go to eat in restaurant with my friends,  we same bill back to we paid  Dutch. But  when I go to restaurant with my boyfriend,  I like to  he pay for me. But after that, I pay him half or thirty percent. 
 sometimes. But  he is not so  rich. I mean    he earn money so-so, but if he pay me every time,  we can not go out for . So that's problem.
.
O K. Thank you.
Probably.

Yes.
 on the way to come here, I mean on the way to come to office, I thinking about today's plan. So I have to hurry up this, hurry up this, hurry up this. 
. O K.
