Good afternoon.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yes. <F>Ehm</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes.<F>Ehm</F>. Good. <F>Em</F>. Weather is fine and warm.This morning?Just as usual. Yeah. Just <SC>get up</SC> got up in the morning and <F>em</F> made my husband lunchclean the room.Yeah.Yes.My husband? <F>Ah</F>. My husband is much younger than me.And he works for <F>em</F> American company, and he <SC>is</SC> <?>uses</?> English for his job. And, <F>eh</F> what else? My husband and I <.></.> like to snowboard. So, every weekend, we go to mountainside.Every weekend in winter.Yeah. What else <R>my</R> my husband? <F>Mm</F>. He is kind of <laughter>eccentric person</laughter>. <F>Uhm</F>. <OL>Yeah</OL>.He is funny, and <F>eh</F> <.></.> <R>he</R> he is unusual as a Japanese man. <F>Mm</F>.<OL><R>I mean that</R> I mean that</OL> he doesn't seem to think that <F>eh</F> women should do this do that, and men should do this do that, <R>other</R> other Japanese men tend to think.<OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.<F>Eh</F>. Now, I'm <SC>a</SC> just a housewife. So, can I say housewife?<OL><R>House</R></OL> housewife, yes. So, mainly, I do all the stuff, you know, house, and he works. But, later, <F>umm</F> probably, I hope I can find a kind of job, and then, we can share housework.<F>Ah</F>. I used to teach at an elementary school, so the only thing I can do is just teaching. So, yeah, I hope that I can get a teaching job <.></.> <OL>like before</OL>.<F>Ah</F>. My major is actually Japanese. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Uhm</F>.Maybe, I can teach anything <F>uhm</F> elementary school level.<F>Uhm</F>. Because <F>ah</F> I wanted to go to the States with my husband. And, in order to get the <R>vis</R> <SC>visa</SC> yeah, visa, <F>ah</F> we had to marry. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <SC>it</SC> it's <??></??> funny story <SC>but</SC> so that why I quit my job and got married and went to the States for a while, then came back.Yes.<OL><F>Em</F> <?>I think</?>, basically, it's depends</OL> on the area. <F>Er</F>. And, <F>eh</F> <SC>even though</SC> even before I went to the States, I thought that a Japanese media only <F>eh</F> gave us a bad news mainly in the United States. So <SC>I thought that's</SC> <F>ah</F> in my opinion, <SC>i</SC> ordinary people are not so different from Japanese ordinary people. And then, I went to the States, and, there, <R>it's</R> <F>ah</F> it's called up-state New York, so <SC>even it</SC> even it's in <?>di</?> New York States, that's very rural area and small city there. So I went to <F>ah</F> elementary school several times, then, I found that the kids in those schools are much much better, behave good than Japanese <OL>ordinary <??></??>, yes</OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>You're welcome</OL>.<OL><laughter><F>Uhm</F></laughter> yeah</OL>. <F>Ahm</F>. It's a scene on the <R>ski</R> <SC>ski area</SC> ski resort, I think. And I see, <SC>it's</SC> probably, it's not in Japan, it's somewhere in Europe, and there are <?>several</?> people enjoy skiing. <R>And</R> and there's one snowboarder, because I'm a snowboarder. <CO>So</CO>. And, <F>am</F> this part, <F>ah</F> there're several children playing <F>ah</F> there, I don't know what it's called, but they're throwing snowballs and fighting each other <F>eh</F> just for fun. And then, the <SC>other side</SC> upper left side of this picture, <F>err</F> one couple is <R>si</R> sitting. And, what else? <.></.> Probably he or she, I don't know, but <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> teach her how to ski. <.></.> There are another couple. Probably, there another couple, and she is much better than him. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Em</F>. <?>Just the</?> atmosphere. <F>Hum</F>. <..></..> Yeah. <R>Ju</R> just for <OL>atmosphere. <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>Atmosphere</OL>? <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> <F>uhm</F>. At first, the ski lift <SC>is not</SC> doesn't seem to be very new one, so I think that's in probably Europe, <SC>there still</SC> <F>ah</F> they have still the old <F>ah</F> ski lift. So, probably, that's why I think it's in Europe.<nvs>laughter</nvs> I don't know.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Advice? <OL><F>Ah</F> for <SC>snowboarding</SC> <R>snow</R> snowboarding</OL>?O K. <F>Em</F>. The one big difference between <F>ah</F> skiing and snowboarding is that, <F>ah</F> <SC>the snowboa</SC> <SC>for snowboarder</SC> for a snowboarder, <F>ah</F> <.></.> both legs <SC>are</SC> <.></.> must be stick to a board. So it's very dangerous once you lose the balance. So, <SC>it's very</SC> be careful about the falling down. So <SC>first, you ha</SC> the first thing you have to learn is that how to fall down.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.<F>Hum</F>.<F>Hum</F>.Hello. <F>Eh</F>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes.<F>Ah</F>. I have to say <?>you</?>, sorry about the party, because I can't attend the party.<F>Ah</F>. I'm sorry. I wanted, but a circumstances doesn't allow me to do that. I'm very sorry, but, now, my husband got <F>ah</F> very bad flu, and I have to stay at my home with him.<F>Ah</F>. Yeah, of course. But <F>ahm</F> his symptom is <R>not</R> not so light, <SC>it's very</SC> <SC>he seems to be very</SC> actually, he got a high fever <.></.> and dehydration. So, <SC>I have to</SC> probably, <SC>I have to take care of</SC> it's better to take care of him.<OL><F>Ah</F> we already did</OL>. We went. And then, just came back right now. <F>Eh</F>. <SC>So</SC> <.></.> but, next time, I'd love to attend, so, please forgive me this time.<OL><F>Oh</F> really? <F>Uh-huh</F></OL>. I love to eat your <JP>sushi</JP>. I'm very sorry. Yeah, but this time, probably, I should stay home.Thank you.And enjoy your party.Bye.<OL><F>Ah</F> yes</OL>.<OL><F>Ah</F> both, I like both</OL>.<F>Am</F>. Basically, <F>eh</F> I'm not good at cooking, so potluck party is fine to me.<F>Hum</F>.<F>Ah</F>. I like to meet people, so, when I invite <F>ah</F> some of my friends, I tell them it's a potluck party. So they have to bring something to eat, just one stuff. So, basically, when I invite someone, basically I tell <F>ah</F> one of them, <F>ah</F> "<SC>Plo</SC> "Please <F>ah</F> bring something to drink.", and "Please bring something to eat or <F>ah</F> some dessert." or something like that.Other things?<OL><F>Ah</F> just</OL> eat and chat. I like to talk with other people, so, mainly, yeah, especially in the States, they seem to <F>urm</F> have fun to talk with each other.<F>Uhm</F>. Even though they don't have any <F>ah</F> entertainment other than just chatting, it's O K.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Ah</F>. I seldom turn down <nvs>laughter</nvs> invitation, <F>ah</F> so, even if my husband got sick, probably I can go out to the party. <SC>That was</SC> <R>if</R> if I can, I have to do that. <F>Er</F>. <SC>I tell them</SC> I call them, and, yeah, just to say my situation honestly.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Hum</F>.<OL><F>Ah</F> so</OL>, in order? One, two, six.<F>Uh-huh</F> <F>uh-huh</F> <F>ah</F> <F>well</F>. <.></.> Can I have <?>other</?> time?<F>Ahhh</F>.<F>Hmm</F>. O K. So, <SC>last Sunday, <F>eh</F> Kimio was on a way</SC> <F>ah</F> no, last Friday, Kimio is on a way to work and <SC>as usual</SC> <F>ah</F> this morning, he was a little late, so he was in a hurry. And <.></.> Manabu was on a way to date his girlfriend. And <SC>he is</SC> <F>er</F> he was calling his girlfriend to tell her that <R>he was</R> <.></.> he was at a waiting point as usual. And then, <F>ah</F> suddenly, <F>er</F> Manabu was so <R>care</R> careless and drop his cell phone on a Kimio's car. And Kimio was very <F>er</F> shocked and stopped his car. And Kimio was angry at Manabu's dropping <F>ah</F> <R>cell</R> <R>cell</R> <R>cell</R> cellphone. But Manabu was also angry at Kimio's <.></.> attitude. And then, they decided to call the police. And Kimio explained the policeman about the accident. <.></.> And, finally, <R>using the</R> using the cellphone <F>ah</F> during driving bike is against the law, so Manabu was lost his fight, and police get rid of his bike. <laughter>That's all</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.My car? My car is Honda. <F>Ah</F>. The reason I bought the car Honda is that my husband and I like Honda.<F>Hum</F>. The reason why we like Honda is because Honda is a first car company in Japan to participate in <F>ah</F> the car race <F>ah</F> <R>so</R> so called F One, Formula One car race. And, there, Honda won as <SC>a</SC> not a driver but as a car. So we like Honda. <F>Eh</F>. That's why we bought Honda. <OL><CO>Actually</CO></OL>.No, no no no no. <R>It's</R> <F>er</F> it's Odyssey, so it's <F>eh</F> kind of one-box car. And, as I said before, <F>ah</F> we go snowboarding every weekend, so we need a big car to carry a lot of stuffincluding two boards.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F> <F>hum</F></OL>. And, for me, car is just a car, just <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> drive and carry us somewhere else, but, for my husband, or I assume that most of men, car is something like a precious for them, kind of like a accessory, or <.></.> <F>um</F> I don't know. <SC>But</SC> <F>eh</F> so the attitude <SC>for</SC> toward car is very different from the woman's attitude.<F>Hum</F>.<F>Um</F>. Probably. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Ah</F>. We seldom <laughter>washes the car</laughter>. <laughter>It's a different thing</laughter>. <R>We love</R> we love <SC>my</SC> our car. <.></.> Probably, we are <SC>lazy</SC> too lazy to <R>take</R> <R>take</R> take care of our car.Thank you.This afternoon? <F>Ah</F>. Yes. <F>Ah</F>. I'm going to the school.<OL><F>Hum</F> now, I'm</OL> learning English. <F>Hum</F>.<F>Ah</F>. My school is <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H>.Thank you very much.
