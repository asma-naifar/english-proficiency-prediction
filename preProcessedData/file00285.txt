Good afternoon.
.
Yes. . My name is .
Yes.
. Good. . Weather is fine and warm.
This morning?
Just as usual. Yeah. Just got up in the morning and made my husband lunch
clean the room.
Yeah.
Yes.
My husband? . My husband is much younger than me.
And he works for American company, and he English for his job. And, what else? My husband and I like to snowboard. So, every weekend, we go to mountainside.
Every weekend in winter.
Yeah. What else my husband? . He is kind of . . .
He is funny, and he is unusual as a Japanese man. .
 I mean that women should do this do that, and men should do this do that, other Japanese men tend to think.
.
. Now, I'm just a housewife. So, can I say housewife?
 probably, I hope I can find a kind of job, and then, we can share housework.
. I used to teach at an elementary school, so the only thing I can do is just teaching. So, yeah, I hope that I can get a teaching job .
. My major is actually Japanese. . .
Maybe, I can teach anything elementary school level.
. Because I wanted to go to the States with my husband. And, in order to get the yeah, visa, we had to marry. And it's so that why I quit my job and got married and went to the States for a while, then came back.
Yes.
 , basically, it's depends. And, even before I went to the States, I thought that a Japanese media only gave us a bad news mainly in the United States. So in my opinion, ordinary people are not so different from Japanese ordinary people. And then, I went to the States, and, there, it's called up-state New York, so even it's in New York States, that's very rural area and small city there. So I went to elementary school several times, then, I found that the kids in those schools are much much better, behave good than Japanese , yes.

.
. . It's a scene on the ski resort, I think. And I see, probably, it's not in Japan, it's somewhere in Europe, and there are people enjoy skiing. and there's one snowboarder, because I'm a snowboarder. . And, this part, there're several children playing there, I don't know what it's called, but they're throwing snowballs and fighting each other just for fun. And then, the upper left side of this picture, one couple is sitting. And, what else? teach her how to ski. 
. atmosphere. . just for 
? . At first, the ski lift doesn't seem to be very new one, so I think that's in probably Europe, they have still the old ski lift. So, probably, that's why I think it's in Europe.
 I don't know.
.
Advice? for snowboarding?
O K. . The one big difference between skiing and snowboarding is that, for a snowboarder, be careful about the falling down. So the first thing you have to learn is that how to fall down.
.
.
.
.
Hello. . This is .
Yes.
. I have to say , sorry about the party, because I can't attend the party.
. I'm sorry. I wanted, but a circumstances doesn't allow me to do that. I'm very sorry, but, now, my husband got very bad flu, and I have to stay at my home with him.
. Yeah, of course. But his symptom is not so light, actually, he got a high fever probably, it's better to take care of him.
 we already did. but, next time, I'd love to attend, so, please forgive me this time.
 really? . I'm very sorry. Yeah, but this time, probably, I should stay home.
Thank you.
And enjoy your party.
Bye.
 yes.
 both, I like both.
. Basically, I'm not good at cooking, so potluck party is fine to me.
.
. I like to meet people, so, when I invite some of my friends, I tell them it's a potluck party. So they have to bring something to eat, just one stuff. So, basically, when I invite someone, basically I tell one of them, " "Please bring something to drink.", and "Please bring something to eat or some dessert." or something like that.
Other things?
 just have fun to talk with each other.
. Even though they don't have any entertainment other than just chatting, it's O K.
.
. I seldom turn down invitation, so, even if my husband got sick, probably I can go out to the party. if I can, I have to do that. . I call them, and, yeah, just to say my situation honestly.
.
.
 so, in order? One, two, six.
 . time?
.
. O K. So, Kimio was on a way no, last Friday, Kimio is on a way to work and this morning, he was a little late, so he was in a hurry. And he was calling his girlfriend to tell her that suddenly, Manabu was so careless and drop his cell phone on a Kimio's car. And Kimio was very shocked and stopped his car. And Kimio was angry at Manabu's dropping cellphone. But Manabu was also angry at Kimio's And, finally, using the cellphone during driving bike is against the law, so Manabu was lost his fight, and police get rid of his bike. . 
Yes.
My car? My car is Honda. . The reason I bought the car Honda is that my husband and I like Honda.
. The reason why we like Honda is because Honda is a first car company in Japan to participate in the car race so called F One, Formula One car race. And, there, Honda won as not a driver but as a car. So we like Honda. . That's why we bought Honda. .
No, no no no no. it's Odyssey, so it's kind of one-box car. And, as I said before, we go snowboarding every weekend, so we need a big car to carry a lot of stuff
including two boards.
 drive and carry us somewhere else, but, for my husband, or I assume that most of men, car is something like a precious for them, kind of like a accessory, or I don't know. so the attitude toward car is very different from the woman's attitude.
.
. Probably. 
. We seldom . . we love our car. too lazy to take care of our car.
Thank you.
This afternoon? . Yes. . I'm going to the school.
 now, I'm.
. My school is .
Thank you very much.
