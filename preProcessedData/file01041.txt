It's little expensive for me but that's O K.  and   I got the necktie and then  the department  had a final sale so I  want something for me so I  go upstairs for lady's floor and   I'm looking something for me.  The shoes are final sale,   thirty percent off .   I'm checking but I didn't buy them and there, I went to the   lady's   casual wear's floors and   they had a sale    five percent off so      I checked the nice sweater and   I want it and I'm checking    other wears but I wanted   this one so  I decided to buy it and  I have many  bags  bringing and     I went home.
