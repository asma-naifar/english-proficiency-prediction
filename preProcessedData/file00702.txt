My name is .
Nice to meet you.
  . Thanks. 
. I live in       where my company has a dormitory.
O K.      our department is now very  busy to work. So  we go home late. So   we  only sleep . 
 but it's very  comfortable.
Yes.
Bad point.  .    the room has only one window so       so the      air in the room doesn't     get clean.
.
Free time?

Weekend.
. I often  meet  my friends, and  go out. For example, to the  Kawaguchi Lake.
. Or bay area,
 or Odaiba.
Yeah.
. I like driving.
. So    Kawaguchi lake is located on moderate distance from Tokyo.
. And        it has  clean air. .
