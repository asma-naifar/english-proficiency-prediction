But <F>em</F> my favorite restaurant these days is <F>er</F> more lively one. We love Italian restaurant. And <F>er</F> it is located near here. And <F>em</F> it's rather noisy. And <F>er</F> <F>em</F> there are so many tables close together. And food are reasonable. The wines are reasonable.

Many many many times.<F>Em</F> as matter of fact, yeah, <R>I</R> I went to <R>the</R> the guy who was standing over there, I mean in the station. And I talked like this, and managed. Then <R>most</R> most of the case was their fault. As you know in Europe and in <F>eh</F> South <R>East</R> East Asian country, <F>em</F> their <F>em</F> train schedule is terrible. They go much earlier than <R>the</R> the schedule or much later than the schedule. And so <F>em</F> <R>it</R> it didn't make me so <?>trouble</?>. <F>Mm</F>. O K.Yes.<?>What are doing this</?>? <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Mhm-hum</F></OL>.Yeah.<F>Mhm-hum</F>.<OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.<F>Mhm-hum</F>. O K. <F>Er</F> it was the story <F>mm</F> occurred one day last week. <F>Em</F> I went to the station as usual at eight o'clock in the morning. And <F>er</F> some guy standing next to me <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> hitted me <F>eh</F> with his elbow. And <R>I</R> I dropped the luggage on the railway. <SC>It was</SC> <F>eh</F> I was so furious, and <F>eh</F> <SC>I told that <F>mm</F> <F>em</F> that guy</SC> <R>I</R> I complained about it. <F>Eh</F> and <F>er</F> asked him <SC>m pi</SC> asked him to pick up my luggage. But he said that he couldn't do this because <SC>it is so</SC> it was so dangerous. <nvs>sniff</nvs> Then the shortly after that accident, <SC>the</SC> a train came into the platform. And roll over my luggage. And I was so shocked because in that <F>er</F> luggage, <R>I had</R> <F>em</F> I had very important papers for my company. But <F>em</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> <F>eh</F> after that train <F>em</F> leave this platform, I was so relieved because my luggage is just in between of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the railway. <F>Ur</F> so that <SC>it was not crushed</SC> it was not destroyed. <F>Em</F> <SC>it saved</SC> it save my life. And <F>em</F> then <F>er</F> the station man <SC?>in</SC?> came, and went down on <R>the</R> the railway, and get me <R>the</R> the luggage. <F>Ah</F> I went to the office as usual. It was a kind of terrible day, but in the end, it was O K.Here in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>. <F>Eh</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>, <F>i</F> <F>eh</F> <F>em</F> they are well scheduled. And <SC>every train</SC> <SC>most of</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> most trains come on time. And <F>eh</F> <F>mm</F> they are so clean. The most passengers are very quiet. Not really, but yes, compared to in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>. <F>Em</F> and also, <SC>they are well</SC> <F>eh</F> other said it is well organized. The reason is that every station in Japan, we have <F>er</F> station men to see the ticket, <SC>and</SC> I mean to check the ticket, and so on. But in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>, <F>em</F> they rarely have the station men. And the train itself is very dirty, <F>eh</F> often very <R>sme</R> smelly. And as I said <F>er</F> before, <F>er</F> train often delayed. <R>A</R> also <F>em</F> <?>O K, that sort of things</?>. In Japan, very convenient. But also <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> yes, I can say that in <H pn="others7">XXX08</H>, <F>er</F> railway system is very convenient. Well organized compared with, I say France or Asian ones.Yes.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.<F>Mm</F> I haven't decided it, yet. But <F>er</F> <F>em</F> certainly, if I passed the exam of I don't know in English <F>em</F> <F>eh</F> first grade of <JP>Eiken</JP>, <nvs>laughter</nvs> I will.<F>Em</F> as far as I remember, <F>eh</F> June.June something.<F>Ah</F> yes.<F>Mm</F>.This interview. <F>Er</F> <SC>previous</SC> <F>em</F> <SC>the ladies</SC> two ladies that you had this morning before I came here, <F>em</F> they are my friend.<R>And</R> so <R>we</R> <F>eh</F> we are going to have a lunch.Yes.Yes, it is.Thank you very much.Yes.
