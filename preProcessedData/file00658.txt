It is called the <JP>gakuen toshi</JP>, <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> but actually, it's not so <F>ur</F> organized, yet. There are lots of trees and greenery so <SC>I</SC> <R>it's</R> it's kind of between the country side and the urban city.<OL>Good point</OL> of <F>eu</F> <R>s</R> staying there is that we have two children so <R>it's</R> it's very good as an environment because they have greenery. So our children enjoy and going in prime trees and sort of things. But at the same time, <F>ur</F> my working place is very close so it's very convenient. Yeah.

And but there's a kind of story compared with <F>ur</F> "Jurassic Park". So I really enjoyed it.Yeah.Yeah, very interesting, yeah.

Two men are skiing. And this is I think the ski resort. <R>And</R> <F>ur</F> and there's a cottage here. And those who don't want to <F>ur</F> skiing, <F>ur</F> they just enjoying <F>ur</F> have a cup of tea. And there's a ski lift, and <SC>they're going</SC> while they're going down, they can going up using the lift. And <SC>they're</SC> <F>ur</F> some of them are good. They can ski together. But some are <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> maybe he's not good at skiing, maybe he is just a beginner. And the children who don't want to <F>urr</F> skiing, <F>ur</F> they just enjoy <F>ur</F> throwing the snow balls. And <R>they</R> they had <F>ur</F> very <F>urr</F> <R>good</R> good time, <R>I</R> I think. And <F>ur</F> how many minutes?Yeah.Yeah.<F>Uh</F>. No. <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> so far, I tried only once.<R>It</R> it was, I don't know, about fifteen years ago maybe. <F>Ur</F> One of my friends ask me to go together. And <SC>it was there with</SC> <SC>this is like</SC> this is you know, like you know, me you know. <SC><R>I</R> <F>urm</F> I can't ski at all</SC> <R>I</R> I couldn't ski at all. And <F>ur</F> I fell down a lot. And <F>ur</F> my hips you know, becomes kind of red, I guess maybe. You know, so wet and <F>ur</F> <SC>I</SC> at that time, <R>I</R> I promised that I would never play ski again. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah. It was terrible.Yeah.O K.<F>Mm</F>.O K.<F>Well</F> actually I participated in the tour. <F>Err</F> <F>eh</F> I thought it was very gorgeous. And <F>ur</F> however, when I participated in the tour, <F>urr</F> I found the so many things are different.<F>Urm</F>. And <R>I</R> I want you to compensate the money I paid.<F>Urm</F>. For example, when I <SC>went</SC> arrive at the hotel, and <SC>I had</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I think I ordered the suit room. But <SC>it was kind of similar bi</SC> <F>ur</F> it's kind of just a double room. There is no furniture or kitchen at all. So <F>urm</F> <R>I</R> I couldn't cook for my partner, and I couldn't stay there for many hours because the room is very narrow. <SC>So</SC> but <R>at</R> at first, I thought that I <F>urm</F> made a appointment at a suit room. But which was different.Yeah.Yes, I talked <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to the hotel manager.But <SC>he said <R>it</R> it</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>he said <R>we</R> we</SC> <SC>they</SC> he said he didn't have a suit room. And there is no point I could get into the <F>ur</F> suit room. But you know, <SC>the</SC> <R>as</R> as a plan, I've already ordered the suit room. So <F>ur</F> and I've already paid. That's the point.<F>Oh</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> but <R>you</R> <R>you</R> you know, <F>ur</F> at first, <SC>the</SC> there's a statement that <SC>the</SC> <F>urr</F> if something wrong happened, <F>urr</F> the company <F>er</F> paid it back to me. So <R>it</R> it actually stated. So I think you should do something about it. <SC>You</SC> and you should talk to the I think the manager I think.Yeah.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>. O K. Good.<OL>Thanks a lot</OL>.O K.Thank you.<F>Urm</F>. <F>Urm</F>. I don't know. <SC>The</SC> many many years ago, <F>ur</F> I stayed at <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> and also the <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>. And <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I like <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> very much because <F>ur</F> <F>eh</F> <F>ur</F> it's very country side. But in autumn time, though it's cold, <SC>the</SC> I saw <SC>the very</SC> you know, the leaves are turn yellow and red, <R>and</R> <R>and</R> and the sky is very clear. And <SC>they</SC> any people enjoy the scenery because they clean the <R>grass</R> grass <R>and</R> <F>ur</F> and every Sunday. And <R>they</R> they have their own garden. And when I went driving, the scenery is so beautiful. And I went to the some kind of cottage. And they actually <F>urr</F> got <SC>maple tree <R>out</R> out of mei</SC> maple sugar out of the tree. And <SC>I'm</SC> I was very impressed. Yeah. <R>I wish</R> I wish I could live there <R>for</R> for many years.Actually I went there <F>urr</F> to study <F>ur</F> <SC>to</SC> in order to get master's degree for about one year. So yeah, I couldn't stay there longer.Yeah.That's the city <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I like the most.<F>Urm</F>. <SC>A man's driving</SC> <F>ur</F> a man is driving. <F>Ur</F>. <SC>He want</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>he want to go</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>he want to</SC> <F>ur</F> I think <R>he</R> he want to work <F>ur</F> at a company. So he is heading for the company. <R>And</R> and <R>on</R> on the opposite way, <F>urr</F> a man who is driving a motorcycle. And unfortunately, <R>he</R> he had a conversation with his girl friend. And he didn't pay attention to the front. <.></.> And when the car is turning around, <F>er</F> the car hit the motorbike, and he <F>urr</F> dropped off his <F>er</F> cell phone. And he got angry. And he said that you know, <F>ur</F> "Look at my bike, you know, it's broken.". <SC>And the</SC> but <F>mm</F> the man got angry, too because <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he didn't pay attention to the car. And he insist that <F>er</F> "I was not wrong. <F>Er</F> You are the person who were very careless.". And so <F>ur</F> anyway they called the police. And <SC>he insist that he is actually</SC> he said, "<R>The</R> <SC>the man is using the</SC> it was using the phone <F>ur</F> while <SC>he's</SC> he was driving.". And police was <F>ur</F> listening to them. <R>And</R> and anyway, <F>er</F> <F>err</F> since <SC><R>the</R> the motor</SC> <F>ur</F> he can't use the motorbike, so he ask the rent-a-car to <F>ur</F> carry to <F>urr</F> maybe their repaired <F>urr</F> shop. And <R>he</R> he went back.<F>Mm</F>.<F>Well</F> <F>urr</F> to tell you the truth, once. <OL><nvs>laughte</nvs></OL>But <SC>it's not</SC> it was not so serious because I just <SC>in <F>ur</F> going back</SC> <F>urr</F> went backward for a little, and it <SC>turn</SC> turned around to the different directions. But I <F>ur</F> went backward a little bit faster so I hit the <F>urr</F> reared <F>ur</F> corner to the kind of white wall. So <F>urr</F> <R>my</R> my car little bit <SC>ss</SC> kind of scar. But I think <R>it</R> it was O K. And <F>ur</F> I was relieved it was not human. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah.That was an accident. So <SC>I</SC> so far so good. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urr</F>. By car?Definitely not.<OL>I couldn't</OL>, you know. <SC>The i</SC> <F>ur</F> somebody told me that in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, the road, <SC>wa</SC> it's a bit wider than the road in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. And <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I thought that you know, the reason why I could drive safely is that <SC>the</SC> because of the wide of the road. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>So <F>urr</F> I've never tried driving in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. Traffic is so terrible, I think. And <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I think I can't do it well.<F>Urm</F>. <SC>Many people</SC> that's why many people, <F>urm</F> I think they drive over speed anyway. So I have to be careful. And particularly I have to be careful if <R>the</R> the man in front using the cell phone sometimes. And <SC>his</SC> <R>the</R> the way of driving <R>is</R> is <F>ur</F> strange. At that time, I have to be slow down, and try to keep distant from him. Yeah.Yeah, that's the thing I have to be careful. <OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Mm-hm</F>. Yes. <SC><R>A</R> after</SC> <F>ur</F> yeah, after finishing this interview.Yes.<F>Well</F> <F>urr</F>yeah. Anywhere by train, <F>ur</F> I go the <F>ur</F> <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> Station. And then I use the bus directly to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Yeah. <SC>So it takes about</SC> but <SC><R>it</R> it take</SC> sometime it takes about more than two hours from <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>when the traffic is very terrible.Yeah.Sometimes. Yeah, very crowded. <F>Uh</F> <F>uh</F>. Particularly <SC>this</SC> <F>ur</F> around of this hours.Yeah.Friday evenings.<F>Urr</F>. <SC>It</SC> I think it's very frequent. Every fifteen minutes. So I think I manage that.Yeah. Yeah. <OL>That's right</OL>.Yeah.O K. Thank you very much.Thank you.
