 . My name is .
. Nice to meet you, too.
Everyday? . I usually stay at home. so, twice a week, I go to to take English lesson. . And, once a week, I go to sports club for taking exercise class. .
Exercise class, yes. . near my house, there is a sports club. . It's called Tipness. . I think one of famous sports club in Tokyo. And I could joined any class what's I like. . They offered a time table everyday. . For example, Yoga class, swimming class, boxing class and jazz dance, and yes, like that.
. Yes. . Recently, I found Hawaiian dance class. Yes. That's very interesting. Yes. It makes me out of stress. Yes. . It makes me fun, relax. .
. Yes. . I was born in Aichi prefecture and grew up there. And, after I marriage, I had lived in Shizuoka prefecture for three years. And, after that, I had lived in Brussels in Europe for three years. . And, after we came back to Japan, we lived in Shizuoka for two years again. And, last Spring, we moved to .
. Very each time, after I moved a certain place, I always found each place is very good, very comfortable and very cozy for me. .
 .
. Yes. Last time.
 . this is a inside of the gorgeous restaurant. . Pianist is playing the piano for background music. And there is a big clock on the wall. It looks very old. And there are three table, and each table a couples, woman and man sitting the table in the middle in this picture, man is selecting wine for today's special menu, I think.
. yes, I like to, yeah.
. Last? Yeah. . Two weeks ago, went to we went to Hotel Okura to hear some music. . They offered free concert at the moment because Hotel Okura's anniversary event, I think, twelve fifth anniversary after renewal. . I think so because Hotel Okura looks like older than twenty five years old. So, now, each month, twenty fifth, they offered concert. . And, last month, February, twenty fifth is exactly the date on Sunday. So we could go and joined that concert with our children. And, after that, we went to Italian restaurant near there because my husband recommend us to take dinner at this restaurant. . he usually works very near from this area, so he knows about it very well. And we took some pizzas or some , and with some wine. so in this restaurant the owner in this restaurant is Italian people. . so atmosphere and taste everything, we were satisfied. .
. Very Italian. .
.
. Yeah.
Yes. . Yesterday, I bought this necktie for my husband. . I thought it was very suitable with my husband. . But, last night, I asked my husband to try this necktie. . We're very sorry, but it is not good for him. . He is very big man, and . Because, in this necktie, there is very small dot. . So we're very sorry it is not good for him.
So I know I'm not allowed to pay my money back to me, but is comple my husband just tried it only once. . .
 . I know that is my fault, but it looks very new, and no scars, and no spot at all. And just he tried once. so, could I change another tie, ?
. So, if I select new necktie, it cost more than this. I paid extra money. . I don't mind. . So, could I?
Yes.
 .
 . Thank you.
 . "Trouble"?
 . "Trouble" is not "travel", "trouble".
"Trouble". Yes. . Like that?
Problem? . Yes, a lot of . . So, when we stayed Brussels, my children used to go to kindergarten like Japan. And I thought most of the people living in Brussels could manage to understand English, I thought before I left Japan. But nobody can understand English. So I had a lot of trouble at their kindergarten. . So I decided to take French lesson over there, and, finally, I could communicate with them. But children also had a lot of problem and also had misunderstanding with the teachers. . But in the other hand, we had a lot of good experience over there. .
 one day last week, I found there was nothing in the refrigerator. . I was so shocked because, tomorrow, my son's excursion's day. So I have to make lunch for him. So, after my children went to bed, I drove my car to the supermarket to get some ingredients and vegetable and fruits because this supermarket usually closed ten o'clock P M. So I could manage to get something I have to prepared for lunch next day for his excursion trip. so fina at last, I carried cart to the cashier, and I paid in cash. And I put my sack cart that day, I could sleep happily. And, next day, early in the morning, I wake up, and I could make breakfast as usual, and I could also make for lunch of my son's excursion trip.
After this today? . I will straight go back to my home, and have to drive to station because, two days ago, my husband's computer display suddenly have a trouble, we don't know what's reason. So we called electric shop. And, today, so the computer I will bring our computer to the electric shop near the station.
Thank you very much.
