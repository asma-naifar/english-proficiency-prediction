We ordered a course menu. But I'm a vegetarian so I really have to choose every time I go to a restaurant. That's one thing I really need to be careful about. Because in Japan, it's really hard to get vegetarian mealswhile in the U S A, it's very easy to find. But here, it's hard. <R>So</R> <OL><F>urm</F></OL>so when I order, I always have to askwhat's insideof this. <F>Urm</F> so that is my <laughter>memory</laughter>.

That was the biggest thing. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>That just</OL> stuck in my memory.<F>Urm</F> my mom was driving. And <F>ur</F> she usually <SC>took</SC> doesn't take that road. It was <F>ur</F> like a dangerous street. But it was a short-cut to our house.And she was in a hurry.So she had no choice so she took that road. I think it was near Santa Monica. I forgot. But anyway, we <F>ur</F> stopped at a traffic light. And <F>ur</F> two men were walking in front of us.And among all these other people.And one of them just looked up at me and he just kind of went like that <OL>with the gun</OL>.And I noticed that at that moment, and I freaked and I just was quiet. I couldn't do anything. And my mom didn't know. She was like you know, looking around, waiting for the light to change. And I was like, "<F>Ahhh</F>.". And then <R>the</R> the man next to him, <R>he</R> he went like that. <nvs>clap</nvs>And said, "Stop it.".And then they just walked on. And that's how we were saved and survived. <nvs>laughter</nvs> But that was a scary experience.Yes.<OL>Because</OL> it was in L A. And <OL>yeah</OL>.And it's <OL>very dangerous</OL>.since then, I guess,until now. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Oh</F> but</OL> yeah. But <F>urm</F> other than that, I had <F>ur</F> real good friends. There were no Japanesenear my neighborhood or in my school.So <F>ur</F> I had a chance to learn a lot of English. My mom said it was speaking English like <??></??>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I had no choice<OL><??></??></OL> friends.And that was good, and I really had good friends. <OL>And</OL>yeah.<OL><F>Urm</F></OL> It was good. It was fun.I don't like this other part. <OL><laughter>But</laughter> it was really fun</OL>.<OL>No, no, no</OL>. <F>Ur</F>. American people, when they first meet me and they ask me how'd you learn, you know, my English,and I explain that my situation that I live in L A.<OL>They go</OL>, "Yuck.". <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>So I said <F>well</F> it wasn't yuck at that time. And they said, "No, L A. has always been yuck.". <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Since then. But it wasn't that bad. <OL>And</OL>but I lived in west L A.So it was kind of like the center of L A.So <F>ur</F> people who live in California stay refer to the smoky place.<F>Oh</F> that the <OL>place is really</OL>foggy and it's gray <OL>all the</OL> time.Yeah.<OL>But</OL> yeah. So <SC>my friends, I</SC> <F>ur</F> it was hard for us to play outside because you can always get kidnapped or you know, dangerous <OL>things can happen</OL>.So I used to always play with my friends.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL> I went to their homes and they had swimming pools and tennis courts and<OL>that's how I enjoyed</OL>my childhood days. Yeah.<OL>Both <??></??> so</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.Going this wayfrom one to six?<OL>O K</OL>.O K. <F>Urm</F> one day last week, could this be me?O K. <F>Ur</F> my friend and I <R>ww</R> were preparing to go on a camp. <F>Urm</F> and then just go on.O K. <F>Urm</F> we left early in the morning, and arrived at the camp site <F>ur</F> before noontime. And <F>ur</F> we enjoyed preparing the food for lunch, <F>ur</F> setting up the tent. And <F>ur</F> just as we were looking forward to our lunch, we heard <SC>thunder storm</SC> <F>well</F> no, <SC>raining</SC> <F>ur</F> the sound of rain. "<F>Oh-oh</F>.". And then the tent was blown away. Our food was vanished. <F>Ur</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> we escaped inside the car, and <F>ur</F> we found a nice hotel instead. And <F>ur</F> looking at the bright side of it, <nvs>laughter</nvs> the whole story, we ended up in a nice hotel room, bright sunshine the next morning with <F>um</F> comfortable <F>ur</F> <nvs>smack</nvs> environment, <F>ur</F> enjoying tea.Or <SC>maybe thi</SC> no, this is maybe night time, <F>well</F> could be morning.<nvs>laughter</nvs>O K.Yes.Yes.<OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Ur</F> I mainly cook<OL>at home</OL>.<F>Urm</F> and I'm organic, too.So I order organic foods and I'd rather not eat food outside because I know <R>it's</R> it's poisoned, <laughter>as</laughter> I would put it.<F>Urm</F> genetically modified products are out there. <F>Ur</F> I don't trust it very much. So I order everything, and I would <SC>ra</SC> much rather have my kids eat the same as I do.So <F>ur</F> I enjoy cooking at home <F>ur</F> under the very busy <laughter>circumstances</laughter>.I tryas hard as I can. <F>Urm</F> <F>ur</F> what was your question, sorry?<F>Oh</F> how do I manage. O K. <F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> that's how I do. <F>Urm</F> and then when I go to restaurants with friends, <F>ur</F> I just askin detail <OL>what's</OL> inside.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Or <F>ur</F> "Please omit the <??></??> or whatever <?>is</?> inside.".That's how I do it.But then <F>er</F> I eat a little bit of fish and the fish broth is always in Japanese food.Almost always.So <F>urm</F> my foreign friends who are strictly vegetarians, they call vegans, <F>ur</F> they have a very hard time when they come to Japan.<F>Ur</F><OL>I feel</OL> sorry for them because they can eat maybe tofu.<OL><F>Ur</F></OL> other things,<OL>they</OL> say it's very <OL>hard</OL> to find.Yes.Yes.<nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<OL><F>Well</F></OL> <SC>it wasn't</SC> it did start out as like vegetarianism, but <F>urm</F> <SC>I really didn't like</SC> <F>well</F> I don't like fish that much, but I still eat them. But I didn't like meat.<F>Ur</F> I didn't like eggs at allwhen I was growing up.But mom would serve it, and I would reluctantly eat it. But then like maybe ten, eleven, twelve years ago, I thought <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> people who love to eat meat or eggs, <F>eh</F> <F>eh</F> that's fine.I mean I don't have anything against <OL>them</OL>.But I don't like them and when I'm eating them, that means I'm killing more animals,you know, to provide <OL><?>because</?> they provide</OL>.<F>Ur</F> when I thought about that, I said I'm gonna stop.And then <F>ur</F> my daughter, <SC>when she was</SC> I think when she was in first grade, she said the same thing as I did.So<OL><SC>as</SC> but</OL> as I was growing up, I was eating.So I didn't know how that would effecta young, you know, body.So I wasn't sure so I said, "If you are copying mom, I don't want you to do that," you know."Just followwhatever you want to.". And she said, "No, I don't feel like eating meat. <R>I</R> I don't believe animals were born to be eaten.". So I said, "O K.".<CO>So you know</CO>.<OL>Yeah, <R>she's</R></OL> she's determined. <OL>Yes</OL>.<OL>So</OL> she stopped. So she's been stopping for quite a while.<OL><F>Ur</F></OL> my son started saying the same thing. <laughter>So</laughter>I'm thinking maybe he'll stop.But he's a boy and he's very energetic.<CO>So I still think he needs to eat chicken or</CO>.<OL>But that</OL> the <R>avian</R> avian flu <laughter>is one concern</laughter> right now. <OL><SC>But</SC> <F>ur</F></OL>yeah, but <F>ur</F> I don't know, he might say the same thingpretty soon.<nvs>laughter</nvs><?>He'll</?> stop.<OL><F>Oh</F> yeah</OL>. I don't cook meat at all <OL>at home</OL>.But he gets <F>ur</F> meat at school<OL>so</OL> but my daughter brings <F>um</F> hot lunch <OL>to school</OL>.So she doesn't have a problem.<F>Mm-hm</F>.O K. <OL>All right</OL>.<OL><F>Ur</F> I think so</OL>.Yeah. <F>Urm</F> our work is pretty much. <F>Um</F> <R>there's</R> there's so many things to do andnot enough time. Always. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<OL><F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> it's <?>been</?> very interesting</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <OL>Thank you</OL>.
