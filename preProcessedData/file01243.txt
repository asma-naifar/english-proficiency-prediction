Good morning. 
 .
It stopped. 
I'm pretty good, thank you.
How about yourself?
.
 not so near. About hour and a half away.
In a city called .
Do you know where that is?
 it's near 
Yeah. .
 not too much.
 planning to move.
I don't like the environment near the base.
And yeah, many other things. Too complicated to explain.

.
 a nearby city called .
Good environment.
.
 sure. I have a daughter who's fourteen. She's in eighth grade.
 her name is . And I have a son who's name is , and he's ten years old. He's in forth grade.
 my kids are pretty busy. My daughter loves to dance
so she's busy going to dance classes.
 my son loves soccer. I mean, he lives soccer 
so he's busy with his soccer games. I play the sanshin if you know what .
 instrument. It's similar to banjo.
So I'm busy with that.
 when we get together, if we ever do, 
 my parents live in 
so we en joy going to the beach
 during the summer time.
 yeah, just rest.

Yes.
 I used to play the classic guitar when I was living in L A.
a long time ago. I took classical guitar classes.
And so I love playing the instrument.
And then I played the drums
after that. But then I always loved the string instrument, and and then I love Okinawa. So it just match. 
My love for Okinawa and my love for string instrument.
 and so it's really fun playing, and you sing at the same time. Yes.
But it's hard because it's in Okinawa language. It's very different from the Japanese language.
If you've ever heard of it, it's .
Yes.
So it's hard to remember the verse and remember the lyrics, but it's interesting.
Keep me awake.

 it's kind of like a school. It's individual teacher.
 it's a small class. We have like twenty to thirty students.
 yeah, compared to bigger classes.
.
 we also have an American student because we live near the base, there're many interested.
Yes. So yes.
 my friend's husband is he's like a coordinator for Okinawan like concerts and stuff like that, events.
And she's a good friend of mine so I asked her have that I can get 
from her husband.
And he said, " you have the right person or there's a right person that nears by actually.".
So I went him.
 I really lucky.
O K. 
Yes.
 I guess they're couple. they're at a very fancy, nice restaurant enjoying wine. I don't know. A woman is playing a piano. looks like a very fancy restaurant because I don't see any kids. 
 three groups of people enjoying the dinner with the sommelier. More? More explanation?
 tree .
 sommelier's in a tuxedo. . That's about it.
 o'clock.
 o'clock.
.
.
.
Right.
 the difference them?
Yes. yeah, a family restaurant is casual, you can order things without worrying about payment. 
 a lot of kids, yeah. I don't see any sommeliers in family restaurants.
Some family restaurants, I guess, serve wine, but not too many.
I don't know. Because I don't drink.
.
Yes. that's about it.
 and you can see family restaurants anywhere
 this fancy restaurant, maybe inside hotels or
downtown Tokyo maybe.
.
 when I went to Okinawa in December with my friend, we went a nice restaurant.
 it was pretty big. what did we eat? We ordered a course menu. But I'm a vegetarian so I really have to choose every time I go to a restaurant. That's one thing I really need to be careful about. Because in Japan, it's really hard to get vegetarian meals
while in the U S A, it's very easy to find. But here, it's hard. 
so when I order, I always have to ask
what's inside
of this. so that is my . But it was yeah, a nice fancy restaurant.
.
.
O K.
. .
 I bought this shirt, but I really didn't like it.
I don't like the color. Can I exchange it?
Why?
. I changed my mind.
I felt that I wanted this gray at that moment,
but I went home and I prefer red.
So I don't wanna wear it.
 how can you help me?
Why?

.
No.
.

I don't like it,
and then I wanted exchange it.
?
 you can always change a policy for me.
 I know that I'm a valuable customer for you.

 can you ?
 can I wait?
O K. What can I do while I'm waiting?
 is there something to drink?
.
 I much prefer coke. ?
 can you get it for me?
 .
.
.
O K.
O K. I'll talk to you then.
.
.
When I was little.
My dad's job got transferred .
 experience in L A. actually I was almost shot. That was the biggest thing. 
 stuck in my memory.
 my mom was driving. And she usually doesn't take that road. It was like a dangerous street. But it was a short-cut to our house.
And she was in a hurry.
So she had no choice so she took that road. I think it was near Santa Monica. I forgot. But anyway, we stopped at a traffic light. And two men were walking in front of us.
And among all these other people.
And one of them just looked up at me and he just kind of went like that .
And I noticed that at that moment, and I freaked and I just was quiet. I couldn't do anything. And my mom didn't know. She was like you know, looking around, waiting for the light to change. And I was like, ".". And then the man next to him, he went like that. 
And said, "Stop it.".
And then they just walked on. And that's how we were saved and survived. But that was a scary experience.
Yes.
 it was in L A. And .
And it's .
since then, I guess,
until now. 
 but other than that, I had real good friends. There were no Japanese
near my neighborhood or in my school.
So I had a chance to learn a lot of English. My mom said it was speaking English like .

I had no choice
 friends.
And that was good, and I really had good friends. 
yeah.
 It was good. It was fun.
I don't like this other part. it was really fun.
. . American people, when they first meet me and they ask me how'd you learn, you know, my English,
and I explain that my situation that I live in L A.
, "Yuck.". 
So I said it wasn't yuck at that time. And they said, "No, L A. has always been yuck.". 
Since then. But it wasn't that bad. 
but I lived in west L A.
So it was kind of like the center of L A.
So people who live in California stay refer to the smoky place.
 that the 
foggy and it's gray time.
Yeah.
 yeah. So it was hard for us to play outside because you can always get kidnapped or you know, dangerous .
So I used to always play with my friends.
 I went to their homes and they had swimming pools and tennis courts and

my childhood days. Yeah.
 so.
.
Going this way
from one to six?
.
O K. one day last week, could this be me?
O K. my friend and I were preparing to go on a camp. and then just go on.
O K. we left early in the morning, and arrived at the camp site before noontime. And we enjoyed preparing the food for lunch, setting up the tent. And just as we were looking forward to our lunch, we heard no, the sound of rain. ".". And then the tent was blown away. Our food was vanished. we escaped inside the car, and we found a nice hotel instead. And looking at the bright side of it, the whole story, we ended up in a nice hotel room, bright sunshine the next morning with comfortable environment, enjoying tea.
Or no, this is maybe night time, could be morning.

O K.
Yes.
Yes.
.
 I mainly cook
.
 and I'm organic, too.
So I order organic foods and I'd rather not eat food outside because I know it's poisoned, I would put it.
 genetically modified products are out there. I don't trust it very much. So I order everything, and I would much rather have my kids eat the same as I do.
So I enjoy cooking at home under the very busy .
I try
as hard as I can. what was your question, sorry?
 how do I manage. O K. that's how I do. and then when I go to restaurants with friends, I just ask
in detail inside.
 Or "Please omit the inside.".
That's how I do it.
But then I eat a little bit of fish and the fish broth is always in Japanese food.
Almost always.
So my foreign friends who are strictly vegetarians, they call vegans, they have a very hard time when they come to Japan.

 sorry for them because they can eat maybe tofu.
 other things,
 say it's very to find.
Yes.
Yes.

Yes.
 it did start out as like vegetarianism, but I don't like fish that much, but I still eat them. But I didn't like meat.
 I didn't like eggs at all
when I was growing up.
But mom would serve it, and I would reluctantly eat it. But then like maybe ten, eleven, twelve years ago, I thought people who love to eat meat or eggs, that's fine.
I mean I don't have anything against .
But I don't like them and when I'm eating them, that means I'm killing more animals,
you know, to provide they provide.
 when I thought about that, I said I'm gonna stop.
And then my daughter, I think when she was in first grade, she said the same thing as I did.
So
 but as I was growing up, I was eating.
So I didn't know how that would effect
a young, you know, body.
So I wasn't sure so I said, "If you are copying mom, I don't want you to do that," you know.
"Just follow
whatever you want to.". And she said, "No, I don't feel like eating meat. I don't believe animals were born to be eaten.". So I said, "O K.".
.
.
 she stopped. So she's been stopping for quite a while.

I'm thinking maybe he'll stop.
But he's a boy and he's very energetic.
.
 the avian flu right now. 
yeah, but I don't know, he might say the same thing
pretty soon.

 stop.
 yeah.
But he gets meat at school
 but my daughter brings hot lunch .
So she doesn't have a problem.
.
O K. .
 I think so.
Yeah. our work is pretty much. there's so many things to do and
not enough time. Always. .
 it's very interesting.
.
