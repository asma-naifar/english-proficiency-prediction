And after that, I <SC>made a practice golf</SC> play golf at a driving range. <R>I</R> I think <??></??> I think more than <R>fifty</R> fifty, I think. And after that, <R>I</R> I went to <F>erm</F> ride my <SC>bi</SC> mountain bike around my house. And I think <R>it's my</R> it's my usual day, I play golf and <SC>my</SC> I go to, you know, cycling.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL> <R>when I</R> when I practice golf, <F>oh</F> I have to practice more because <R>my</R> my golf is not so good as <F>uum</F> the good players, so I have to improve my skills, so. And <SC>I have</SC> I think I have to take a lesson. And <SC>my b</SC> you know, my ball, because most of the time go to right and left or everywhere. Nothing go straight. So <R>I</R> I want to hit my ball as <SC>go to</SC> go straight and so far. <R>But</R> but usually, my ball doesn't go and I have to ask the ball <SC>which</SC> wherethey go <laughter>so</laughter>.Yeah.<F>Uum</F> I think I use my internet and find some. When <SC>I was in</SC> <F>ee</F> I was staying Washington D C and I went practice golf, at there I can find a <R>good</R> <F>erm</F> good coach. Because <R>I</R> <SC>I go</SC> I went there every weekend so <R>I</R> I saw a couple of coach there and <R>I</R> <SC>I know</SC> you know, I found someone <R>who</R> <SC>who feels very</SC> <SC>I</SC> that I can feel <R>comfor</R> comfortable as a coach, so. But in Tokyo, I just returned <F>err</F> two weeks ago, so I have to find someone<OL>that I can</OL> <F>er</F> feel comfortable.<F>Hum</F>.O K.<F>Er</F>.<OL>O K</OL>. <F>Erm</F> I think she is living with <F>erm</F> her family, I think. Because it's not <F>er</F> you know, <F>err</F> apartment, they don't have a kitchen. And she likes, I think, pet <F>um</F> a cat. Because she has <F>er</F> both cat and dog. <.></.> And <.></.> she's using a computer and typewriter. And so I think <R>she's not</R> she's not a student. I think <SC>she</SC> maybe she's a working in an office or office lady. <..></..> And <.></.> <F>er</F> she has a nice stereo, so I think she likes music to listen <F>err</F>. And the most important thing that <F>err</F> <SC>the</SC> <R>her</R> her room is arranged very well, because she has a window in front of <R>her</R> her desk.<OL>So</OL> she can have <F>er</F> good light and the bed is in front of the door, so something happened, <R>she can</R><OL>she can <F>er</F></OL> <R>run</R> run out her room <R>very</R> very easily.Yeah. So it's very diplomatic.<nvs>laughter</nvs>My room is like compact in like a box. I have almost everything <R>in my</R> in my room. And I have mountain bike, and I have a golf club, and I have a T V, and I have a <laughter>computer</laughter> and I have a desk, and I have <R>a</R> a bed. So I don't have <F>er</F> place, you know, <F>er</F> <R>have</R> have a room <R>to</R> to have exercise in my room. So <R>I'm</R> I'm too fit or too tight <OL>in my room</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Yes.<OL>So</OL><R>yeah</R> yeah, I like <?>packed</?>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uhu</F>.<F>Er</F> excuse me?Yeah. <F>Erm</F> I buy a watch yesterday. And you recommended the Nike watch. But you know, <R>I was</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> I was deciding <F>uum</F> the other one <F>erm</F> Nike and Addidas watch <SC>and</SC> but I think Nike watch is very nice but <F>er</F> Addidas watch has a stopwatch inside, and this watch doesn't have. So I want to change, because the price is same <F>um</F>.Yes. But I returned and <R>I thought</R> I thought <R>I</R> I need <F>er</F> the stopwatch. Because <F>uum</F> <R>I</R> I always exercise and <SC>I wa</SC> I have to <R>keep my</R> keep my time <OL>so</OL>.Yes. Of course, but this design looks very well and you recommended me. But I thought that I need the stopwatch <.></.> function <OL>so</OL>.Yes.Yes. Because I thought that <F>erm</F> I have to go to <F>err</F> ride my mountain bike and I have to <R>go to</R> go to the gym, and I have to <F>err</F> do my exercise, and I always keep my time so.<F>Uhu</F>. But I heard <SC>that they do</SC> that you do so. Because <R>you</R> you exchange everything almost. It was my friend I think, change his <SC>racket</SC> <R>tennis</R> tennis racket. And <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he had a brandnew one even though <R>the</R> the price was <F>err</F> different so.Really? I think I choose the wrong <F>erm</F> shop.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I don't think so because I think <SC>you are a person that</SC> <F>er</F> you're very kind and you are very gentle. <R>So</R> <F>erm</F> so you can change the watch because I only, you know, use for a day so nothing changed.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><F>Um</F></OL>.O K. Thanks a lot.O K. Thanks.Shop service? <F>Erm</F> I think they are not <F>er</F> kind as Japanese shop. <F>Erm</F>. <SC>But</SC> because I think Japanese <F>erm</F> customer service are very <F>err</F> trained and I think they know a lot of <R>pro</R> products, what is this and what the size is. And when I go to, you know, golf shop or go to sports shop, <F>uum</F> they even don't know what size it is, <F>erm</F> because if I bought something in U S size, it's a little bit different because my small is Japanese size.<OL>So</OL> <SC>it does</SC> it's bigger than I expects so, even when I ask I'm Japanese and <R>I</R> I think I'm small and I think it doesn't fit even the size tells that I'm the same size, but <SC>they say</SC> they always say <SC>that's fi</SC> "That's the size.". <SC>and it doesn't se</SC> and "I think you are O K.". But when I try, always <F>er</F> different. So I think <R>they need</R> they need more information for foreigners or<F>er</F> specially <R>who</R> who doesn't have <R>e</R> <F>err</F> enough size <R>for</R> for <SC>they</SC> what <R>they</R> they want <OL>so</OL>.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Uhu</F>.<F>Um</F>.<F>Er</F> you mean, <R>I should</R> I should <F>err</F> tell the story <R>that</R> that happened last week?O K. <F>Er</F> last week, <F>er</F> I went to the station as usual on my way <R>to</R> <F>uum</F> to my office. <F>Er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I usually go</SC> I usually take a train around eight o'clock <F>um</F> <SC>since</SC> because <F>uum</F> <.></.> my work starts at nine, and it takes around an hour or so. And when I went to the platform to take a train, <F>erm</F> the man <R>who st</R> who stand in front of me <R>hit my</R> hit my elbow, and I dropped <R>my</R> my briefcase. And suddenly, my briefcase <F>erm</F> <SC>drop</SC> <F>uum</F> <R>fell</R> fell down my <R>elbow</R> elbows and my arms. And it fell down <R>to the</R> to the lane. <R>And</R> <.></.> and <R>what</R> <R>what</R> what made me angry <R>that</R> <R>that</R> that a man said "What happened because I didn't nothing." but the man hit me, <R>so</R> so that my briefcase <R>fell down</R> fell down the lane. And <R>he</R> <R>he</R> he looks that something happened but <R>he's not</R> he's not serious. So I was very angry with him. <SC>And <R>I</R> I think that rapid train</SC> and after that, <SC>the rapid train</SC> the express train <F>erm</F> passed and <SC>my briefcase wa</SC> I thought my briefcase will be <F>erm</F> crashed, but <SC>wha</SC> <F>um</F> fortunately, <F>um</F> my briefcase was safe. So <SC>I</SC> <F>um</F> inside my briefcase. <SC>It didn't happen</SC> <R>it</R> <R>it</R> it didn't happen anything. And the train officer <F>er</F> kindly <F>err</F> take up my briefcase and gave it to me. So you know, my documents and files and everything was safe, so I was able to <F>uum</F> bring my <F>err</F> briefcase to my office. So that's a good story.<F>Uhu</F>.Today? I think I'll start working again. Because <F>erm</F> I haven't worked for more than four month. So I have to catch up and I have lots of things to do.<OL><F>Err</F></OL>. Yes. <F>Er</F> <SC>today</SC> tonight, I have a meeting. <F>Uum</F> it's not a business meeting <F>erm</F> but I have a dinner with my <SC>president</SC> company president. So <F>err</F> I think <R>I</R> I want ask <R>some</R> something <SC>with him</SC> to him. <SC>Because I</SC> <SC>he's</SC> because he is a new president in our company <OL>so</OL>.I want to ask his strategy in our company, and what he's thinking and what is my main idea.What's gonna happen this year, so.<F>Uhu</F>.O K.
