. Yes. I think his name is Takeshi.
One day last week Takeshi went to restaurant with his father. . And they hardly meet with each other so that there were few chances to to have conversation with each other so that day was a nice day. and they enter in a restaurant. and they sat gave them a menu and they saw menu and they decided and they have a lot of conversation through eating dinner and Takeshi talked his father is about his usual days and they ate a lot of foods and they finished eating.
And his father pay the whole money.
And Takeshi felt good.
 and then his father had to go somewhere so
Takeshi came home by himself.
 my feeling
that day but I have enough money
 to eat expensive foods.
So and my friend also have no money. So we usually eat fast food or in family restaurant
in cheaper food.

 I have class
 from one o'clock so I have to go that lesson.
Yeah. O K.
Thank you.
