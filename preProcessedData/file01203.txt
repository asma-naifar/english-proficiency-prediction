Should I say <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>?<F>Uh</F> not <laughter>really</laughter>. <F>Ur</F><OL>I happen</OL> to be here <F>eh</F> <?>as</?> an exchange researcher.<OL><SC>Because <F>er</F></OL> I got this status</SC> <SC>I do have two</SC> <F>mm</F> at this moment, I have two status. One is <SC>the <F>er</F> being here</SC> being as an exchange researcher between <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> and then in my home university which is <F><?>well</?></F> I <SC>gived you</SC> <SC>give you</SC> given you in my <F>mm</F> <JP>meishi</JP><OL>card</OL>.<F>Erm</F> I hope I could. <F>Um</F> see I wanted to come over <R>to</R> to Japan for longer period of time. I've been, as I told you before, <SC?>to</SC?> over twenty years in Germany. <?>Now I have this</?> <F>mm</F> position at the university, <H pn="school name4">XXX09</H> in <H pn="others4">XXX10</H>. And I want to help in a research <F>ur</F> over <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the Japanese <SC>education</SC> <?>language</?> education and <F>er</F> I applied for this <F>ur</F> taking a leave, <F>ur</F> <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>uh</F> but my position does not have or <SC?>is</SC?> <F>mm</F> cannot be given this sort of sabbatical. So <F>er</F> I do have to <R?>have the</R?> <F>um</F> <?>have the</?> some apply for the <F>er</F> vacation, one-year leave,<OL><SC>on</OL> which I've <F>er</F> did</SC> <F>ah</F> no, <F>mm</F> for which I was quite successful. Because <SC>I have</SC> <R>on</R> on the one hand, I have <SC>the</SC> <F>um</F> applied for the <F>er</F> so-called fellowshipin <F>er</F> Japanese education and <SC>which I</SC> fortunately I could receive one from the <F>er</F> <H pn="others5">XXX11</H>.And <F>oh</F> <SC>this</SC> at the same time, I applied for this exchange researcher program between <F>um</F> <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> and my home <OL>university</OL>.And <F>er</F> again, concerning <R>the</R> the same theme.<OL>Because with</OL> they do have here, this <F>mm</F> Japanese Department, <OL>right</OL>?<F>Er</F> <?>this</?> <SC>Japanese</SC> Department of Japanese Education.<OL><CO>So <??></??></OL> <OL>I've got the two</CO></OL>.Right.Right.<laughter><F>Um</F> not quite</laughter>. <OL><laughter><CO><?>It's a such</?></CO></laughter></OL>.<OL>Right</OL>.<OL>Yes, <??></??></OL>.<OL><F>Ah</F> <SC>it's <?>really</?> twenty</SC></OL>actually <R>i</R> <R>i</R> it's been over almost thirty <OL>years</OL><OL><??></??></OL> because I <??></??>.What changed most? I would <SC>say the</SC> <F>er</F> say, first of all, the appearances of the <F>er</F> younger people and also behavior pattern. <F>Um</F> can you relate to it? <CO>When I say before the</CO>. <OL>Perhaps, right, yes</OL>.<OL>Maybe I should be</OL> more specific. Like <F>erm</F> when left Japan for <?>which as</?> I said <F>er</F> thirty years ago, that was <R>se</R> <SC>seventy</SC> actually seventy-three, so <F>er</F> exactly thirty years ago, right? I went to the States in order to, say, brush up my <R>E</R> English. <F>Mm</F> I wanted to learn. I was a <SC>Ja</SC> English teacher at <F>mm</F> the junior high school. And <F>er</F> <SC>I wanted</SC> I was not satisfied with my proficiency, so <F>er</F> I went to brush up. And I went <R>to th</R> to the States. And <F>er</F> there, I spent <SC>three</SC> four years and then <SC>happened to</SC> it happened that <SC>I</SC> you know, I've been to Germany and I got to know my husband before then, I mean. <F>Um</F> and I went to Germany and it's been over <SC>twenty</SC> <?>say</?> <SC>twenty-s</SC> <SC>twenty-four</SC> twenty-six years. <SC>The</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>the most</SC> <F>ur</F> the biggest different I would say is like <F>er</F> the younger people <SC?>who wouldn't</SC?> <F>um</F> <F>er</F> who can be very <F>mm</F> creative, not all of them, some of them are still sort of uniformed way of thinking and <?><F>well</F></?> appearances. But still the <F>er</F> differences <SC>in terms of the</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> say, <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> how should I describe it, in terms of the <F>er</F> not only appearance but the way they behave. Like <F>er</F> having, you know, <F>mm</F> brown hair or <JP>kinpatsu</JP> <F>mm</F> <SC>as I say</SC> as I've been calling "golden hair" <F>er</F> <SC>the color</SC> the younger people <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>he</SC> color their hairs <F>em</F> which are allowed <R>as</R> <F>er</F> as such.They wouldn't be <SC>san</SC> socially sanctioned, right? And <SC>when I</SC> so this sort of freedom on the one hand in terms of the what they wear, and in terms of the <F>er</F> behavioral pattern, I would say, <F>er</F> people are quite permissive now. Maybe the older generation cannot do anything against it. <CO>It could be <?>as</?> bad, but still</CO>.<F>Em</F>. <OL><??></??> Yeah</OL>.And sort of this traditional way of Japanese patterns which <SC>would be called</SC> can be called as <JP>nihon-jin rashii</JP> <F>er</F> you know, quite typical <?>prototype of</?> Japanese <??></??> <F>er</F> to see in that extent. So I would say this is <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> for me the <SC>most</SC> <F>um</F> yeah, biggest <SC?>problem</SC?> <R>d</R> difference.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.O K.So <F>er</F> <SC>in terms of</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>there's a</SC> <F>uh</F> <R>y</R> you mean <R>the</R> the whole picture <R>or</R> or <OL>what I see</OL>?<SC>It's just like</SC> <F>er</F> this is <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> the drawing concerns <SC>the</SC> probably a <SC>one-room</SC> apartment room for the <SC>lady</SC> young lady <F>er</F> sitting in front of her computer. And <F>er</F> there's one big <F>er</F> window. And she has <F>er</F> probably two pets belong to her, <F>er</F> I guess. One is sleeping <F>hm</F> right next to the bed. And on the bed, <F>er</F> she has a <?>red tiger</?>. <SC>It's <F>um</F> German</SC> in Germany, <SC>I had a</SC> I used to have <SC>the</SC> <SC>some kind of</SC> this <OL>type of</OL> the catwith a long, you know, tail. And she's looking at this two pets and just <F>er</F> quite happy. And actually her <SC>sh</SC> computer is now been <F>hm</F> put on. She has two types of <?>so</?> writing system. <F>Mm</F> interesting. One is the <F>er</F> <F>er</F> typewriter <SC?>in the</SC?> next to <SC>the</SC> her computer. And I can also see at <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the other side of the wall, she has this hi-fi system and underneath some box and calendar on top of it.And the door is open and I imagine that would be about the size of my room <SC?>where</SC?> which I have now <R>in</R> in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.<F>Oh</F> there's one clock <R>which is</R> which is <F>um</F> nine o'clock, so I should describe both of them in the Euclid word, <?>like</?><laughter>describing the time</laughter>. It's probably evening.O K. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Well</F> in terms of this <F>um</F> my <SC>wo</SC> say, <R>working</R> working room so now office below, I don't know what's in English <??></??> they call it, in German you say <??></??> <??></??> room <F>er</F> looks like this exactly<OL>in my room</OL>. <R>I</R> <R>i</R> <SC?>instead</SC?> <R>i</R> <SC>ins</SC> except the fact that I have whole bunch of books <?>belong</?> here <SC>to the</SC> <R>t</R> to the top ceiling.And a cat. I don't have <F>er</F> <F>um</F> dog but I have <R>two cats</R><OL>two cats</OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <R>Sh</R> should Imake a phone call <OL>to you</OL>?<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Ur</F> <F>er</F> hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.

And <F>um</F> you know, just <F>urm</F> <SC>two</SC> when they are playing and <F>er</F> one cat fell off.

And <SC>he want to take</SC> <F>er</F> he has to take his train. It is <F>uh</F> <SC>eight o'clock</SC> eight-five. And it happened that he had <F>er</F> or just because <SC?>his</SC?> <F>mm</F> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> man standing right next to him <SC>sho</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>g</R> <F>mm</F> <R>gave</R> <F>uh</F> <SC?>gave them</SC?> <SC>gave him <F>um</F> the</SC> <F>er</F> was his elbow <F>ur</F> pushed him so that his bag, which was quite important, <F>er</F> fell off <F>mm</F> right on the <F>er</F> rails in between. And it was behind it and he <SC>wanted to hi</SC> <F>ur</F> wanted him to take it, but <R?>wh</R?> <SC?>wh</SC?> <R?>d</R?> <SC?>di</SC?> <SC?>the ner</SC?> the man next to him was quite mean, and he wouldn't take it, right? And then in the meantime, people were around <??></??> <F>mm</F> just watching them and it was quite embarrassing. But nonetheless he wouldn't do it. Now, it happened <R>that</R> that the train came right <?>in it</?>. <F>Er</F> <SC?>it</SC?> this moment, and the <SC>Takagi</SC> Mister Takagi thought, you know, <SC>his <.></.> bag which <??></??> say his <SC>case</SC> <F>huh</F> briefcase</SC>, <?>how do you say, his</?> brief case? His case were beaten and just torn off. But <.></.> he was so relieved <F>well</F> so am I, <F>er</F> because <SC>I</SC> he had in his <F>erm</F> briefcase the whole reports of <R>the</R> <F>er</F> you know, <SC>bu</SC> important business negotiation and he was so relieved. And the <R>man</R> <F>well</F> man next to him was also nice enough <SC>to have this</SC> <F>mm</F> to share this <OL>relief</OL>.And then the <F>er</F> now <F>er</F> it happened that the <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>railroad</SC> <F>er</F> man working at the railroad, <?>how I try to call him</?>, I don't know, <F>er</F> would come up and then, you know, saved this briefcase and handed to him. And he was so relieved. And interestingly enough, <F>er</F> one man <?>who</?> was clapping his hand was different from the man next to him. But I don't know why <SC>they</SC> <R>i</R> <F>er</F> it happen quite often <SC>in Ger</SC> in Japan, and people <R>ww</R> would watch it, but wouldn't <OL>just do or they wouldn't</OL> say anything, right?He could have <F>er</F> call or <SC>the</SC> <R>ca</R> call in the help <F>er</F> because <F>mm</F> actually he was the one who was <F>em</F> responsible for this what happened.<?>And</?> now<?>Everyone's</?> <F>er</F> O K and then, you know, <F>mm</F> but <SC?>they're</SC?> <R?>e</R?> everybody was satisfied and happy.So it was <F>um</F> <?>the</?> happy end.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><?>Welcome</?></OL>.I only have just a small <F>um</F> move from <H pn="others2">XXX05</H> to here.
