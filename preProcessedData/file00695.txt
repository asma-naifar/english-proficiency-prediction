My name is .
.
I'm fine. Thank you.
. , , no. I'm a housewife, and I work part time.
. Actually, I'm teaching English.
. I teach English in the evening.
. I work for English conversation school. And it's one of the biggest schools in Japan. And I teach high school students, college students and business people and housewives. . But I mainly teach adults. . And I only teach students who are in the basic level. . But it is very fun.
.
. the best thing about my job is to meet many people, and I like to communicate with various kinds of people. And I can feel I can help people by teaching English. That's the best thing. And the worst thing is that it takes too long to prepare for each class. . And I'm not paid very , I guess. 
Yeah. It's a fun job, but it takes long time to prepare. . that's the point I don't like about .
. yeah, of course my English is not perfect. So sometimes I'm asked questions that I don't know the answer of the questions. . And sometimes some students have a trouble to communicate with others. So it's sometimes difficult for me to manage the class. My class is quite small, only three four people. . But they are adults. . So it's sometimes very difficult to manage .
 I don't have any particular hobbies. But I like listening to music. . So when I have a free time, I go to a C D rental shop, and rent some C Ds, my favorite songs. And I listen to the music at home. And sometimes I go to karaoke with my friends.
. Yes. I live with my husband, and my husband is very outgoing person. And he likes outdoor activities. So I sometimes go hiking with my husband. And actually, my husband and I climbed Mount Fuji this summer. . It was a great experience for us.
O K. . the place in the suburbs. And there is a house, it's a quite big house. . And let's see, in front of the house, there is a street. And early in the morning. A man is jogging, and some children are playing with a ball. And I see some dogs. And some people are standing and chatting with their friends. . And I see a car in front of the house. And there is a cat on the roof of the car.
Excuse me?
.
. Let me see. I live on the very busy street. And I live in the apartment. . So my place is much more crowded than this place. . And my streets are busier. There are more cars on my streets. . That's the main difference, I think.
 O K.
. Hello, this is . . May I speak to
?
.
I'm so sorry. I couldn't make your party. . And I feel terribly sorry that I couldn't call you yesterday. . I'm really sorry. And actually, my mother called me last night, and she was terribly injured. . she met car accident. . She was O K now, but I had to go to the hospital. So I was so upset last night. . And I had to go to the hospital. So I totally forgot to call you last night. I'm really sorry. . But I was really looking forward to going to your party. So if you have a party next time, would you invite me again?
 I'm really sorry. But it was a emergency, and I had to rush to the hospital. And I was so worried about my mother.
 to tell the truth, I totally forgot about .
.
. Was it?
. That's right. forget that. I'm really sorry. so embarrassed I feel yeah, so sorry. . But I won't let this happen again.
 please forgive me.
Thank you.
. I don't remember, but maybe yes.
 My friends are so nice. So they don't say anything to me. But maybe I missed appointment, or I missed the yeah, engagement. Yes. I think so.
Parties? , yes.
I had a party. that was my friend's friend's wedding party.
. . is this man someone?
Make a story. O K. . One day last week, my friend, Taro, was driving his car. . He was enjoying his drive. And one man was riding his bike. And he was talking on the cell phone while he was driving the motor cycle. . Maybe he was talking with his girlfriend or someone. And that motor cycle hit Taro's car. And the man dropped his cellular phone. . So the man was quite upset. , and he stopped his motor cycle. So Taro stopped his car, too. And they had argument. . The man with the cellular phone was quite upset because his motor cycle was terribly broken. . Let me see. But Taro didn't agree with what the man was saying because Taro thought it was the man's fault because the man was so careless when he was driving his motor cycle. So they decided to call the police. And the police officer came. And Taro explained the situation to the police officer. . He showed the broken cellular phone as an evidence. . . And told the. And so the man driving the motor cycle gave up discussing. And he called the garage. And the man from the garage came. And the man took his broken motor cycle to the garage.
 I have a driver's license, but I don't. 
 I took a driver's license in America when I was living there. And it was easy to drive in America because the road is wide, and yeah, it was easy. But in Japan, it's so scary for me to drive because especially streets in Tokyo are very crowded. . And the traffic rules seem very complicated. .
. They are very dangerous, and they don't have common sense, I guess. Out of question. 
Yes.
. First, you have to realize that there are so many people around you when you are talking on the cell phone. And you have to think about others. . Some people might be annoyed by your cell phone. . So you have to think about people.
. I'll go home. And maybe I take a nap for a while. And then I have to work in the evening tonight. . So I'll prepare for the classes.
That's right.
.
