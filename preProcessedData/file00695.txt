And <F>ur</F> it's <F>ur</F> one of the biggest schools in Japan. And <F>ur</F> I teach <F>mm</F> high school students, college students and business people and housewives. <F>Mm</F>. But I mainly teach adults. <F>Mm</F>. And I only teach <F>ur</F> students who are in the basic level. <F>Mm</F>. But it is very fun.<F>Mm</F>.<F>Urr</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>mm</F> <F>ur</F> the best thing about my job is <F>ur</F> to meet many people, and <F>ur</F> I like to communicate with various kinds of people. And <R>I</R> I can feel I can help people <F>ur</F> by teaching English. That's the best thing. And the worst thing is <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> that it takes too long to prepare for each class. <F>Mm</F>. And I'm not paid very <F>well</F>, I guess. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah. It's a fun job, but <F>ur</F> it takes long time to prepare. <F>Mm</F>. <R>That's the</R> <F>mm</F> that's the point I don't like about <OL>my job</OL>.<F>Urm</F>. <F>Well</F> yeah, of course my English is not perfect. So sometimes <SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> I'm asked questions <F>ur</F> that I don't know the answer of the questions. <F>Mm</F>. And sometimes some students have <F>urm</F> a trouble to communicate with others. So it's sometimes difficult for me <R>to</R> <F>mm</F> to manage the class. My class is <F>urm</F> quite small, <SC>only four</SC> only three <?>of</?> four people. <F>Mm</F>. But they are adults. <F>Mm</F>.

But <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> I like listening to music. <F>Ur</F>. So when I have a free time, I go to a <SC>vi</SC> <F>ur</F> C D rental shop, and rent some C Ds, my favorite songs. And I listen to <F>ur</F> the music at home. And sometimes I go to karaoke with my friends.<F>Ur</F>. Yes. I live with my husband, and my husband is very <F>um</F> outgoing person.

I think so.Parties? <F>Urrr</F> <F>uhh</F> <R>yes</R>, yes.I had a party. <F>Urm</F> that was my <F>ur</F> friend's friend's <F>ur</F> wedding party.<F>Mmm</F>. <..></..> O K. <F>Ur</F>. <SC>One day la</SC> <R>i</R> <R>i</R> is this man someone?Make a story. O K. <F>Ur</F>. One day last week, <F>ur</F> my friend, Taro, was driving his car. <F>Ur</F>. He was enjoying his drive. And <F>urm</F> <.></.> O K, <F>ur</F> one man was <R>riding</R> riding his bike. And he was <F>ur</F> talking on the cell phone while <R>he was driving</R> he was driving the <SC>bike</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>motor cycle</R> motor cycle. <F>Ur</F>. Maybe he was talking <SC>with her</SC> with his girlfriend or someone. And <F>mm</F> that motor cycle <F>ur</F> hit <.></.> <F>urm</F> Taro's car. And the man dropped his cellular phone. <F>Mm</F>. So <F>ur</F> the man was quite upset. <R>And he stopped his motor cycle</R>, and <F>ur</F> he stopped his motor cycle. So Taro stopped his car, too. And they had <F>ur</F> argument. <F>Mm</F> <F>ur</F>. The man with the cellular phone was quite upset because his motor cycle was terribly broken. <F>Mm</F>. Let me see. But <F>ur</F> Taro <F>urm</F> didn't agree with what the man was saying because Taro thought <SC>it was his fault</SC> it was the man's fault because <F>ur</F> the man <F>ur</F> was so careless when he was driving his motor cycle. So <F>ur</F> they decided to <F>ur</F> call the police. And the police officer came. And Taro explained the situation to the police officer. <F>Ur</F>. He showed the <SC>s</SC> broken cellular phone <F>ur</F> as an <SC>envidence</SC> <R>evi</R> evidence. <F>Mm</F>. <F>Ur</F>. And <SC>he <F>ur</F> told the</SC> Taro told the police officer that the accident was the man with the cellular phone's fault. <F>Mm</F>. And <F>ur</F> so <F>ur</F> <SC>the man with the cellular phone</SC> the man driving the motor cycle <F>ur</F> gave up discussing. And he called the garage. And the man from the garage came. And <SC>the</SC> <SC>he</SC> the man <F>ur</F> took his broken motor cycle to the garage.<F>Urm</F> I have a driver's license, but I don't. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F> I took a driver's license in America when I was living there. And it was easy to drive in America because <SC>the land is so wide</SC> <R>the road is wi</R> the road is wide, and <F>urm</F> <SC>it</SC> yeah, it was easy. But in Japan, <F>ur</F> it's so scary for me to drive because <F>ur</F> especially streets <F>ur</F> in Tokyo are very crowded. <F>Mm</F>. And the traffic rules seem <F>ur</F> very complicated. <OL><F>Mm</F></OL>.<F>Oh</F>. They are very dangerous, and they don't have <F>ur</F> common sense, I guess. <F>Mm</F> Out of question. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.<F>Mmm</F>. First, <F>ur</F> you have to realize that there are so many people around you when you are talking on the cell phone. And <R>you have to</R> <F>ur</F> you have to think about others. <F>Ur</F>. Some people might <F>ur</F> be <SC>annoyed by you</SC> <F>ur</F> annoyed by your cell phone. <F>Mm</F>. So you have to think about people.<F>Ur</F>. <SC>I go home</SC> I'll go home. And <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> maybe I take a nap <nvs>laughter</nvs> for a while. And then I have to work in the evening tonight. <F>Mm</F>. So <F>ur</F> I'll prepare for the classes.That's right.<OL>Thank you</OL>.
