So, I will tell you about this story. . One day last week,  the woman went to  store  to buy  the present for her husband. . . And     she had a good idea.   so          how can I say,  sorry,  she bought a tie   for her husband   after  she discussed  with the employee. So after that,   she paid  some money  to get  neck tie for him.        sorry, although   she wanted to buy the present for him,    she found out  final sale.  So,   she looked around  final sale   by herself.      fortunately,     there was  her favorite  clothes  in the   sale bargain . So, she bought      red shirts on herself. After that,  she went outside  with her many bags. That's all.
.

 because   today is casual Friday in .
Sure.
 Today,   I don't need to  see with customer.
So,  I am wearing casual shirts
to relax.

 this weekend
. Yes, two days.

Honestly,  I want to go outside  with my friends on weekdays.
