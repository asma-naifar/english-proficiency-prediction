Ready. <OL><?>I'm</?> ready</OL>.<F>Erm</F> I want to go to <F>ner</F> New York City. And <F>ner</F> so I'd like <?>to</?> know the information about <F>ner</F> how to get <R>that</R> that place.<SC>So and</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> so, how much does it cost to the New York City?Twenty dollars? Is that <F>ner</F> one-way?<F>Uh-huh</F> thank you very much.<F>Ah</F> I need <F>er</F> of course, ticket.<OL><R>The</R></OL> <SC>the</SC> <.></.> this is twenty dollars.Thank you.Thank you very much.No, never.But <F>ner</F> I want to go there.<F>Err</F> when I was a <F>er</F> university student, I went to <F>ner</F> Seattle.<SC>Seattle is <F>ner</F> east part of the States, so I have never been to</SC> <F>ner</F> <F>err</F> <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> west part of the <OL>States, Seattle is</OL>,so I have never but been to east part of the States. So I want to there.Because <F>ner</F> there is much difference especially in their culture and <F>er</F> way of thinking,I think.<OL>Difference</OL>?<F>Err</F> just my opinion.<OL><?>But</?></OL> <F>um</F> <F>er</F> western area is, I think, <R?>there</R?> there is more open mind.For example,<F>er</F> <R>when they</R> <F>ner</F> <SC>when they met stranger, but</SC> <F>er</F> <R>when</R> <F>er</F> when <F>ner</F> people walk along each other, <.></.> <F>er</F> but they don't know, but <R>they</R> they usually <F>ner</F> <R>say</R> say "Hello." or "How's everything going?".So I think that is <F>ner</F> kind of <F>er</F> open-mind spirit <?>for</?> mind. But and <F>er</F> I think <F>er</F> east area is more conservative.I think.Because <F>er</F> <F>err</F> eastern area <SC>is</SC> <F>er</F> has more history.So <SC>they ge</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>Europe</SC> first of <F>ner</F> all, <laughter>European</laughter> people came <F>er</F> <F>er</F> east area. And <F>er</F> so I think <F>err</F> that area is more <F>ner</F> conservative than <F>er</F> east area. That's my opinion.You're welcome.<R>So</R> <F>ah</F> <F>ner</F> so <F>ah</F> <F>ner</F> I have to describe the story of this picture? <OL>Is that what you mean</OL>?<laughter>All right</laughter>. <F>Err</F> O K.
