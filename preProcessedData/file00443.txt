Describe it?
. 
There is  many people playing around a house. Two boys playing ball. And   this old man is now  reading newspaper on the chair. And I think   this is  on Sunday because  they don't  go to school. And  this is very sunny day. And   that's it.
O K?
This area?
  I don't have much .
Because I don't care.  I don't have much interest .
O K?
.
Live?
To me? Myself?
I live in  north part of   City.
You know  City?
Neighborhood. My neighborhood?
 my neighborhood. I don't have much knowledge about my neighborhood. But  my next living neighborhood is   just move. And  recently, they built their house.
  so there are  newcomer.   they also worked for the   trading business company.
O K. Ready. .
 I want to go to  New York City. And  so I'd like  know the information about  how to get  that place.
   so, how much does it cost to the New York City?
Twenty dollars? Is that  one-way?
 thank you very much.
 I need  of course, ticket.
   this is twenty dollars.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
No, never.
But  I want to go there.
 when I was a  university student, I went to  Seattle.
     west part of the ,
so I have never but been to east part of the States. So I want to there.
Because  there is much difference especially in their culture and  way of thinking,
I think.
?
 just my opinion.
   western area is, I think,  there is more open mind.
For example,
       when  people walk along each other,   but they don't know, but  they usually   say "Hello." or "How's everything going?".
So I think that is  kind of  open-mind spirit  mind. But and  I think  east area is more conservative.
I think.
Because   eastern area   has more history.
So    first of  all,  people came   east area. And  so I think  that area is more  conservative than  east area. That's my opinion.
You're welcome.
   so   I have to describe the story of this picture? ?
.  O K. Here I go.
  in the morning, one    walked to  station as usual. But        when he  at a platform, he  happened to drop his bag. .     . May I    return second one?
?  when he arrive at platform,    next passenger     stick   his hand so he dropped his bag in a  railroad. So  the  angry and      he claimed to next passenger.  Then suddenly   the train    suddenly came  platform.  so    this    was very  upset because  his bag was  clashed by train.  lucky  after all,   station officer  came and  he  picked the bag for him.       that's it.
O K?
 I come to office by  train.
.
The difference?
And  I think  the difference is  train is usually on time coming, no late. Sometime late but usually no late. But    compare with  train,  car is  there is  the traffic jam. . . That's it.
.
After the interview?
So  I have to call my boss. And  so there is  next day, tomorrow I have  a exhibition
 of my company.
So  I have to call my boss and    I have to talk with him. .
Get home?
 I think it's about    eleven o'clock.
No. 
Yeah. I'm hungry.

O K.
