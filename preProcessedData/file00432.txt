  and     I angried to the gentleman.   and  I   asked he to   go down the rail and  bring up my bag  himself. But    
   he didn't agree it. And   next time,         express  came into the station and     went through on  my bag.
I thought   the bag was  broken.
  after that  express,  my bag was no problem, because  there is my bag  between the rails.
  And      I looked for station staff, and  I asked also  him to  bring up my bag, and he agreed it.    he  bring up my bag. The end.
