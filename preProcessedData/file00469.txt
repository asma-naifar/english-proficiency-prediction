I'm planning to go to Harajuku to get <F>um</F> some baby clothes for my friend.My friend? <F>Erm</F> <F>er</F>. <SC>She is</SC> <F>um</F> she has worked in America for ten years. <SC>And</SC> so <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>um</F> she is a bilingual and bicultural, and I like <?>talk with</?> her. I think we have a lot in common.<F>Um</F>. Yes, I have lived in the States for one year <R>and</R> and three month.<F>Um</F>. <.></.> <F>Oh</F>. For the first time I was in the States <F>erm</F> I was an exchange student in high school. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> I lived with a nice American family. <R>I had</R> I had a nice <F>um</F> experience with them. And I learned a lot about <F>erm</F> how American family cooperate with each other. <R>And</R> <F>um</F> <.></.> and <F>er</F> also, last time, <R>I</R> I worked in <H pn="company name1">XXX03</H> for three month. But I came back <laughter>for some reason</laughter>. <F>Erm</F>. So, was great that I could experience working in the States. <F>Um</F>. But, unfortunately, the company was a branch of <H pn="company name2">XXX04</H>, so it was <F>erm</F> like a traditional Japanese <laughter>company</laughter>. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>. So I found myself in the same situation that <F>um</F> while I was, <SC>in</SC> you know, in <H pn="others1">XXX05</H>. <F>Um</F>. <SC>So</SC> <F>ah</F> and, during that time, <?>U C A</?> offered me a job. <SC>I had</SC> but I <SC>have</SC> had to return to Japan with the promise that I can work again in the States. So my goal to return to the U S in the future.<F>Err</F>. It's a fine day. <F>Um</F>. <.></.> <F>Err</F>. <.></.> <F>Uum</F>. There is <SC>a big house</SC> one big house.

And one man is jogging along the street.Yes.<F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>. <.></.> I think, <F>um</F> basically, it can't be helped because we have small land. <F>Um</F>. <R>But</R> but, still, <SC>we have</SC> we got <.></.> some land <R>in</R> in countryside. But the problem is that <F>um</F> you cannot have <SC>a job but</SC> <F>um</F> the job like mine related to computers. <F>Um</F>. So <.></.> <SC>if we have</SC> <SC>if we</SC> <.></.> <F>um</F> <??></??> <F>hmm</F> <.></.> a lot of companies should move to countryside. Then, young people can have jobs there, and <SC>have a</SC> <F>um</F> <F>uh</F> we will be able to have bigger houses. <F>Hm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Well</F>.<.></.> <??></??>?O K.Hello?

Suddenly, it started raining. <R>An</R> and the tent and the <.></.> <F>er</F> pans and stuff are blown away by the strong wind.

And also, <F>um</F> <.></.> <?>I</?> went down the Grand Canyon, <F>urn</F> took about <F>hm</F> two days. <SC>And I</SC> and my host mother stayed <F>er</F> in a valley. And we set up a tent there. <SC>And</SC> <SC>so</SC> <.></.> <F>huh</F> but, <laughter>on the way back</laughter>, <F>um</F> I was very scared because my hands were trembling from too much walking. <OL>That was <?>scary</?></OL>.O K.Yes.Tonight? <F>Well</F>.
