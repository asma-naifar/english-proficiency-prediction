Yes. My name is .
Nice to meet you.
. I'm pretty good, thank you. How are you?
. Yes. I'm busy days.
 work.
. I'm in technical support.
 . I get many issues from my clients everyday, and I open issues and talk to the U S technicians by E-mail or databases to solve the problems.
Sorry?
 . my client say they appreciate me about helping them with the issues. . I feel pretty happy.
 . I'm planning to go to Harajuku to get some baby clothes for my friend.
My friend? . she has worked in America for ten years. so she is a bilingual and bicultural, and I like her. I think we have a lot in common.
. Yes, I have lived in the States for one year and three month.
. . For the first time I was in the States I was an exchange student in high school. And I lived with a nice American family. I had a nice experience with them. And I learned a lot about how American family cooperate with each other. also, last time, I worked in for three month. But I came back . . So, was great that I could experience working in the States. . But, unfortunately, the company was a branch of , so it was like a traditional Japanese . . So I found myself in the same situation that while I was, you know, in . . and, during that time, offered me a job. but I had to return to Japan with the promise that I can work again in the States. So my goal to return to the U S in the future.
. It's a fine day. . . . There is one big house. And the car is parked in front of the house. And I see a guy who is just reading a newspaper in front of the big house. . . . I forgot what you call this. . And I see two dogs playing with a ball. And one man is jogging along the street.
Yes.
 . basically, it can't be helped because we have small land. . but, still, we got in countryside. But the problem is that you cannot have the job like mine related to computers. . So we will be able to have bigger houses. . 
.

O K.
 I think there is one more thing I can do. quit maybe, I can go to the party and have a nice time with them and come back to the office late at night.
Yeah.
Yes, I know that. .
. Yes. I think it's very true.
. Because I'm a workaholic. I can't leave the office early because people around me all stay until late at night. . Maybe, the point is that comfortable they don't have comfortable place to take a rest at their homes. 
 . . . They just stay in the office so that they feel comfortable. But this is not true though. 

O K. .
. There are two girls .
. One day last week, two girls decided to go to a mountain I mean, for camping. and they packed the things for camping. And then, when they arrived, they set up the tent and started cooking. Suddenly, it started raining. and the tent and the pans and stuff are blown away by the strong wind. So, unfortunately, they had to leave the place to go to a hotel instead. And they went to a lounge. They a cup of tea. And they decided to stay there until rain stops.
Yes. camping.
. Grand Canyon. And there was a nice camping ground. And we set up the tent just like them in the picture, and we we cooked it with the charcoal. . It was very good. And also, went down the Grand Canyon, took about two days. and my host mother stayed in a valley. And we set up a tent there. but, , I was very scared because my hands were trembling from too much walking. .
O K.
Yes.
Tonight? . I'm planning to finish it by six o'clock.
Because this is Friday.
