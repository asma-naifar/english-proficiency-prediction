.
.
Sorry.      shall I make up the story of this?
Based on it?
About this picture. . .
.
O K. I understand. . One day last week,      a lady  was thinking of the birthday present  for her husband. And she went to the department store. And she was looking for a nice gift for him. And so  she realized that  her husband tend to use      very old ties.
And  he doesn't have very new and fashionable tie. So   she made mind to buy a new, very stylish neckties for him. . So     she could find fortunately a nice one. And she bought it there. . But  after that,  when she came across the  shoes  corner,   she realize that  there was a bargain sale,  something like thirty percent off. That is quite  attractive price. So  she suddenly made mind to buy one for herself. . After that, another floor,    next one is fifty percent which is clothes. And   she made another decision  to buy one there.  actually and finally,  when  she gets out the department store, she was holding a full of  shoes, clothes.    and her  husband present.
.
. My wife.
Exchange? . Yes. Normally, yes.
Yeah.
.  question. . My birthday is November. Last year,  yes,  it's not material but I requested to go  nice restaurant. And   I asked particularly on that special day, to have  expensive wine.
  not very expensive.  less than ten thousand yen.  but  quite  expensive  for my . And so then I enjoyed   wine and nice food. And that's was my last   birthday present.
To?
.   I normally ask directly   what  is her intention.
. So  something like "How about this year?", " what do you like?" or something like that.

. . Say, I think   if it's very expensive like a diamond ring,
  "Let me see the opportunity if I can buy someday, say five year's time. But this year,   please   take my apology. And so  accept   smaller one or cheaper one. But I will promise  some day," or something like that.

.
Yes.

 after this. . I have a appointment for the meeting or something.
Yeah.
.
.
. .
Yeah. Thank you very much.
