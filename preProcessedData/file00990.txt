So <R>sh</R> <R>she could find</R> <F>em</F> <F>er</F> she could find fortunately a nice one. And she bought it there. <F>Er</F>. But <F>er</F> after that, <F>er</F> when she came across the <F>er</F> shoes <F>er</F> corner, <.></.> <F>er</F> she realize that <R>there</R> there was a bargain sale, <F>er</F> something like thirty percent off. That is quite <F>er</F> attractive price. So <F>er</F> she suddenly made mind to buy one for herself. <F>Er</F>. After that, another floor, <F>eh</F> <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> next one is fifty percent which is clothes.
