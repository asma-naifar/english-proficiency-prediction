"One day last week"?

. .
 One day last week,  I drove a car  in my  hometown.  And  a  bike   came     to opposite side  and had a car accident. 
  a man who ride on a bike  told me that  I was wrong  and he insisted me to  give him a money to repair his bike. . I couldn't  tell what he says so I called a policeman and     I explained     what was the situation like.  and  I insisted too  strong   so  a man who  rode a bike   gave me . 
.
? Correct procedure?  . .
What to do?  at first, if  there is a person who  injured   go to a hospital at once. And  if there is no person who injured,  call up a policeman    as it is. And   a policeman will  tell what to do at the place.   
it is not my business. And after   talking to policeman,   I asked my customer to call me again. And   I ask the situation of  the accident again, and   it's .    what to do at first is  call a policeman.
