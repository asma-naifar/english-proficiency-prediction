But I like watching <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> T V shows that like <F>ur</F> artists come and they sing. <F>Ur</F> like Music Station, I think, that's what they call it. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah, I like those because I like listening to music.No, because it's too expensive in Japan. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ur</F> I went to one of them. I went to Britney Spears <laughter><??></??></laughter>.<F>Urm</F> it was fun. <SC>It was a lot of</SC> there were <F>um</F> a lot of people. And I think the concert was two hours.Yeah. It was fun. I went with my little sister. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Urm</F> I have a sister who's now fourteen.And <F>urm</F> she lives back in the States with my family. I'm just here with my <R>real</R> real dad. And she lives with <SC>my mo</SC> <F>mm</F> my real mom and my step father.So right now, <SC>I'm a</SC> I'm far away from her butwe talk on the phone.

And a guy fell <nvs>laughter</nvs> off his ski.<F>Urm</F> on the left, children are throwing snowballs at each other and having fun. And some people made a snow man.And few people are in a rest house. And I think they're drinking coffee or <SC>something</SC> something warm. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F> more? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> there's bunch of trees and there is a mountain and the <SC>cloud's blue</SC> sky is blue. <F>Urm</F>.<laughter>O K</laughter>.I ski.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I went skiing on the Rocky Mountains.And <R>this</R> <R>this</R> this skiing place looks kinda small to the one that I went. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urm</F> but <SC>it</SC> <SC>I guess it</SC> they're having fun so I guess it's a good skiing place <nvs>laughter</nvs> to go to. <F>Urm</F> I see all the people skiing here but when I went, <SC>I saw</SC> <F>ur</F> like mostly the people I saw were snowboarding.So that's one of the difference. <nvs>laughter</nvs>And <F>oh</F> where I went, they didn't have snow fights. If they did, they probably got in trouble because <SC>that's not</SC> you're not supposed to do that on the <R>ski</R><OL>skiing</OL> place. Yeah.So <R>I didn't see</R> I didn't see any children playing that.I <laughter>tried</laughter> snowboarding but I didn't do <F>well</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>I fell and so, no.

But when I did that, like some people got in a fight with each other.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Because <R>a</R> <R>a</R> I didn't know but I guess they didn't like each other or something that they started giving each other looks and they just got in the fight and I couldn't do <laughter>anything</laughter> about it. <CO>Because they were both of my friends <SC>but</SC> so</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>No, my mom did. <nvs>laughter</nvs><SC?>Me</SC?> <F>oh</F> my mom did mostly,but <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I helped <laughter>her</laughter> a little bit. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes. <F>Urm</F> most interesting? <.></.> <F>Urm</F> I don't know. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Ur</F> <F>oh</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>um</F> I went to a Halloween party and <F>uh</F> it was my first time going in the States <F>ur</F> to a <SC>fa</SC> Halloween party. And <F>ur</F> it was fun because we were all wearing costumes and <F>ur</F> we ate a lot of food. And the girl that I went <F>ur</F> her house, <SC>they made</SC> I think it was a dining room, they made that room into like a dance room.So it was all dark and they had a light. <F>Urm</F> and <R>they had</R> they had like all different types of music playing. And yeah, it was fun. <nvs>laughter</nvs><nvs>cough</nvs><F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Ur</F> can this person be me?O K. One day last week, I was walking to the station because I had to go to work. It was eight o'clock and since it was so early in the morning, there were so many people and it was very crowded. <SC>I was waiting for the train to come</SC>. And wait, I was waiting for the train to come and so I was behind a man who was lining up before me. <F>Well</F> he was talking to another person and he didn't know that I was behind him. So he lifted his arm quite hard and fast that the luggage that I was holding, it fell off to the <SC>tra</SC> wait, <R>t</R> <R>trail</R> trail, <F>oh</F> man, I forgot what this is called.<F>Ur</F> it fell. <F>Urm</F> I got so angry and start yelling at the man. But the man just said, "I don't know.". And raised his hands. <F>Well</F> ten seconds later, the train came and it ran over my or I thought it ran over my luggage. But thank God, it didn't. And it was just lying there like it was before the train got there. <nvs>cough</nvs> I called the train man and told him what happened. And when I told him, he picked it up for me and <SC>gave it</SC> gave me the luggage. Everybody was happy and so was I.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><nvs>cough</nvs><SC>I will go up to <R>the</R> <F>ur</F> the</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I will go up <R>to</R> to the man that works at the train station.And ask him what I should do because I lost something.Yeah.<F>Mm</F> yes, ma'am.<F>Well</F> I once saw two guys fighting on the train. And like a month ago, I lost my pass <SC>to the</SC> <laughter>to this</laughter> schoolon the train. And I thought someone stole it, butI found out that <SC>I</SC> <F>urm</F> like it fell on the train.And so when I when I went to the train station to see if I lost it, they had it. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> I got it back.<R>A</R> I was very thankful. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I lived in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> so we didn't have trains.So <SC>they</SC> most of the time, car was our transportation. And to get to school, <SC>it was</SC> <SC>it</SC> <R>I</R> I took the bus. But other friends, like since they're already able to drive, yeah, they drove to school.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Well</F> since I don't like the trains, I prefer the one in States. Like I like cars so I prefer cars. But trains are really, they are very <F>um</F> useful.Because <F>well</F> <R>I did</R> I didn't have a driver's license so when I lived in the States, if my family was sick, then I couldn't go anywhere. But here, although like your parents are sick, you can just take the train and meet your friends.So yeah, <SC>there</SC> <R>I</R> I guess if I have to choose, then a car. But <F>ur</F> I like the both. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Yes</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>But <SC>you have to be able</SC> you have to be eighteen, <R>I</R> I think, to drive. And it's expensive here soI <laughter>don't know</laughter>.O K.After this interview? <F>Urm</F> I'm going home. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Uh-huh</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I'm going home and eat dinner. <nvs>laughter</nvs>And study. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Thank you.<nvs>laughter</nvs>
