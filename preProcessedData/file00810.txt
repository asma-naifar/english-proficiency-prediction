I went many, many place like <.></.> <R>Mexico</R>Mexico, Australia, Micronesian islands, Philippines, Malaysia, Red Sea. Many, many place.<F>Um</F>. It was <R>so</R> so fantastic <R>to</R> to go around many, many place all over the world with diving. <F>Um</F> I mean, <F>um</F> when I went for diving <SC>with</SC> <R>on</R> <R>on boat</R> on boat trip, <F>um</F> <SC>we</SC> <R>I</R> I could make friends with many people,<OL>in the world</OL>. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Uum</F>. How can I say, <F>um</F> <R>I can</R> I can experience the things which I can't <SC>explain</SC> <F>eh</F> experience in such real world, like <F>um</F> how can I say, have you ever been <F>er</F> to <SC?>things</SC?> diving?Never? <F>Um</F>.<F>Um</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uum</F>. How can I say, <F>um</F> <SC>there is no</SC> <R>we</R> we don't feel gravity under water because we have some, how can I say, <R>air</R> air jacket under water.

This teacher <F>um</F> <SC>teaching</SC> is teaching mathematics now. And <SC>many students</SC> some of students listening carefully, but some of them <SC>doesn't liste</SC> <F>er</F> don't listen to her. And these two girls are just chatting. And this boy is looking outside. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>he is</R> he is listening his music by himself and <R>drink</R> drinking some drink. And just two, this one girl and one boy are listening to the teacher. But teacher <SC>does seems not</SC> <F>ee</F> doesn't seem to care about all of them.Yes. <laughter>Definitely</laughter>.<OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Uum</F>. I think it's very similar to this.It was very similar to this. Because <R>my</R> <R>my</R> my <SC>high school</SC> junior high school <SC>was</SC> had <F>er</F> very <F>er</F> free atmosphere.We can do everything we like.And <SC>teacher doesn't <F>uum</F> always ca</SC> <SC>teacher does</SC> <F>er</F> teacher <SC>don't kept</SC> <F>er</F> don't keep on <.></.> asking us to do this or just to do it or something like that. We can do <R>every</R> everything <.></.> <SC>I</SC> we like. And <R>I was a</R> I was a very good student.So <nvs>laughter</nvs> I always <R>listen to</R> <F>um</F> listen to the class very, very carefully. I never fall asleep during the classroom. But some of my friends just chatting <F>eh</F> <SC>at the class</SC> <F>ee</F> in the classroom. And <R>some of</R> some of them <SC>was fall asleep</SC> <R>f</R> fell asleep. <F>Um</F>.I think <R>it's</R> it's very similar. <F>Hm</F>.<F>Err</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>. Because I think one reason is <SC>my parents are</SC> both of my parents are professor of university,so <R>my</R> <R>my</R> <SC>my ha</SC> <R>my</R> my family was so strict to me. And they always said me that <R>you should</R> you should study very, very hard.Very, very hard. So that is one reason. <R>And</R> <.></.> <R>and</R> <R>and</R> and the other reason is, <SC>I think <F>um</F> my school had such free atmosphere so they didn't</SC> <F>err</F> how can I say, <.></.> I think there is some case that if I was a good student, my friends <R>will</R> will become dislike me or my friends will feel I'm a bit different from them, and <SC>they wanna</SC> they didn't wanna make friends with me. But <F>ee</F> <F>mm</F> <R>in my</R> in my <F>um</F> school, there is no atmosphere like that.<OL>So I can</OL> made friends with everyone. <F>Um</F>.<OL><F>Um</F></OL>. <F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.Yes.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uum</F>.

Or <R>I don't</R> <R>I don't have</R> <F>err</F> I don't <R>have</R> <F>um</F> have party <R>in my</R> in my apartment or something. Because my apartment is very, very small to invite my friends.
