.
 my name is , .
 nice to meet you.
. I'm just coming back form Europe.
And I'm a bit tired now.
.
 at Narita this morning.
 a bit sleepy now.
.
. I just went there just for sightseeing,
 for five days total. .
. 
.
 I went to in Paris.
And I met with my friends there. And he speaks French. And it was very nice. Because I went there maybe three month ago by myself but at the time, I just only spoke in English. But French people were not so kind us this time. So it was so nice to have some communication with them in French. .
Exciting.
.
 they are not nice. But I don't know. . If we speak in French, they always speak with some smile.
 when I ordered like in English, they just say, like "Oui" or something and just put some coffee, that's it. . .
.
.
 no. Because yes, when I went there three month ago, I went shopping and I bought many, many things like two pairs of shoes and one handbag and those this time, I decided not to go shopping before I went there. Because the purpose for visiting Paris this time was to meet with my friends
there.
So I didn't went for shopping like some handbag or something.
Just went there and spend time with them and feel Paris' atmosphere.
.
 . 
 this is the tell you I wanna tell you but this is the company's test. .

I'm so sorry about that, . 
 .
Free time?
. I love to play tennis,
or when I have some short holiday,
some five days or something, I love to go diving .
But recently, I went many, many place all over the world,
and I haven't go diving recently.
. Maybe half a year or something. .
But I love diving. I went many, many place like 
Mexico, Australia, Micronesian islands, Philippines, Malaysia, Red Sea. Many, many place.
. It was so fantastic to go around many, many place all over the world with diving. I mean, when I went for diving on boat trip, I could make friends with many people,
. .
. How can I say, I can experience the things which I can't experience in such real world, like how can I say, have you ever been to diving?
Never? .
. 
. How can I say, we don't feel gravity under water because we have some, how can I say, air jacket under water. So the tank itself is really heavy so very strange or so unnatural feeling. And there is just blue world.
 all things is blue.
And there are many, many fishes, corals. so fantastic. I love fishes, corals. .

Yes, please.

Yes. . This teacher is teaching mathematics now. And some of students listening carefully, but some of them don't listen to her. And these two girls are just chatting. And this boy is looking outside. And he is listening his music by himself and drinking some drink. And just two, this one girl and one boy are listening to the teacher. But teacher doesn't seem to care about all of them.
Yes. .
.
. I think it's very similar to this.
It was very similar to this. Because my junior high school had very free atmosphere.
We can do everything we like.
And always ca teacher don't keep on everything we like. And I was a very good student.
So I always listen to the class very, very carefully. I never fall asleep during the classroom. But some of my friends just chatting in the classroom. And some of them fell asleep. .
I think it's very similar. .
 . Because I think one reason is both of my parents are professor of university,
so my family was so strict to me. And they always said me that you should study very, very hard.
Very, very hard. So that is one reason. and the other reason is, my school had such free atmosphere so they didn't how can I say, will become dislike me or my friends will feel I'm a bit different from them, and they didn't wanna make friends with me. But in my school, there is no atmosphere like that.
 made friends with everyone. .
.
.
Yes.

. Just a moment, .
. 
.
O K.
. ?
Hello. I'm .
 I'm really sorry not to be there. . I'm just in my hometown, Nara. we are in Tokyo now. And Nara is very far from Tokyo.
And it's my hometown.
And I had a phone call from my mother and my father was in hospital,
because of some accidents. So I had to go back to my hometown at once. So I couldn't call you. So I'm really sorry about not to go to your party. I was really wanted to go there. But I couldn't because of my father's sickness. .
 ?
Really? What kind of surprise party was it?
 really I'm really sorry about that. please, please, please let me know if you have some party later on. So,
 join you again. .
.

 just please, please keep it for two days or three days. I will definitely call you when I go back to Tokyo.
 please, please just keep it. I will definitely go to your home as soon as I go back Tokyo. so just keep it for a while, please.
.

Just squeeze the gifts and sleep well. 
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
Bye-bye.
.
Yes. Yes. . Actually, my friend like to have party.
And she always ask me to join them.
So sometimes I went to the parties .
. I'm not used to have party,
 by myself. Or I don't have party in my apartment or something. Because my apartment is very, very small to invite my friends. So I don't have any space to have it. Or I think Japanese people doesn't used to have party compared to the people outside Japan.
But my friend has many, many friends from abroad, so how can I say, she is very good at having party.
And the friend of hers have very, very fantastic apartment cities in the center of Tokyo.
 it is very nice. I was so surprised when I go there. do you know Shirogane?
 I think Shirogane is very, very 
high-class town.
And she has very big apartment there. And we can see even Tokyo Tower from her room. so nice.
 , yes.
Yes.
.
Yes.
O K. One day, he drove his car. And somebody else was riding on motorbike. And he was speaking with his girlfriend on the mobile phone,
 in spite of he is riding motorbike. then the car hit the mobile phone of the person who is riding motorbike.
 got angry and the no, the car hit the motorbike itself. And he throw away his mobile phone. And he gets angry about the mobile phone and motorbike. And the person who drove a car was listening to him. Then the policeman came to them and some person who drive a truck came here. the broken motorbike and he put on the motorbike on the truck,
and went somewhere.
. Basically, I don't like that because it sometimes annoys me to talk on the mobile phone is sometimes rude. in public space there is but actually I think sometimes I also talk on the mobile phone even if it is public space. So I also understand the feeling of the person who's speaking on the mobile phone at the public space.
.

.
.
Today, you mean?
. I have to go back to my desk. And now, I'm just waiting for the research results,
 a month or something. So this is just the time I don't have a lot of things to do.
 I have some free time But I have to prepare some documents, I think, by the end of this year, so I have to work on the documents. So I had to look over some research results so far.
And I had to write some documents.
. .
Yes. 
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
