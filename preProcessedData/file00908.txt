It's very exciting, but as you guess, I'm very busy for studying and   working. Now I save  my time for working because I have many assignment and examination from my grads school. However, I work with two staff members in my office. So  I should use some times for the office for  two member.

  I think my hobby is speaking English.
I really like to speak at English. .
  Every Japanese student  have studied English for many years when they were in  junior school. As you aware Japanese English level is still low. So  it's same for me. After I graduate university,  I've been continuing  lessen for conversation in English.  But I feel it is not easy to express my opinion in English still now. But fun.
Of course, to speak in foreign language, I think it is to know  foreign culture or societies. I can see  many environment or  many things from learning the English.

A young lady sits on the chair.  At the front of her, there is a computer.     she shows a computer to someone. I can't see   another person in this room. But   she gesture her hand to a computer. There are  two pets in the room. A dog  on the floor. A cat  is sleeping on the bed.  A typewriter is also  on the desk. I guess she works computer as well as typewriter.  I can see a nice  stereo set near the wall beside the door. I guess  her hobby is listening to the music as  other  young people  love do.   it is quarter before nine o'clock. 
No, I don't have
any pets.
 I like dog better than cat.
Because  dog is more honestly than cat do.   I have no experience  to have dogs,  but many people says that dog can listen to   persons. When you talk to your dog, dog surely  listen to you. I think  its makes you relax. If  you have some stress, your stress will disappear because of dog's attitude.
Yes.
O K.
O K.

One day last week.
  last Friday, I met  my father by accident.  at around  noon, we decided to go  have lunch together. We went to   Italian restaurant.  My father  asked   a waiter  in the restaurant to have a nice seat located in the window side  after we went to the restaurant. I ordered carbonara spaghetti    and fish.  My father ordered  some fried chickens.  We drank some alcohol  instead of non-alcohol drink. It was  our lunch, but we have no business after lunch. So  we could drink alcohol together.  My father owned  lunch fee. I was very full. After we went out  restaurant,   I said to good-by my father, and went back my home.  And  he also  went back his home.
Thank you.
Yes.  I go out  for eating very often with my husband.   in daytime, I need to study very hard at my home alone. I have quite a few opportunity to speak with somebody. I need some fresh air to go outside, otherwise I only stay  in my home. . And my husband is very kind, and he  understands me. So we go outside very often.
Yes.
Yes.

 I'm thinking  what should I do because already I have my office.   I want to maintain my business, and   of course, want to expand my business. But I need more capital. So now I'm thinking two or three years, I will work, then back to the office. But during my working, another two staff members  will . .

Thank you very much.
 Thank you very much.
Thank you.
