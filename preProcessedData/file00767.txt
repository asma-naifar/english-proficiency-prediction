O K. . One day last week,       the boy met  his grandfather, and  they would go to restaurant to eat dinner.     They went to  one restaurant,    and  after they  sit down,      the boy ordered     fish, and the grandfather ordered  meat.      they were enjoying dinner together.     The grandfather paid for the dinner, and after eating    they said good-bye.
