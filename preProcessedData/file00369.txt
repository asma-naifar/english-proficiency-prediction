?
. My name is  .
Yes. And everyone remembers me "Let's go".
 Let's go, .
Yeah.
. On Wednesday? .   no,   last month, I had a  ALC. So  I usually  studied in . But, usually I worked  overtime. Then, I  went back home, and I  had to  cook for dinner  for my husband.  Yes.
Yes.
 O K. . We got married   about   one and half years ago,  like . .   so,  I met him</SC>  when we are in the  junior high school and high school students.
Yes. So, now, ten years or   fifteen years ago.
 Yes.  But  my husband,    no, he is also a work man.  but he  play the rugby on the weekend. And his team,  belonging in the   rugby team. It's more powerful because   his team won the championship  no,  on the  January.  Then, this season,  he is the captain of  team. So it's hard time.
Yes.
No.
No. We have no game on  weekday. . Weekend?
Yes. Sorry. . We have the weekend,   so I go to  see his  games. Yeah.
 . First, I think  it's a     enough time to do for myself. . But, now,   sometimes, I think    we have better have more time to    spend time  with him.   but,  now, he doing his  favorite sports.  So    I meet other friends.
.  .  . I'd like to talk about this picture. I think it's a suburb of the Tokyo. . And it's a sunny day,  maybe, it's  on the weekend. . There are many   people  who have relaxed time. . Example,  the grandfather,  he is sitting on the bench  around the  street. And  he is reading a newspaper, maybe,  it's a  early morning. And the man  who is   jogging,  it's a hard work because he sweat.  And then,   there are womans  who is talking about something. .  one woman      taking  her dogs. .  maybe,  she is on the way to     taking a walk.
. So, so. Because it's  little. . .  I like    more people. . There are little people, I think. But it's good for the health because  it so greeny.
.
 I'm living    near  station. So   very crowded  area and a little bit noisy because  near the  train.  So it's difference, I think. And      there are few people who is jogging  because   near my house is  not good  air.
O K.
.

So they   open that box.   there are  a little cats. . Maybe,  someone  put  on the street. . And  a girl  pick it up to,  maybe, help the cats.   but    a boy  thinking about    it's a good idea or not. . But she     talking him,     we should  help cat. And  they  taking home  to go home.
