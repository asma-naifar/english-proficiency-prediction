I'm , I'm . I have just changed my name. . 
Last December. 
.
.
My wedding? I haven't done that kind of wedding receptions yet. So we are planning to just take photos.
.
 At my previous work place.
 at that time I was working for the trading company and I made a contract with my suppliers that decide the prices.
. These kind of things.
Now? I decided to quit my job in order to concentrate on studying English. So I'm between jobs now. 
I'm looking for a job that I can use my English.
My hobbies. my biggest hobby is that actually writing haiku poems.
 my friends in this fields are much, much older than I. Almost in their sixties, sometimes in their seventies.
So for them, I'm like their granddaughter. 
So they take care of . 
.
. Yes. . I'm not sure I can do but I'd like to try someday.
Where?
Where. I live in near City.
. from my house, I can see that P L Tower. P L Tower,
 that are a kind of a new religion in Japan.
. Perfect liberty like that.
 very, big .
Yes, it's not , really, it's a rural area.
And there are many mountains around my house,
and there is a pond in front of my house.
And there are many wild birds. 
.
.
. . it is the high school classroom and there are many students in the classroom. And the teacher seems to be very concentrated on teaching. she is a mathematic teacher. But most of the students aren't concentrated on studying. in the front line, a boy is looking outside, chewing gums. And in the back, two girl are talking probably about their friends or going out after school, like that. And next to them, a boy is drinking a kind of sports drink or something. And only one boy is listening to the teacher's talking. And next to the boy, a girl is like, I think it's a cellular phone, probably she's writing a e-mails their friends I think it's in the afternoon, it's sunny day.
.
 . when I was in high school, my high school were teachers are very severe teachers. they are really demanding. they were concentrated on making us to enter their prestigious universities. so we had to study very hard. And there were many, many exams almost every week. So the classroom here is quite different from my high school classroom.

 hello, this is . I'm very sorry. I couldn't make it for your party, because my mother suddenly collapsed. my mother lives the my mother is actually in the hospital now. So I couldn't make it. I'm very sorry. But I was very looking forward to seeing you at the party. And next time, I'll be glad to accept your invitation. So please, if you have another party, please invite me.
.
.
. I'm very sorry. But at that time, I had to call a ambulance, because my mother couldn't talk by herself at that time. So I had to call ambulance and I had to be with her about a week. So I couldn't have the time. please accept my feelings.
.
Yes, I'm afraid she had a stroke and she's recovering now. but she really depend on me, because I'm her only daughter, so again, I want to take care of her to my hometown.
.
 thank you very much.
I'm very sorry.
.
.
 actually? when I was very young, in a kindergarten, I think, my father actually collapsed.
. And that time, he had that kind I don't remember the word but stroke. I think that like the same disease as Mister Obuchi.
 and at that time, my mother said, the doctors of him said, he probably won't survive.
 but the operation took about six hours and he really completely recovered.
 and he's over sixty years old now and he's really healthy. actually, he's healthier than my mother.

. the beginning "One day last week"?
 student I went to the station as usual to commute to my work place. And at the platform, I dropped my briefcase under the platform, on the railroad. And the man next to me was unconsciously put his elbow on my arm, and so, I dropped my briefcase. So I complain to him, "What should you do about my briefcase?". but he didn't do anything. And suddenly, the train was coming and I wonder what happened to my briefcase. actually, I almost fall to the railroad. So it was the kind of a very severe accident for me. But after that, the staff of the station came and pick it for me. So the briefcase was not damaged, so I was relieved. that was the accident.
.
 I like local trains, because local trains, I can enjoy a scenery. But like crowded commute trains, I don't these kind of trains or subway. Subway is, I think, Line is very convenient and very fast, but I don't enjoy the scenery outside, so I don't like the subways.
 yes, just once in Washington. as a university student,
 I stayed in , but at that time, I went to Washington with my Japanese friends and my teacher. And at that time, I took subway in Washington.
 they say it's very dangerous, but at that time, it was not so dangerous, and they were very calm,
really.
 . I think it's a little exaggeration in the situation in the United States. .
. Thank you.
After this interview. I have to go back to my home as soon as possible, because I have just married and usually, I live with mother-in-law. And mother-in-law can cook for me and family members.
But she's taking a trip now,
 I have to cook for the family.
So.
 at now, my mother is law in is not here, so three people including me,
and a .
