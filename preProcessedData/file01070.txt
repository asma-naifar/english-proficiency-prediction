O K. . A boy and his father decided to have a lunch together, so they arranged to meet in front of the restaurant. as soon as they entered the restaurant, they were welcomed by a waiter. The father requested for a table near the window. They were shown the table near the window by a waitress. The boy was carefully choosing his menu. Finally, they decided what to eat. And the boy chose the fish. And his father chose the chicken. after they finished lunch, they went to the cashier to pay for the meal. The father paid all cost and the boy was really satisfied. After they went out of the restaurant, they started to walk in different directions because the boy had another plan to go out with his friend.
O K. the service of the restaurant in Japan is really good. So, for example, a waiter and waitress are very careful my customer on the other hand, the service in the United States not so good. and also a customer have to pay the tip in the United States. it's a completely different from Japan and the United States.
