So that is one difference. And <F>er</F> <.></.> so I never wear suits <F>er</F> when I go to a restaurant because it's more casual. <F>Er</F>. <R>And</R> <.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs> and <nvs>cough</nvs> when I go out <F>er</F> for dinner, <R>I usually don't</R> I usually don't drink alcohol.

So <nvs>cough</nvs> but this is a big store.So maybe you can <SC>get a</SC> get another good tape recorders in. I believe so. So <F>er</F> <.></.> I'm going to buy that one. So <.></.> I want you to keep it. <SC>And <F>er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <SC>it</SC> <SC>i</SC></SC> <F>eh</F> and when <SC>I</SC> <SC>it was</SC> it is delivered, maybe I will buy it.
