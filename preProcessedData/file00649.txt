 my name is .
O K.
I'm O K, thank you.

This campus?
So it was built lately, so last year. So this is the second year of this campus.
 I like the building. But it takes about one hour from my house to this campus. So I don't like it.

I live in on Yamanote Line. Do you know?
 It's close to Ikebukuro.

 it is not an area for young people. It is an area for ole people and elder people. And so there are many old persons . Especially, on the fourth day. . Yes. .
 Because it was close to the campus. And that's the reason.
Hobbies? I like movies. And?
What kind of movies? . Sometimes I watch or see action movies or dramas or any kinds.
Action movies?
 when I have something to worry about, and I mean I see an action movie, maybe I can forget what I'm thinking. So most that's the best thing or that's the most exciting thing about seeing action movies.
 and actress? .
. Anthony Hopkins.
Yes. 

. Because he acts well.

 . what the wine is like. And the man is tasting . ? O K. . So this is a kind of formal situation. And there is a piano and there is a big clock. And maybe the foods in this restaurant are quite expensive. .

 I don't usually or maybe when I go to a restaurant because it's more casual. . and when I go out for dinner, I usually don't drink alcohol. So that is another difference. . That's all.
 . Actually, I like drinking.
. yeah, usually So now, I'm living by myself. So I usually go out for dinner. And if I drink whenever I go out, it costs a lot.
. So I want to but I don't. 
. O K.
. Yes. . The other day, this tape recorder.
And can I?
 the other day when I came here, you said the tape recorder is very good in terms of sound.
But when I came back home and I tried, the sound was not really good. partly, it is my fault. But it also your fault that you recommended this tape recorder to me. Because I really wanted to buy a good tape recorder.
I don't think so. . Could you try it?

No, no, no, no. it doesn't sound great. . You see? . Can you see a tape stereo over there?
And that sound is very great. And I like that kind of very . And I have the same kind of tape recorder at home. So I want another one. I need a more expensive one. so if I buy another tape recorder here at this shop, can I give it back to you and get the money back?
I can wait.
Restocking. So but this is a big store.
So maybe you can get another good tape recorders in. I believe so. So I want you to keep it. and when it is delivered, maybe I will buy it. So could you give you this one back to you?
O K.
All right. ,
 can I leave it here?

.
Yeah.
. so it takes a long time to decide to buy something.
.
Finally? . . Depending on someone's advice. I can't decide by myself.
. One day last week, a housewife called Keiko found that there was nothing in the refrigerator. So she decided to go to a supermarket some ingredients everything she wants. put what she bought in the car. And she went back home and cook dinner. .
 Sometimes. Sometimes, very easy one.
For example, instant noodles or scrambled eggs or sunny-side up or something that kind of very easy one. . Because I'm not a good cook.
 when I cook, it cost more than I eat outside. .
. Because I'm not a good cook. And I don't feel like cooking especially when I am tired. so you know, it's very difficult for a single man to use like you buy and the foods when I see it in the refrigerator, it's already impossible,
 to eat.

 
.
All right. Thank you.
