 my name is .
O K.
I'm O K, thank you.

This campus?
So   it was built lately, so last year. So this is the second year of this  campus.
 I like the building. But it takes  about one hour from my house to this campus. So I don't like it.

I live in  near the old campus. So it was located in Sugamo  on Yamanote Line. Do you know?
   It's close to Ikebukuro.

       it is not an area for young people.  It is an area for ole people and elder people. And  so    there are many old persons  around my house. . Especially, on the fourth day.  . Yes. .
 Because     it was close to the campus. And  yes.   that's the reason.
Hobbies?   I like movies.   And?
What kind of movies?   I like every kind of movies. . Sometimes I watch or see action movies or  human  dramas or any kinds.
Action movies?
      when I have something to worry about,  and    I mean I see an action movie,  maybe I can forget   what I'm thinking. So    that's the best thing or that's the most exciting thing about  seeing action movies.
 and actress?   .
? .  Maybe Paul Newman or  Anthony Hopkins.
Yes. 

. Because he acts well.

 .  A man and a woman are in a restaurant. And     there is a   sommelier. And he is describing  what the wine is like. And the man is tasting .  And maybe he's going to drink the wine.  ? O K. .  So this is a kind of formal situation. And  there is a piano and there is a big clock. And  maybe  the foods in this restaurant are quite expensive.  .

 .   I don't usually or maybe   I rarely go to an expensive restaurant. So that is one difference. And   so I never wear suits  when I go to a restaurant because it's more casual. .    and  when I go out  for dinner,  I usually don't drink alcohol. So that is another difference. .    . That's all.
  . Actually, I like drinking.
 . .  So now,    I'm living by myself. So I usually go out for dinner. And  if I drink  whenever I go out,  it costs a lot.
. So I want to but I don't. 
. O K.
.  Yes. . The other day,   I bought   this tape recorder.
And   now, I don't like it. So I want to give it back to you and I want to get the money back.  can I?
   but  the other day when I came here,  you said the tape recorder is very good  in terms of sound.
But  when I    came back home and I tried,  the sound  was not really good.   so maybe  partly,  it is my fault. But it also your fault  that you recommended this tape recorder to me. Because I really wanted to buy a good tape recorder.
I don't think so. . Could you try it?

No, no, no, no.  it doesn't sound great. . You see? . Can you see a tape stereo over there?
And that sound is very  great. And I like  that kind of very  good one I want. . And I have the same kind of tape recorder at home. So I want another one. I need a more expensive one.    so  if I buy  another tape recorder here at this shop, can I give it back to you and get the money back?
I can wait.
Restocking. So  but this is a big store.
So maybe you can  get another good tape recorders in. I believe so. So   I'm going to buy that one. So  I want you to keep it.     and when   it is delivered, maybe I will buy it. So could you give you this one  back to you?
O K.
All right. ,
 can I leave it here?

.
Yeah.
.  Yes.       I'm not good at deciding something.    so   it takes a long time to decide to buy something.
. Especially when it is a quite expensive one. .
Finally?  .  . Depending on someone's advice.  So     I can't decide by myself.
.  One day last week, a housewife    called  Keiko  found that  there was nothing in the refrigerator. So she decided to go to a supermarket  to buy some foods for dinner. And she went to a supermarket by car. And in the supermarket, she bought   everything she wants.   and       she buy everything required for dinner. And she  put  what she bought in the car. And she went back home and cook dinner.  . That's the end of the .
 Sometimes. Sometimes, very   easy one.
For example,    instant noodles or         scrambled eggs or sunny-side up or   something     made of eggs. And     that kind of very easy one. . Because I'm not a good cook.
 so maybe  when I cook, it cost more   than I eat outside. .
. Because I'm not a good cook. And    sometimes   I don't feel like cooking     especially  when I am tired.    so    you know,   it's very difficult  for a single man to use  everything  like you buy  at supermarket.    and the foods  and get rotten or go bad in the refrigerator. And    when I  see it in the refrigerator,  it's already  impossible,
   to eat.

. I will try to cook. 
.
All right. Thank you.
