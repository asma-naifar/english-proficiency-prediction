And it's          how can I say, it's very  beautiful and water is very clean and   the temperature of water is very hot. But    when    I'm in the hot springs,   I can forget  all things around me. So  I can be relaxed. So  it's my favorite   spot.

And  beside the ski slope,  there is  a   ski lift, but nobody  gets on it. And   right side of this picture,  there are several skiers listening  to what this instructor is saying because they are beginner. And they wanted to  be good ski player. And besides them,   in center of this picture,  the lady  in  yellow is    skiing very well. And beside her    the man in black  is crashing into snow. And  from upper side of this picture,  we can see the boy  enjoying snowboard. Beside the ski slope,  there is a log house.  In it,  we can see two ladies   who are taking a rest  to drink  something hot. And in front of  log house,  we can see  four children  enjoying snow fight. .
