   there are   many people        who wears  dress and   maybe, I think    this restaurant costs a lot of money. And the food is  maybe expensive.   and     I think this    two people celebrate this woman's birthday.
And  maybe   I think    this man often come to this restaurant. And so   he knows the wine     which is  better for her. So  maybe    he call      this owner     what wine is  suitable for her.
