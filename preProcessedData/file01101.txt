Hi. .
 my name is .
. Sure.
Good, thank you. How are you?
Great.
I live in about fifteen minutes from here by train. And yeah, I take subway around twenty minutes in the morning. .
.
 Not very far. .
 sure. is residential area. it used be a bit risky, not safe area, but recently many shops are coming in, and nice shopping area as well. So I really like living there. We got not a house but apartment after marriage. And we've been there for four years. Yeah. .
. I heard, but when we moved in, it had been already developed well. Yeah. But some peoples says that there're many drinking places so some old guys drink from day time, and some drunken guys around the station, they used be.
 yeah.
 marriage, yeah. We met in States in . the first time, we met at golf driving range. I was really bad at golf at the time. my husband to be at that time, found me, and, "What a awful golfer," he thought. And then he started teaching me, that was the first time we met. And then we came back together. And I started working for , and my husband works for a construction company in Japan. Then after two years, we got married.
Yeah.
 together.
 study fortunately, they had the same research program as what I studied in Tokyo. And they had the same research program, and my professor in Tokyo offered me to do the same researching in the States. And I was really interested in studying abroad. So yeah, I asked him, "Can I go there, and do the same research, and bring back for my master degree?". So it was really lucky for me. .
 it has been four years.
Yeah. And actually I studied the biochemistry and now I'm doing marketing so totally different. But the care what your background is. And actually in terms of research, it's the same of the marketing method and biochemistry method. You make a hypothesis, and research, and prove, then next step. So the step is the same. Only the difference is bacteria or human beings. So that's the difference I find.
Yeah.
. 
So far. Yeah.
O K.
O K. here, this is a ski slope in a winter mountain. And plenty of snow and plenty of skiers there. Some people skiing. And some people are playing with the snowballs throwing each other. there is the cottage, and a couple is enjoying the coffee, and maybe chatting together. And one of the skiers are in the snow with one of the skies off from his foot. And maybe he needs help, but no one is approaching to him. And one of the skiers, not ski, he's not on the ski, but snowboard. And he's enjoying snowboarding in deep thick snow. And no one is on the chairs. So I guess this ski slope is not so crowded. And on the right hand side, there is a coach. I guess he is the coach because he's giving a sign to one of the girls approaching to the coach and the other students. And she looks a bit nervous. She's just staring at her front, just watching straight and trying to keep her .
O K.
Yeah. I love it.
Yeah. I used to belong the ski team.
Yeah.
 I skied was in Nagano. It was in Shigakogen. It's a big big snow slope. And you can spend like three days trying all the chairs. It's a huge mountain, and it's one of my favorite place.
Yeah.
I used to be. 
Beginner.
. actually, I used to do instructor, and 
one of the best method I thought was start skiing without the poles. Because if you have poles on your hands, then your focus is both on your skies and poles. And you're more likely destructed. But without poles, you can really concentrate on the foot and skies. So it's the better way to start skiing. And also you feel really afraid when you first try the chairs. some beginners get the poles stuck on the snow, and some people really getting trouble sticking on the poles and your body stuck on the poles, and finally chairs stop. And people start complaining to you. So the best way is without poles. Yeah. After one day, yeah, you can ski without poles.
 You should try it.
.
O K. ? .
Silently.
O K. Sure.
Hello. this is speaking.
Hi. I'm sorry you kindly invited me to your dinner party, but I couldn't make it. actually I really feel sorry. But actually my mom got sick last night, and this morning, I visited her. But her condition was really in bad. And I took her to the hospital, and she needed to go straight to the intensive care room. So I needed to be with her. And I try to call you, call you, call you. But maybe you were busy preparing for the dinner party. .
Yeah. I knew. I really feel sorry.
 really? ?
.
Yeah, that's why we got so surprised and shocked. Because she was in a good shape during the day time. And late night, she suddenly felt sick, and my father called me and something wrong is happening on my mom. And he needed my help. And I went to her house. And it was really sudden accident, and we haven't really found out what happened. But I feel sorry, and next time I'm eager to join your party if possible. could you invite me for the next time?
 yeah, you are the first one I called since last night, and yeah, maybe I will see them this week. And I will apologize from my side as well. So yeah, I know that the party was really important, and I was looking forward to it. And hopefully by the next Friday, if my mom will get better. .
Yeah.
 that'll be great.
.
 thank you very much, and sorry. Bye.
.
O K.
 I love it. 
 I like talking to many people.
Sorry?
? Yes. since I came back from the States, I often hold a home party. because I learned how to have a home party in the States. It's not very formal. Just with the close friends. And some people don't know other people in the party, but it doesn't matter, they can introduce each other. Then just chatting, chatting, and drink, and eat. That's a nice chance to see each other. And sometimes I'm really surprised at the, for example, you have not met my friends, but coincidentally, you know someone who they know really well. And then they start next conversation, and have the common stories, and, " did you know her?". And you get surprised, but it's a nice surprise to develop the other stories as well. So that's the good thing to have a home party, and invite the different kinds of friends.
Yeah.
O K.
.
.
O K. his orange car, not very big, tiny, but looks comfortable car. then from the other side, another guy on the bike was coming talking on his mobile phone, talking to maybe his girlfriend. He looks so happy. Then the next moment, the orange car hit the back of the bike, and the biker dropped his mobile phone. They got surprised at the same time. Of course, the biker got mad. He looked really angry, and started complaining, " shame, it's my bike got broken. The back of the bike is totally broken. Also my mobile is broken.". Then the driver in the orange car pick up the mobile phone. And the police came to the two, and started taking a note of their dictation. The driver started explaining what happened holding the mobile phone of the biker. The biker doesn't seem happy, of course. Then after police finish the dictation, the big truck came to pick up the broken bike. And the biker was watching the truck taking his bike maybe to the garage. The biker look a bit sad having his helmet on his hands. .
Yes, I have.
 yes. I should know. .
O K. when you have an accident on a street, first, you have to pull over on the street, and you have to stop. Then get out of the car. And, O K, this is the situation when you hit the other person. Then of course the other person is supposed to be around my car. Then we have to call first to the police wherever or whenever. Then you should be there. you shouldn't change anything because proof must be there. Then when the police arrived to your site, then start explaining. But they say exceptionally, the other person is injured or if you are injured, then call police, and at the same time, you have to call to the emergency to have a emergency car. And if it is really urgent, you need to do something on the other person. Then you should do like heart pressing or urgent take care for the other person. But the basic rule is to call to the police.

 I don't wanna have .
O K.
 after work today, tonight I'm visiting my parents. They live just ten minutes bike .
It's so convenient. And my husband works late on weekdays. So I have a choice to spend night at their house or my house or staying here for later.

Thank you.
Thank you very much.
