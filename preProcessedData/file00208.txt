So it means that I came here   three years ago.
 maybe about one and a half years ago.

Yeah.  this was last time to go back to yeah my home town.
Actually I prefer  .
 because   is a very     good place, good city, good environment.  has a  very good environment to  live in.
 I mean there are  many  nature and the  compare with Tokyo,  there are only few cars and traffic jam. So yeah, it is very good environment  to live for me.
Yeah.
.
. No. Actually, no. Because  I don't have enough money to buy  a new car.   Actually,  it cost  too high to live here.  so,  I can't buy a car. But, actually   I love a car. So,  if I have a opportunity to buy a car, maybe I will buy a car.
 if I get the permission from my wife.
.
 I like to buy a Cherokee.

Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
 O K. .
 O K.   I will  describe  about this picture. So      this is a mountain  for skiing and the this mountain is covered with snow. So, there are  many skiers  on this mountain. So, I can see the ski  lift  and the  most of the people in this picture are maybe   enjoying skiing. And the  one of them are enjoying snowboarding. So, maybe he is a very good snowboarder because a  formal experience.   maybe I'm a very good  skier or snowboarder because   I came from  so,  I have many a lot of experience  to ski and snowboard. Maybe his style is looks very nice, so maybe he is a very good snowboarder. And the   the people who are enjoying skiing and snowboarding are  only adults. And the  please take a look at  left side of this picture. So,  there are four children is here and  now they are playing,  how can I say, throwing a snowball  to each other. So,  I don't know the exact name of the  this playing but  actually  I also have a  kind of this experience, for playing to threw the snowball  snowball to  other people. Yeah.  and there are   big lodge made by wood. Maybe it's a made by wood. And  there are two people in this lodge and now they are  enjoying talking and   having  drinking?  I'm not sure what kind of drinks. But now they are very  looks enjoying. And    I have to say that. One of the skiers   is falling and the now,   one of his skis  are  how can I say? got off from his leg. So now maybe he is in trouble. Yeah.  . .
 yes.  almost all.
.
Yes.
 Snowboarder? O K.
. Actually  it is said that snowboarding is much easier than skiing  because  as you can see, snowboarding is a only one board and  yeah,   if you play skiing,    you have to ride on     two ski  boards.  but  actually, how can I say, if you try to play  snowboarding,  I have to say that you have to     weigh your weight   front.  when you play snowboarding and the your weight is a backside, it is very dangerous because  it is quite different from skiing. Snowboarding is a very dangerous because   if you  fall   you can't protect your body  because you don't have a . And the so, in this case, maybe you use  your hand to protect your body. But it is very dangerous. So, maybe in this case,   you will place your  arm?
And so on. And so,  
.
 you're welcome.
.
Yes.
.
O K.  could you give me ?
, to read it.

O K.
Hello, I'm .
 so,  firstly I have to apologize you      I can't go to  your party   because  I have to meet my  very important customer.   so in this case, yeah,  just I can't do . I apologize you.
. Yeah.  I can understand what you said, but  the customer   I will meet  in this day is a  very important  customer for me. In this case, for me. Because  now I try to start   new business. And  the people     whom I will meet  in this day is a key person to start
 my new own business. So yeah,  only I have to meet. <CO>And   in this case, another people is not good
</CO>.

 Yes.

.
Party?
 in Japan or  another country O K?
In U S.
.
. Actually     I have never had a party .
Yes. .
 Yes. .
 I stayed in U S  from last August to December
to study English and to learn about American culture.
So,  when  I was in the U S  I had  many parties, yeah,  which were held by  sometimes my friend and sometimes my host family. .
And the sometimes my   teacher in university. .
 actually   I don't have experience  the party in Japan.
 I can guess.     maybe it's my stereotype image, but Japanese parties are  very formal.
Very formal. So, I mean, if I go to the party  in Japan, maybe I have to wear the very formal suit. And yeah,  and the cost is maybe very high. And   I think Japanese  parties are very extravagant.  but the American parties are  very casual. So,  actually I have a experience to attend the party.      I wore a very casual clothe  like this,
now I'm wearing. So and  maybe the cost was very cheap, very  low,
  it's very casual and actually I prefer American party because it's very easy to enjoy. .
Yes.
.
.
.
Last week.
.  O K. One day last week.   I will describe about this picture.
So  please take a look at this. . Number one picture.
This is me.
Yeah.  one day last week,   last Friday. I think it's a last Friday.    I went to the station  to  go back to my home. .  no. Sorry. .
