So <F>umm</F> <.></.> <F>urr</F> <SC>this picture is a</SC> <F>urr</F> this is a mountain <F>urr</F> for skiing and the this mountain is covered with snow. So, there are <R>many</R> many skiers <F>err</F> on this mountain. So, I can see the ski <R>lift</R> lift <F>umm</F> and the <R>most of</R> most of the people in this picture are maybe <R>enjoying skiing</R> <F>err</F> enjoying skiing. And the <F>urr</F> one of them are enjoying snowboarding. So, maybe he is a very good snowboarder because a <F>err</F> formal experience. <F>Urr</F> <SC>maybe <F>err</F> <R>I</R> I</SC> maybe I'm a very good <F>umm</F> skier or snowboarder because <R>I</R> <SC>I come</SC> I came from <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> so, <F>err</F> I have many a lot of experience <F>urr</F> to ski and snowboard. Maybe his style is looks very nice, so maybe he is a very good snowboarder. And the <F>umm</F> <.></.> the people who are enjoying skiing and snowboarding are <SC>adult</SC> only adults. And the <F>err</F> please take a look at <F>err</F> left side of this picture. So, <F>err</F> there are four children is here and <SC>the</SC> now they are playing, <F>err</F> how can I say, throwing a snowball <F>err</F> to each other. So, <F>urm</F> I don't know the exact name of the <F>urr</F> this playing but <F>mmm</F> actually <R>I</R> I also have a <F>urr</F> kind of this experience, for playing to threw the snowball <F>urr</F> snowball to <F>urr</F> other people. Yeah. <F>Umm</F> and there are <R>big</R> <SC>big house</SC> big lodge made by wood. Maybe it's a made by wood. And <R>the</R> there are two people in this lodge and now they are <F>urr</F> enjoying talking and <R>the</R> <F>urr</F> having <.></.> drinking? <F>Umm</F> I'm not sure what kind of drinks. But now they are very <F>urr</F> looks enjoying. And <SC>the</SC> <F>ohh</F> <R>I</R> I have to say that. One of the skiers <R>are now</R> <F>urr</F> is falling and the now, <SC>he</SC> <R>one of his skis</R> one of his skis <R>are</R> are <F>urr</F> how can I say? got off from his leg. So now maybe he is in trouble. Yeah. <.></.> <F>Urr</F>. <CO>And</CO>.<F>Ohh</F> yes. <F>Umm</F> almost all.<F>Uh-hum</F>.Yes.<F>Ah</F> Snowboarder? O K.<F>Mmm</F>. Actually <F>urr</F> it is said that snowboarding is much easier than skiing <F>umm</F> because <F>urr</F> as you can see, snowboarding is a only one board and <F>arr</F> yeah, <SC>ski</SC> <F>urr</F> if you play skiing, <F>umm</F> <SC>you have to, how can I say, <R>mana</R> manage</SC> <F>urr</F> you have to ride on <SC>a</SC> <R>two</R> <F>urr</F> <R>two ski</R> two ski <SC>board</SC> boards. <SC>So</SC> but <F>urr</F> actually, how can I say, if you try to play <F>urr</F> snowboarding, <F>urr</F> I have to say that you have to <F>urr</F> <R>weigh</R> <R>weigh your</R> <F>urr</F> weigh your weight <F>urr</F> <R>front</R> front. <SC>If you</SC> when you play snowboarding and the your weight is a backside, it is very dangerous because <F>umm</F> it is quite different from skiing. Snowboarding is a very dangerous because <F>urr</F> <SC>if you fail</SC> if you <F>urr</F> fall <F>urr</F> <R>you</R> you can't protect your body <F>orr</F> because you don't have a <JP>stock</JP>. And the so, in this case, maybe you use <R>your</R> your hand to protect your body. But it is very dangerous. So, maybe in this case, <SC>you will <F>urr</F> <.></.> pro</SC> <F>urr</F> you will place your <F>err</F> arm?And so on. And so, <.></.> <laughter>please take care</laughter><OL>if you play snowboarding</OL>.<F>Oh</F> you're welcome.<F>Uh-hum</F>.Yes.<F>Uh-hum</F>.O K. <F>Oh</F> could you give me <?>the time, please</?>?<OL>Yeah</OL>, to read it.<laughter>This your card</laughter>?<F>Oh</F>. <.></.> Just a moment, please.<laughter>O K, too bad</laughter>. <.></.> <F>Uh-hum</F>.<F>Oh</F>. <R>O K</R> O K. <OL><F>Urr</F></OL>.Maybe.
