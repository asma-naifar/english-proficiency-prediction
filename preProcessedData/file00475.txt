. My name is .
Nice to meet you.
. I live in  . . Yeah. I take a train,   line,  from  station to  station, then I walk to this office.

Yes.
Yes, yes. With my mother.
. About six years.
 . In my neighborhood,    very busy place because  there are many shops near here. Because  my house is   near the station, about  five minutes walk. So, very busy place.
. Yes. . I have  two big hobbies. One is  diving. And the other one is  sugar craft. Do you know sugar craft?
O K.  . Sugar craft means  like  cake decorating. So I use a sugar, and,  at first,  make a sugar paste with sugar and make  paste or something. And I make some flowers or decorating  cakes like a wedding cake. So I have   taken  lesson about  ten years.
Yes.
Yes. 
So  I made  many wedding cakes for my friends.
Yeah. 
. Yes.      I go to  my teacher's house in .
And,  three years ago   I visit to  London and stay for two months and  taking a lesson and watching somethings.
. At first,  I'd like to take  lesson and  just my hobby. But, now,   my thought is changed. Maybe, in the future, maybe, I will be in a old man or old woman, maybe. . I'd like to be a teacher or have a school.
.

. Describe? So this picture shows    winter season, especially   skiing. . Many people    enjoying  skiing. And   some children playing  throw  snow balls. And two couples having  tea or coffee   in a house.
Yeah. .  no, I don't. But,  maybe, ten year's ago,  I enjoyed  skiing sometimes.
. Because I hate  cold days. 
.
Yeah.
 So  because  in the water,  the  scenery,    occasionally it's very different  from usual. So   I can't  sound nothing in the water. But   I can watch  many beautiful craves and  many kind of fishes. . And  especially  when I      look up to the sky and from the water,  the sunshine is very beautiful. So, sometimes I took a picture.
O K.
