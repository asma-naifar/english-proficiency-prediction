 my name is .
Yes.
 today, I'm very fine.     I skip my class because   I take this exam.
Yes.  but  my teacher  allowed me   to come here.
.
Yeah.
 I live in  , near  Prefecture.  my hometown is industrial area, so  there are a lot of factories. And my father also has his own factory. But  in this  current economic recession,  my father's job  is  very bad,  unfortunately.
.
But my mother    helps  my father. .  my mother is a nurse and sometimes  she works a night shift but  she is forty-six years old. I think a night shift is very bad for her health. .
But   she really   enjoy    her job.
And  my brother   also is a male nurse. Because  he really respects my mother. .
.
.    sometimes   I cooked for my family. And  my father . And    it is not necessary for mother   to do housework.  my family  helps  my mother. . I think it's very good. .
.
No. I am a  senior.
Yes. So       on Thursday, I have to hand over my thesis to my  professor.
 but fortunately, I finish  writing  my thesis, so  I'm very happy now.

Next year?    decided yet.  but  in January, I'm going to take an exam,  the national medical college.  I want to be a speech  speech therapist. But   there are few speech therapist in Japan.  just   two thousand people work  at hospital.  and also, there are few schools and there is  only one national medical college. .
So  it is very hard to enter the national medical college, to go to school.  but I try. .
.
Yes. O K.
This picture. . There are   several customers in a restaurant, and they're drinking a wine and   having something. And  they wear    formal clothes.  I think      they enjoy music. And  it is  very different from casual restaurant where  I usually . . .   it seems very expensive  restaurant. . . Maybe they eat  French or Italian food.  and    one waiter recommend a bottle of wine to a customer. . And    there is a big clock but       it is very old and expensive, I think. . That's all.
.
No, no. because I have allergy for alcohol.
But  sometimes  I go to a Japanese pub. And I try to Japanese rice wine .    I can't enjoy it.
And my father and  mother  also  drink,  alcohol.   so  my mother can  drink it a little bit. . But  my family   don't like it.
.
.
Yes.
 I don't care because  my tension is very high. So my friend, " you  you looks like a drinking.".  but  I don't drink at all. . I just enjoy  the atmosphere. . It is necessary to drink alcohol for me.
No.
Yes, yes.    my friends never  recommend and       give me a obligation to drink something. . My friend is, yeah, very good.
. And  sometimes I hear the  big problem to  drink alcohol  straightly.   young guy  drink   a lot of alcohol  at one time, and sometimes      he dies.  but     my friend and I   never do it. . Just  we're enjoy atmosphere and a little bit alcohol  is O K.
.
.
 Just a moment, please.
 .
. O K. I think it is very difficult.

One day a last week,           they planned   to go out but  it rained. So    they were making another plan. And  the good idea     hit on them, so they   decided to go to a theater to watch a movie.   and    they went to   theater  in the afternoon. And they bought a  drinks and popcorns and   they watched  movies            with a drinking and eating. And they watched   the films.  the airplane  was crashed. And       after watching films,   they talked  about films. And they very enjoyed it.
Yes. I like a movies very much.
I prefer  going to movie theater because  I can watch  films  in a big screen. It is very good  because I enjoy  atmosphere. And    I think  the big difference between  movie theater and    is a feeling. .   if I watch a   big  screen,    I will think, "  it's real thing.". And I also enjoy  color. So     if I watch it  in movie theater,  the color is  very , I think.
.   because  small television is a screen's color.     technologically, so  big screen is  very good, I think. .
More beautiful. .
Yes.
? 
? 
.
 after this exam?   I am going to a restaurant to eat Okinawa food.  because   today, I get a brochure  from this shop. And  normally,    we have to pay  six hundred yen but today is a discount price, so   we pay only three thousand and ninety yen. .
Yes.
Yes.
Thank you.
