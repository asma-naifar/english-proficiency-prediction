<F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>.<F>Oh</F> of course.<F>Oh</F>. Fine thank you. And you?Good.It is.<F>Am</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I got it</SC> <F>well</F> <F>uh</F> I got a luncheon meeting, so <F>ah</F> at the meeting, I got a lunch box.<F>Mm</F>.<F>Em</F> usually, I'm going to outside for cafeteria <SC>or if I have the time</SC> if I don't have much time or <F>er</F> I will buy a lunch box from convenience store.<OL>And</OL> I will take a lunch, you know, <SC>on the</SC> <SC>on a table</SC> <SC>on a desk</SC>.<F>Well</F> sometimes. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Pretend to be busy.<F>Mm</F>.<F>Ah</F> my working for marketing for foods.<OL><F>Um</F></OL> <F>well</F> I'm in charge of spreads marketing, so I'm actually working for Rama Margarine in Japan. And also <F>well</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>I no</SC> as a marketing team, <R>I'm</R> I'm developing their <R>new pro</R> new products for margarine for Japan. I mean, for I am <R>also</R> <F>er</F> also <F>um</F> getting the new products from overseas to Japan.Yes.Yes, it is. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Erm</F> <F>well</F>I can't say in openly but <F>em</F> <SC>that's</SC> the <SC>a</SC> incident is good for us. Because the <F>er</F> consumers' perception against Snow is getting lower now. I mean, brand is <SC>getting lo</SC> getting weaker now. So at the same time, Rama is <SC>setting</SC> getting <F>em</F> increase of the sales now.<F>Hmm</F>.Yes. That's the a little <?>bit</?> problem. But the <F>er</F> <F>well</F> we are announcing in public, <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> our product is very safe. And also <F>er</F> we are announcing on the <SC>P O</SC> <SC>post</SC> point of purchase, P O P <F>em</F> on the shelf or that kind of thing.<OL>So</OL> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I think <F>well</F></SC> the wind <F>well</F> is blowing for us.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Erm</F>. I'm originally from Fukuoka, Kyushu area.<F>Em</F>. When I was a university student, I came to Yokohama. And I stayed in there and, <F>well</F> once I tried to <R>co</R> come back to <SC>home</SC> <R>my</R> my home country. <F>Well</F> that's why I joined this company. And actually, I used to work in another company in Tokyo area. And I joined to Uni Leva, saying I'd like go back to home country, <SC>so</SC> <F>er</F> as a sales. Then, I move back to home country, working at the sales. But <F>well</F> somehow, I came back here and working now in Tokyo.<OL>Yes, a lot</OL>. <OL>Yes, a lot</OL>.<F>Ah</F> the best place was in New Zealand.<F>Well</F> actually, I moved from Fukuoka to Kagoshima and U. K. for <R>le</R> learning English over there for six months. And moved back to Tokyo and sent to New Zealand.And came back to Yokohama, Utsunomiya and,<OL>now I'm living</OL> in Saitama.<F>Well</F> the very good atmosphere for family. And also <SC>the</SC> I like natures. I mean that's why I wanted to come back to my home country Fukuoka. Because <F>well</F> <SC>very nice</SC> <F>well</F> how could I say, Fukuoka is the <SC>very nice c</SC> <F>well</F> very <F>ah</F> <F>em</F> cosmopolitan area. <F>Well</F> central Fukuoka is <F>well</F> business city. But <SC>outside</SC> how could I say, <F>um</F> surrounding of the <F>er</F> cities, <F>well</F> we could see <SC>a lots of natu</SC> lots of nature remains <F>er</F> still. So <F>er</F> I prefer that kind of situation. And New Zealand is exactly <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <R>what I</R> <R>what I wa</R> what I want to <?>live</?>. So <F>er</F> <R>very nice</R> very nice ocean views and mountainsides <SC>and</SC> but still, <F>em</F> how could they say, <F>em</F> <F>well</F> for business, <R>they are</R> they are working <R>proper</R> proper business over there. <CO>So</CO>.<nvs>sniff</nvs>Yeah.Right. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> maybe <F>er</F> this is <R>the</R> <F>er</F> the lady's <SC>room</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>private room</SC> bedroom. So <F>er</F> <SC>she has</SC> yes, <R>the</R> <F>well</F> <R>there</R> <SC>there wa</SC> there is <SC>be</SC> <SC>wa</SC> a bed and computer, typewriter and stereos. And also, she seems like <F>em</F>like pets. <SC>There i</SC> there are dog and cat. <.></.> And more?<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<nvs>sniff</nvs><OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Oh</F> no, <F>well</F> to be honest, I don't like it.<OL><F>Mm</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> maybe because of my <F>erm</F> backgrounds. Because <R>in</R> <F>well</F> <F>erm</F> in a country area <F>well</F> in Japan, <F>well</F> many people have a pet in outside of the <F>er</F> house. And also, I did the same thing, I mean, always my parents said, <F>well</F> "Don't take pet into the room.".And I didn't do it. So <F>er</F> I still I believe <F>well</F> the pet <R>should</R> should live in outside of the house.I mean, that's the a pet's life.<F>Em</F> <SC>that's why I think</SC> and also <SC>that is not good for ma</SC> <SC>fo</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>em</F> the hair of the <F>er</F> pets is <OL>not</OL>,good for health. That is <?>by heart</?>.So <F>er</F> if I think about my kids,<OL><F>well</F></OL> kids always want to have a pet but I'm now living in <F>em</F> small apartment house. So if we have a pet, we have to put the pet into house.But I don't want <R>ki</R> kids play around the pet <R>in the</R> in the room.<OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.<F>Well</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <R>may</R> maybe because they think <F>em</F> <SC>the pet is not the o</SC> <R>pe</R> pet is not any more pet. I mean, pet is the <F>er</F> like <SC>a child</SC> their child. <F>Mm</F> maybe that's why. <F>Mmm</F>. But <SC>I think</SC> <R>when I</R> when I think from the side of pet,<R>I don't know</R> <?>yeah</?> I don't know because <SC>I can con</SC> I cannot have a conversation with them. But maybe pets wants to live outside, I mean, nature. <F>Oh</F> that's my <laughter>thinking</laughter>.<OL><F>Mm</F> <F>mm</F></OL>. Honest speaking, yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Erm</F>.<F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> <SC>fir</SC> <F>well</F> before I start the explaining my room,<F>Em</F> maybe it's better to explain my family.Because there are two kids. And the elder daughter is <F>ei</F> ten years old. And younger son is six years old. So they are quite <.></.> <R>bi</R> big now. And <R>n</R> now, they are sharing the room. But both of them started say "I'd like to have a room." and "I'd like a room.". So <F>er</F> I'm living in a three <F>er</F> so-called <SC>three</SC> <F>em</F> <JP><SC>san e</SC></JP> three L D K, three bedrooms and living room. <F>Erm</F> in total, seventy-four square meters. So <F>er</F> not quite big. So <F>er</F> two kids are sharing one room. And <SC>one i</SC> one room is for almost storage. There is the <F>er</F> <R>bookshelv</R> <F>er</F> bookshelves and also clothing <F>em</F> cabinet.And that kind of things. And in the living room, <F>em</F> there is the <SC>P C</SC> computer. <F>Well</F> it's that the same thing. And stereo, T V and one other left room is the <F>er</F> for <?>our</?> bedroom.<F>Mmm</F>.Just I noticed the strange <?>thing here</?>.Because it's June. <CO>But still she is wearing the</CO>. <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.<F>Mm-hum</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K. <ctxt>interviewee is reading the card</ctxt> <JP>Hay</JP>.<JP><SC>Hay</SC></JP> <F>ah</F> yes.Hi.<F>Oh</F>, hi. I'm sorry <SC>you ca</SC> <F>well</F> <R>sorry</R> <F>er</F> sorry to make you call me. <F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> I have to call you <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> first.Because <F>em</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>well</F> first of all, I have to apologize that I couldn't <SC>make a</SC> <R>make</R> make to go to the party.<F>Oh</F> no sorry. <SC>I could</SC> <F>well</F> that's why I thought the <F>er</F> you called me. <F>Well</F> why I couldn't make it. <F>Em</F> <F>er</F> now, I have to said the reason.

So I have to take care of him. So <F>er</F> <F>well</F> unfortunately, this time I couldn't make it. But <F>well</F> next time, I really love to go there. So <F>er</F> could you <F>well</F> please <R>le</R> <F>well</F> let me know <OL>when</OL> you have another party.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Well</F> yes that was my plan. <F>Em</F> <F>well</F> first of all, I wanted to take my son together with me,<?>if</?> he is fine. But unfortunately, I took him to the doctor and now, I have to take care of him <F>well</F> <SC>at hou</SC> at home.So <F>er</F> unfortunately, sorry for that.<F>Uh-oh</F>. <laughter><F>Oh</F> so</laughter> I missed the <F>er</F> surprise. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Well</F></OL>.<F>Oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>erm</F> <F>well</F> <F>well</F> sorry but <F>erm</F> <F>well</F> how about tomorrow? <SC>I will come</SC> I will go there and <SC>take it the</SC> <F>er</F> <F>well</F> I will take my son together. So <F>er</F> we will have the all sushi.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Thank you very much.Thank you. <OL>Thank you for calling</OL>.Yeah. Bye-bye.<F>Em</F> yes. <F>Well</F> <R>not</R> not in Japan, many times.<F>Well</F> because of the very small apartment house. <F>Well</F> sorry <F>well</F> <SC>this i</SC> <SC>this conversation is not</SC> <F>em</F> <R>I</R> I don't have to <OL>play a role</OL>.O K. Right. <nvs>laughter</nvs>That's O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So, yes. <F>Erm</F> personally, I'd like to have a party but,unfortunately, because of the <F>er</F> house, I mean, my house is located in Omiya. So <R>qui</R> <F>er</F> quite far from here, so when I got the <F>er</F> for instance, visitors from overseas,sometimes I ask them to come over to my house,and get a small party. Because <F>well</F> they would like to see <F>er</F> in a real Japanese house situation.<F>Mmm</F>.<CO><OL><F>Em</F> i</OL></CO>.Yes. <F>Em</F> yes and no. Because the <F>er</F> yes means the <F>er</F> <SC>I try to get it</SC> <F>well</F> I try to cook Japanese foods. And personally, I love to cook. So <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> for instance, every weekends,I'm cooking. So <F>er</F> <SC>I like to cook <F>em</F> for them</SC> I like cook Japanese foods for them. But at the same time, I'd like to share the information. <SC>So</SC> <F>well</F> not share the information. <SC>Share the</SC> <F>er</F> how could I say, <F>well</F> just I'd like to share <F>em</F> all of things. So <F>er</F> that's why I ask them to cook for us as <F>well</F>. So <F>er</F> <F>well</F> if I invite people to the house, <SC>I don't want them <F>uh</F> feel</SC> <F>em</F> how could I say, <JP><F>eh</F></JP> <R>I</R> I'd like them to feel comfortable at home.So <F>well</F> although I ask them to come over, I don't <?>want</?> force them to come to us. <F>Oh</F> you are not with me. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Em</F> so always I'm asking "Let's share the foods,so I will cook for you. But also you will cook for us.".<F>Mm</F> <R>That</R> that's we mean.<OL>Always</OL> I'm doing that.So <F>er</F> <R>we can</R> we can discuss the <F>er</F> <SC?>wa</SC?> <F>em</F> about <SC>foods</SC> each country's foods. And also the <F>er</F> those background of their foods as well.<OL><F>Mmm</F></OL>.Yeah.<OL><F>Mm-hum</F></OL>.Yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K. <F>Em</F> can I have a time to <R>lo</R> <SC>look</SC> <OL>think about</OL>?O K. <F>Em</F> one day last week, <SC>one driver</SC> <R>wa</R> <SC>wa</SC> <R>on</R> one driver <SC?>were</SC?> <F>ah</F> sorry, one person is driving a car. <SC>And on the other hand</SC> on the other side of the road, <F>erm</F> young guy is <SC>driving a bicycle</SC> <F>oh</F> no, I mean, <SC>driving a bike</SC> riding a bike, <SC>with the</SC> <F>er</F> <F>em</F> using the mobile phone. <F>Erm</F> <?>on sudden</?> <SC>they <F>em</F> hi</SC> they bumped each other. But the car driver said, <F>well</F> "That's <F>er</F> motorbike's fault. Because <SC>that driver</SC> that <F>er</F> rider was phoning. And they are <F>em</F> concentrating to phoning rather than driving.". So <F>er</F> <JP><F>eh</F></JP> <SC>the dri</SC> the car driver, <F>er</F> when they called to the police, <F>em</F> the car driver explained to the police. <F>Em</F> <F>well</F> we don't yet <F>well</F> <F>em</F> <SC>what's their co</SC> <R>what's</R> what's the conclusion <R>for</R> for it. But <F>er</F> the bike was <F>em</F> towed by <F>em</F> <F>ah</F> how could I say, <F>er</F> car <F>er</F> <SC>si</SC> <R>fi</R> fix manufacturer.<F>Um</F>. Yes, I have.<F>Oh</F>. <F>Er</F> the easiest way is <F>well</F> you go to the <F>er</F> <SC>driving school</SC> <F>well</F> driving license school and you can get minimum, I think, two month or something.<SC>And</SC> but in my case, it took two years to get the <F>er</F> license. Quite long time. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Well</F> because the always school teacher was very arrogant. And when I was <F>em</F> <R>when I</R> when I took the <F>er</F> a silence, I was <F>erm</F> very young. And so <F>er</F> when I went there, <F>em</F> I couldn't <SC>stand</SC> endure their arroganceness. And I didn't go to the school. That's why it took two years.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. But minimum is two month.<F>Erm</F> of course, you need a little bit of efforts to do <OL>it</OL>.But <F>em</F> <F>well</F> it's not so difficult to do it.<F>Well</F> of course, you have to pass the exam.I mean, reading and also <F>er</F> driving technique. But <F>em</F> if you go there, I mean, <SC>school teacher is not</SC> <F>well</F> how could I say, <F>er</F> <SC>school</SC> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I think the</SC> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I remember the figures but I think ninety percent of people <F>erm</F> got their license if they go to <R>s</R> <F>erm</F> schools.<F>Well</F> it's very heavy. <SC>I'm always <F>em</F></SC> even in Omiya. <F>Erm</F> <F>well</F> but that's also <SC>very difficult points</SC> <R>very contradict</R> contradictional points. Because <F>er</F> for family, I'd like to drive. But at the same time, I know it cause of the <F>er</F> traffic jams.So <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> <SC>when I</SC> <F>well</F> if I go to Omiya <SC>City</SC> <R>ce</R> center of city <SC>I should</SC> I think I should take a train rather than driving a car. But if I'm think about family, <laughter>always I <SC>drive</SC></laughter> driving. That's my problem.<CO>But</CO>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Well</F> first of all, I mean, <SC>I</SC> <F>well</F> from my point of view, I mean, <SC>this</SC> <F>erm</F> <SC>my</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> rider, I think that rider's fault. <SC>Be</SC> <F>well</F> if he is not so concentrate to talking through mobile phone, then, <F>well</F> they could escape this accident I think.<F>Mmm</F>.<F>Mmm</F><F>Well</F> <.></.> <R>I</R> I used to have the motorbike.And I gave up. Because <F>em</F> <F>well</F> <SC>my bo</SC> <F>well</F> someone always <F>er</F> broke something, I mean, at night. <F>Well</F> maybe <F>well</F> high school students or someone I didn't know. But <F>em</F> because very expensive to fix. That's why I gave up. But if my son said, <F>well</F> he is love to ride a bike, I would say O K. <R>Because</R> because <R>I</R> I loved it.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.<OL>Good</OL>. Thank you.<SC>I'm s</SC> <F>ah</F> <F>well</F> really but I have to go back to <F>er</F> Shin-okubo.<OL><??></??></OL>Yes. My base is Shin-okubo.<OL>But</OL> today, I got two meetings in Shibuya. So no problem to <OL>come here</OL>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
