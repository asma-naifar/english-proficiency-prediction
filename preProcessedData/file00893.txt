I found a nice shoes. And it was on sale.  thirty percent off. So  I really wanted to buy that. And so   I got it. And  after the shoes corner, I went to the  clothes corner. And I found  again  really nice shirts. And that was  fifty percent off. So I just  bought it. And  it was a really nice shopping for me.
