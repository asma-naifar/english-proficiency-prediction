O K. . O K. . She is a sales woman, of medicine. she works for a pharmaceutical company and, you know, in the pharmaceutical company, she is a sales woman so that is a very simple job, but it's very difficult for the sales person, I think. Because pharmaceutical very professional so it's difficult to explain to the doctor or pharmacy why the medicine is good or not.
. so that is very difficult but she know well and she succeeds in the point of the few years, actually sales. And her sales is very good and so in the point, I can respect her. .
