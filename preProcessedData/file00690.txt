. O K.  Near my home,  there is a . Yes.  . There is  famous school of sports. They have a strong club of rugby and soccer or something like that. So,   I think there is a little bit country so    we don't have  a lot of special thing there. So, that's all.
Yes.
.    I can't cook not  at all. So,  I can eats anything I want because my mother cooks very good.
 And so,   I don't have to be lonely with my family. So, it is good I think.
 .  I'm busy now because  I'm in recruit activity. So,  I don't have a lot of free time, but I'd like to go to  shopping in my free time.
.    I would go to Daikanyama or Shibuya or something like that.

I'd like to work in  mass communication company because  I like TV program, and  I don't like  closed space because anytime  I'd like to communicate with a lot of people, so I'd like to go to mass .

. There is seven o'clock. And  they have a party and a young man and women is  sitting at table and sommelier is  bringing a kind of wine. And the man   is tasting it. . The pianist is playing piano.  And  there is  some a couple, and   the man is trying to choose a wine. And  some  people is eating dinner  and the waiter is  saving  dishes.  That's all.
 I usually go to family restaurant.
. I like Saizeria because foods is very cheap  and taste good.
Yes. 
  I think that's was on  May of this year  because of anniversary of marriage of my parents. So,  we went to   Hotel New Otani, it's restaurant. I think that was my last time.
Good.
.
I think the difference is     the hotel's restaurant is a very formal, so we have to go to   there with formal suits or dresses, but the family restaurant is a very casual, so we can go there with   rough clothes, so and  the mood of   shop is very difference from family restaurant to  hotel's restaurant I think.
