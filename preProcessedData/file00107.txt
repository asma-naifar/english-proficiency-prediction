 I like listen to music.
I am  crazy about  sixty's and seventy's black music.

. I love Led Zeppelin  and Pink Floyd.  . .  .  .
. Before I was born, my mother  played the record, the late songs of the Beatles. So  I got to like that.

.
 I think   rock music   was at it's best in sixties and seventies. So  I like rock music, so I chose seventies.  So  I don't think contemporary rock music is not rock.

.  Perhaps, they think of me as old fashion and a kind of  weird person. . Yes.
.  is different from  others, so  that's all.
Yes, I live with your family.
I live in  in  near to .
. My parents are very strict. So   I couldn't  live  by myself.
I feel sorry for that. But,  as for me, I  couldn't and can't afford to live by myself. So   all I can do is depend on  them,  yeah, financially. .
  psychologically, also.
 Yes. .  . Parents have  some rules   as long as   I can do that. As long   as I can  make it by myself,  they allow me to do that. But  others are not.
There  six guests in a restaurant, and  there also two waiters and  pianist.   in each table, two couples  is sitting and having a dinner. And  one waiter is serving    wine to  a couple. And the other is serving a  dish. I guess expensive. And   they look like happy    while enjoying dinner.
No, I don't  so much.
With friends?  . As for me,    hang around I rather  spend my time  alone.
At home or outside.
I like to walk without reason or  purposes. I wander and  , yes. Sometimes, I walk with my dog.
 .    people tend to  find or     set reason or purpose for walking  like for health, for shopping or  something like that. But, as for me, I have     nothing. Just walking.
Yes. .  I  made a reservation  on the reserved car in a train. But I missed the train. So  I'd like you to  pay back or exchange another new one.
Yes, I know that. But  I   actually paid the money for one ticket.   but,  actually,  I didn't get it on. So   I think I have right    to  get a  seat.
 

 . 
  because I    got on taxi, but   there was a traffic jam to the station.  But I have     to go to the place because   my grandfather is dying.
So I really was in hurry.

 Thank you. 

Yes.
I went to Hiroshima  by  express train.
  I went sightseeing and visit my friend.  actually,  she is now in . .
 What I did together?  .  I talked a lot because  the   place she lives in   is very  rural and away from the city because  the department she belongs to   is located in that. So   I couldn't anything but talk with her or walk around the field. So,  after I left her home, I   tour around   the Hiroshima City, like museum, temples, dome.
Yeah.
One day last week, a woman went shopping in a department store. She wanted  to  buy a new tie.  I guess  the gift for her husband because    she looked old enough to have a husband or family. .  She decided     with      yellow and green tie. .    she paid money for that and          asked the person  who works in department store  where she should go  to  the third floor. He kindly  told that, and    she could find   the stairs to  the third floor.
