Nice to meet you.
. My name is .
Yeah.
. I live in  city in .
No. . I'm from Tokushima in Shikoku.
Yeah. But    I went to university in  prefecture, and  then, I know the  area quite well. Then, after university, I came back to my hometown and worked little bit and went to U K studied. Then, came back to my hometown, then again, I came to .
In U K? It's about three years. .   I visited three times. And university?
 I visited once. I stayed there for a month.
Yeah. This was the first experience in U K, and I was just fascinated by U K.  then, I did some kind of  working experience. Then, after two years,  after working, then, I visited U K and stayed there for about  eight months and run out of money, then came back, then worked again, then went back, then stayed there for about two years.
Working as well. Part-time .
U K?
Yeah. Many people ask me.
I don't know.  it's very difficult to explain. Because, yeah, how can I say,  Britain is a very mature country compared to Japan, of course. And   yeah, people are really attract as well. And  there is a established democracy there.
 I just like it.
My hobby? .  Drinking. 
I like drinking a lot.
How much?
Yeah. . . .
A day?
A night? I don't know.   do you know pints? Do you know ?
Two pints . Two pints and changed to  another alcohol   I don't know, such as Shotyu or something like that. Then, half bottle of Shotyu, or I don't know.

How ?
At the moment, I don't have  enough money, so  once a month, like that.

All right. . There is a house, and,  in front of a house, a girl is playing. And I can see  yeah, no, three dogs and a cat on the car. And  children are playing as well. Housewives are talking on the street, and a man is reading a newspaper. And a guy is running, enjoying jogging.
Good health? Me?
 Sleeping, maybe. 
Sports? I don't have any time at the moment.   no sports. I just take  good sleep and take  .
  little bit walking.
Yeah.
Yeah.    quick walking, yeah instead of  riding bicycles.
.
Me?
It's a  good neighborhood, but   I like living in a small apartment    not like 
big city. . For me,  comfortable. . And, how can I say, this is a  house and house neighborhood.
And   lot of communications going on.
And,  this maybe,  quite suburb area, yeah. . I don't know.  How can I explain?
This one?
 . O K. Maybe,  a  quite middle class family living in this house and  enjoying quite good life. And wife is working, and  and husband works very hard and children, yeah. At the moment, I can imagine of that kind of  living.
O K.
Yeah.
.
All right.  . I live in apartment.
. O K, O K.
Yeah.
. I have a trouble because when I came back, then,  my window was broken.
. And I don't know what to do. And  no, I  locked my door, yeah.  I'm sure. But I think that something happened. And, maybe, I don't know, someone broke into my house. Then,  I just saw the window is broken. Then, I don't know  what to do. ?
My room?
?        just window was broken.
 but there were nothing which was stolen.
That's good.
. But   I didn't think quite well.
 .
O K. So, O K.  I'll call you back later.
And, after checking my stuff, then, yeah, I'll check my stuff, yeah. 
 .
. Yeah.
.  First time, I homestayed.
 second time, I homestayed.
Then, how can I say, I just rent the room of just kind of landlord. There's a landlord, then I just rent the room and stayed there. And,  next, I shared the house. There, I stayed with three people,  and landlord is living another place.
I just shared a house.
  that's no problem at all because  I think people in foreign countries  are very used to living with  different people.
 that is very different from Japanese people.
Because Japanese people don't like sharing. I think don't like sharing with kitchens, bathroom, they don't like. They just like  using themselves. But, yeah, as I said, foreign people have  basic manners to  share things with  different people.
. Yeah. And,     when there  are troubles, you just say, and I just said.
  communicated.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
" one day last week"? Yeah. And ends at sixth. O K.  there is me?
Could be anyone? All right. O K. One day last week, my sister  opened the refrigerator, and  she realized there was nothing there. And she went out and shopping at supermarket and bought many things. Maybe,  she was thinking about having a party something with  her friends, yeah, and  paid everything, maybe, by cash. Then, she put everything in the car, and she just started cooking, maybe, was thinking about having parties .
By car? . Because  you don't need to carry heavy bags or many bags. Just go there and buy stuff and put everything   in the back of the car.
Yeah. I used to. But, here, I don't have car. . When I was hometown because it's a hometown, not a city.  transportation is not . . Yeah.
Yeah. So   no,  I used to drive a car, but, here, I don't drive.
Yeah.   I did, yeah,  
yeah, just like that. 
.  compact. It's like that. Compact car.
A thousand C C. I don't know how to say a thousand C C.  it's not big car.
Watch. 
Buy the car?
. Because, as I just said, transportation is not convenient and   not frequent bus, no frequent train.
And   not many shops near my house. And  there are good restaurants and good cafes, good   supermarkets in the suburb, yeah. So just people  living in a  rural areas.
  they just have to  take cars, maybe.
Compact car? . Because I just can't drive a big car.  It's   really difficult.
Big car is a driver? No.  at driving school,
People have to ride in a big car, and then, I had a big trouble.   I don't know sense.
You know, sense.
Yeah.  yeah, sense of a big car.
 . .
. 
.
My plan? Work, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. At the moment, I changed my work style recently.
Yeah. I used to be working from nine to six just ordinary works time. But  I just quit  that, then, I do at home.
.  and   I am paid by what I've done, yeah.  and also,  I'm studying at two times in a week. Then,  so, these days, I can't study. So I just have to work  weekend.
.
Thank you very much. You too.
