.
 my name is .
.
  to tell the truth,  I feel bad this morning because     the condition of my stomach is not so good. And in addition, I tend to be,  anemia recently. And   this morning in the train,  I feel pain and come to throw up. However,  I didn't throw up, but,  I feel very bad in the train. .
And this ,
  I had to attend the first class, the very first class,    so  was very  tired. 
.
 now. ,
 now, I'm very nervous. 
.
. I live in  City.
 it's  on the line of  . And,  my house is  far from fifteen minutes  walk from the station. . . And,    in my town, there is not so many building.       there are many  houses. .
. No.  I'm a sophomore of
 literature.
.     about this university,    I like    in this university,   there are many  kinds of people and there are many kinds of circle.   I belonged to the circle. Now I don't belong, but  this circle was  very enjoyable circle for me, and  I think it's very good experience to meet many kinds of people, and to have the same experience  with many kinds of people.   sometimes,  I felt  troublesome,  and  to  with them was very difficult for me. But,  after I experienced  that, I think,    is  good for a having  many kinds of people and having many kinds of circle.
But,       this becomes the bad point for .  what I want to say that    some of my friend said to me,   "After I entered this university,  I come to think I don't know what to do.     it's too big for me, and   there are many people for me. So I can't   understand  with whom  I come to be friend with.    I don't know what I want to do.". .
So  some of my friend     came to be dangerous mental situation .
.
.
.
.
.  .     there are many people  in some hall,  and      it maybe like some restaurant,  and one of the woman  is playing the piano, and the time was seven o'clock, and   one host  step up   to the customers and  recommend to drink the wine. . And,    in this picture,  except these people, there are two couples. And    seem to feel   joy to have some  same experience.  and I think this hall is too big for  these people.  maybe, usually,  in some restaurant,     they are crowded, but    in this hall,    it seems very   empty.    and it's at night. .
.
. I don't like the restaurant because   if I go to the restaurant,  I have to   behave   with good manners.     it  me.  and to tell the truth,     when I eat,   in my house, I'm not so good manners,  I feel pressure.

However,   I heard that   some resident  said to my mother that  the stealer  come to her house, but she live on the first floor,  and  the lock of the window was broken,  and   they were stolen many things.

One day last week,   I and two boys    expect that  the next day  will become rainy,       so we thought that we can't    do the our plan. .   however,          we think the situation about   the sunny day.   If  it will be sunny,  we will     go to see the movie. And,    we will eat popcorn or   coke.  and in the movie,  there  occurred the  airplane accident. . But,  we enjoyed the movie very much,  and after the  movie,  we will  be very  happy.  we imagine the situation. . .  .
