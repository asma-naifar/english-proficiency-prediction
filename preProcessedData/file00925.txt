  . Very confusing question.   because  I like eating sweets and  I think    making sweets by myself is more cheaper   than buying them so   I decided to learn cooking, but    recently  I have been eating sweets too much, so I have to go on a diet.

No?   it is a scene of a restaurant. And there are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight people in the restaurant. . Sorry nine people in the restaurant. And look at  this scene.    there are two couple sitting on their chairs and  I think   they are ordering something,  maybe  I think  drink.     and a waiter is asking       which alcohol  do they drink. And  I think  he is recommending them  a bottle of wine.    and the waiter and the man are talking  about drinking.   and  there is a woman who is playing the piano.  I don't know  which kind of music she plays but      I think   the kind of music is classic.    there is a  big clock in the restaurant and the time is eight clock  at night.

No?   I like Jonnasan.  Jonnasan is a restaurant  which I usually go.  it's a kind of family restaurant and  there is a special service in Jonasan and the service was drink bar and salad bar.    do you hear that name? Drink bar and salad bar?

Yes.   black suit is  very useful because    I can wear this   suit for  every purpose,  for example  a party and   funeral.  do you understand me?
And  seminar and    wedding party.
Sure? And so on.
Yeah.
 O K.
. Yes.   one day  a boy and a girl   were   walking on the road and the weather was raining.  very hard rain. And        sorry    they are talking  with each other. And  a few minutes later   a man was  stopped and said to her,   "     there is  sound. Please listen.".    and    near the pole  they found  little   brown cat   and   they rushed to the cat and    picked the cat up.  she said,  "Poor cat.".  and he also said,  "I think so, too.". And      she said to the man,  "  may I take this cat to our house?".   at fist he was embarrassed    but he was thinking and at last      he permitted her to take the cat to their house  and she was very happy. And then   a man and a   girl was    walking again to their house  with their cat.
 I like cats  but  my mother and father don't like cats. So  I think the cat was very poor but  I don't do the same. Yes.
 maybe.      or      maybe  I'll take the cat to the police and ask the police to find  someone who is willing to have a cat.

Thank you very much.
