Et cetera.

So
I stay my friend's home.

 O K.
. It is winter. And this is ski . And  many many people there.   childrens are throwing some snow balls. . Snowman  is near there. And in the lodge, one couple is drinking a tea. And the other people is skiing. On the lift, no person.   It is beautiful behind the trees.
 Skiing.
. For me?
   I rarely ski.  My experience is one or two times
to ski.
  I have played by skate board
when I was a child. So I think it is more difficult to ski than snowboarding.
Excuse me?
I'm looking for some clothes.
 Do you think which one is best for me?
.  So black one, please.
I have no idea about material. But design is the simple one is best.
  . Is there another simple one?
 No reason, but I don't like it very much.
How much is it?
. Little expensive for me. . But I like it. So please this one.
.
Cash, please.
 . For me,  to go alone.
Because
If  I go there with my friend,
 very  irritate for me.
  I  my friend always.
So to be alone is   very preferable for me.
 . So price is not very important thing. 
 No. No. No. No. Because  I usually buy the cheaper clothes.
O K.  One day last week, I went to restaurant with my father. .    the restaurant was   for rich person. . The shop was not crowded.     I asked clerk beer and salmon. And my father asked  juice and  fried chicken. . My father  pay the bill. And     very pleasurable for me.  And then    my father had a job after this restaurant. And I go back home. So I said good bye to my father.
 I rarely go to restaurant. . Usually go to  shop.
  so this seemed rich and clear.
.   is the best food.  low price and   I have no idea, but
 is anyway  low price.
.  The other one is Yoshinoya or Matsuya.
 Anyway reasonable.
.  Yoshinoya and Matsuya?
.  Price is not so different. But if  Matsuya    
do you know? . Like a consomme soup is
setted. And Matsuya is only .
 I like Matsuya.
.    Matsuya is   the waiter ask the menu is  by vending machine. . Yoshinoya is ask clerk directly. So  there is no need to talk with clerk.
Maybe  I go back home. But   the lounge of the circle is near there. So  I might go there for a moment, and go back my home.
. Good bye.
