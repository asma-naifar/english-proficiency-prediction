   story.  This story is very difficult.

Sorry.
Yes.       the man and the woman      are skiing  slowly together.
    and           no, no, no,        a children     threw  snow balls. .      fight.
And        in the  cottage, I think,  the man and woman   drink  green tea or coffee
together.
Skating. .   I think     skiing is   a  sports     on the snow. And  skating  is the sport on  ice.    and           in skiing, we use   ski board and in skating,     we use   skating shoes,
I think.      and     the     professional  player  is very     beautiful.
     I think   skating is beautiful  but      skiing is   powerful.
