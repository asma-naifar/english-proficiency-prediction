 . Yeah. 
Yes, I did.
 . What was it? Japanese noodle.
. Actually, I work at the headquarter. It's not here. And we have our restaurant at the basement floor. So I usually eat there. 
. Very big difference there. this building here is called Y O G, Yamanouchi Office Garden. And it's pretty new. It's made three years ago or so. 
It's pretty huge, convenient place, especially, I live very close here.
I can walk here. So I also was working here at the information system department which is located here at Y O G.
So I was walking to the office every day. But now, I take the train for about an hour. It's very inconvenient.
Yeah, I hope . but I moved the department so I couldn't work here.
.
 . Since I'm Japanese, 
and the Christmas is always in the office hour or something. we work on the Christmas season. So we will have a cake or give the present to my son,
and daughter and that's all.
 in the apartment.
 whatever they want. I'm not choosing, they choose. So doesn't matter whatever it is.

 hopefully next month, I would like to go to Guam.
 planning to go to Guam.
 . Do you know what root beer is?
 I think it's famous in the United States.
. It's like a Doctor Pepper. you know the Doctor Pepper?
Yes. . It's non-alcoholic a kind of beer. taste little bit different from the beer. It's a little bit like Doctor Pepper. so, what should we call, it's ginger taste,
 medicine taste.
It's not that good with the hamburger shop, served in the very big mug for free. So that was pretty exciting, I mean that was first experience for me to, have that, like that way. 
 it's not popular in Japan I used to live in the States about twenty five years ago.
It was famous there .
. My father 's business.
I did this last time. 
 . It's in the classroom. I this picture not written by Japanese. It's very Western, I think. . No, but school it is like Japanese style. So, you know, I'm not sure. But anyway, this is picture of the classroom. A teacher teaching in mathematics to the students. Some are studying. And most of them not. they don't look at the pictures. they're not concentrated. That's all.
 some are , some are even not sitting on their own seat. And the others are something drinking, and even not looking at the front. So that's the reason.
 after this, you mean?
. What will happen? I have no idea.
? .
 what's the ideal?
 what was it? Could you ?
 for myself, you mean? . It's really hard question. . Good teacher for me. my first boss might be the one of my best teacher. . he work really hard in here. I was yeah, representative for the first time. And also was he was pretty aged, was over fifty. he's very listen to our opinions even just enter the company, very young who doesn't know well about the sales persons. . even like those kind of people's opinion, good ear. I mean, really he did listen to the younger's opinion. And he usually let us do whatever we wanted to do, yeah, on our way it's not unlegal things or . 
So I think he was a very good leader and maybe I can call him a teacher, I think.

. then I'll leave this here, receipt and the product, and my phone number here. So could you ask him to call me back when he come back?
. that's fine. And when will he back?
Two weeks. Pretty long time.
 anyway, I'll wait, then. so please ask him to call again.
Thank you.

 I didn't try hard. 
Now?
