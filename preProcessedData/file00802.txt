Yeah. My name is .
Yes, please.
 . Actually, it's not so good. I caught a cold.
 . Yeah. 
Yes, I did.
  . What was it? Japanese noodle.
. Actually, I work at the   headquarter. It's not here. And we have our   restaurant at the basement floor. So I usually eat there. 
. Very big difference there.      this building here is called Y O G, Yamanouchi Office Garden.  And it's pretty new. It's made three years ago or so. 
It's pretty huge, convenient place,  especially, I live very close  here.
I can walk  here. So   I also was working here at the      information system department   which is located here at Y O G.
So I was walking  to the office every day. But now, I take the train for about an hour. It's very inconvenient.
Yeah, I hope .    but I moved the department so I couldn't   work here.
.
   . Since I'm Japanese, 
and the Christmas is always in the office hour or something.  we work on  the Christmas season.  So   we will have a cake    or give the present to my son,
and daughter  and that's all.
 we have Christmas  in the apartment.
  whatever they want.    I'm not choosing,  they choose. So doesn't matter whatever it is. 
.    I like traveling around.  And last month, I  took  a few days off and went to Okinawa.
 hopefully next month, I would like to go to Guam.
 planning to go to Guam.
 . Do you know what root beer is?
 I think it's famous in the United States.
. It's  like a Doctor Pepper.  you know the Doctor Pepper?
Yes. .  It's  non-alcoholic  a kind of beer.  taste   little bit different from the beer. It's a little bit like  Doctor Pepper.    so,   what should we call, it's ginger taste,
 medicine taste.
It's not that good . But it served   with the hamburger shop, served  in the  very big mug for free.  So that was pretty exciting, I mean that was first experience for me to,  have that, like that way. 
.    I used to live in the States   about  twenty five years ago.
It was famous there .
. My father 's business.
I did this last time. 
 . It's in the classroom.  I  this picture not written by Japanese.  It's  very Western, I think.  . No, but  school  to the students. Some are studying. And most of them not.    they don't look at the pictures.  they're not concentrated.  That's all.
.  some are , some are even not sitting on  their own seat. And the others are   chewing gums, having  something drinking, and even   not looking at the front. So that's the reason.
  after this, you mean?
.   What will happen?  I'm not sure.  I have no idea.
? .
.  what's the ideal?
 what was it? Could you ?
 for myself, you mean?   . It's really hard  question. . Good teacher for me.    after I enter this company,  my first boss   might be the one of my best teacher. .   he work really hard in here.  I was  yeah,   representative  for the first time. And  of course   also was . And  he was pretty aged, was over fifty.   but      he's very   listen to our opinions   even    the people like us who  just enter the company, very   young   who doesn't know well about the sales persons. .  even like those kind of people's opinion,  he had a  good ear. I mean, really he did listen to   the   younger's opinion. And he usually let us do  whatever we wanted to do, yeah,   on our way  it's not unlegal things or . 
So  I think he was a very good leader and   maybe   I can call him a teacher, I think.

. 

No.
  O K.
 yes. I bought this yesterday.   and since I didn't like it,    first this   was not a bad thing but  it's not  I just change my mind and I would like you to change this or I  give this back to you.
.  I have a receipt here, too. And it's just yesterday.     I won't say just  give you back,  I would like to change   to the other things.
Yes.
 Yeah. . Is there anyone who is not a part  time worker here ?
.  then  is there any way to  contact him today or now?
.  then  I'll leave this here, receipt and the product,  and my phone number here. So could you ask him to call me back  when  he come back?
.  that's fine. And  when will he back?
Two weeks. Pretty long time.
 anyway, I'll wait, then.  so  please ask him to call again.
Thank you.
Bye.
.
 I didn't try hard. 
Now?
  . I didn't make the situation   realistic  situation in my mind. I didn't make anything,    what product it was, what kind of shops this was.    so I couldn't push   too hard.
.

I was very, very young,  I was in the elementary school. I mean, I was only eight years old. So,
    what do I remember?  I forgot most of things.
 first time to smoke a cigarette. 
I mean,  you know,     we didn't have to hide. But actually, I was hiding  behind the trees. And   someone just throw the   cigarettes to the  ground, right?  do we just ran back, take back to  and just tried to smoke. That's all.
 right. At that time, .
 I smoke  a lot now.

. One day last week,      no? No?  girls.  I went   the  picnic   with my girl.    we went to the mountainside and  making tents  set up,  having barbecue cooking start. And all of a sudden,   the rain start falling. What is it?  .   But   the first,   yeah, rain, that wasn't that hard.    but all the sudden, it  became like a   thunderstorm. So we  give up  staying here. And came, then   found a hotel to stay.  .  But it was a good experience. 
Yes, I do.
 I don't know.  I'm too used to it. So it's fine.

bumped to my car. That's all. 
 . It was  cross way. . . But   I was stopping.  And the sudden the   cycle,  I think he didn't see the front. He just bumped to my car.
He flew over my bonnet.  And I took him  I call the  ambulance. That's all. 
 . . He was O K. .    he said he  will  never ride   the bike  again.
   .  don't just look on the front.    or see all the mirrors any time you drive.
.  yeah?
