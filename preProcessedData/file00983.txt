Maybe last week, I guess. I went <?>there</?> some <F>er</F> wine restaurant with a friend.You know, <F>er</F> O K, I like a Australia or California winewhich is <SC>very</SC> <F>er</F> a little bit <F>er</F> different from French or Italian one.I think it's <SC>more</SC> very <F>er</F> <JP>nandaro</JP> <F>er</F> thick or dense. Very <F>er</F> heavy and <F>er</F> fruity. So I like red wine. But <F>er</F> <SC>I think</SC> <F>er</F> there are <F>er</F> <SC>not a mu</SC> not a many restaurant who had Australian wine,in Tokyo. But <F>er</F> in Aoyama, actually, <F>er</F> there is a Australian wine bar.It's really nice. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah. You better go. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.O K. <F>Er</F>. It's a picture <SC>sh</SC> <F>er</F> of a kind of scenery. <F>Er</F> it seems like a uptown. And <F>er</F> I can see a house in the middle of the picture. And <F>er</F> <R>above</R> above the sky, <F>er</F> there is a sun <laughter>smiling</laughter>.Very <F>er</F> <R>ki</R> <JP>nandaro</JP> kind of cartoon, I guess. And <F>er</F> in front of the house, <F>er</F> <.></.> three childrens are playing. Two boys are maybe <F>er</F> playing with a ball. And the one girl is, I don't know how to call it, but <F>er</F> <OL><laughter>jumping</laughter></OL>,kind of <F>er</F> exercise. And the two dogs also are facing each other in front of the house. On the road, <F>er</F> I can see a white car, and <F>er</F> over <laughter>the</laughter> top of the car,is it cat or dog? But some animal is sleeping.And <F>er</F> enjoying sunlight, I guess. And the two ladies just in front of the car are really dangerous, I guess.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Two women are having <F>er</F> some <F>er</F> talk. And <F>er</F> one lady just having a dog. <F>Oh</F> there are too many dogs <OL><laughter>here</laughter></OL>.And <F>er</F> the across of the house, <F>er</F> I can see another house a little bit, part of a house, <SC>i</SC> actually. And in front of the house, there is a chair and <F>er</F> I think he is the father? <nvs>laughter</nvs> He is reading a news book, and <F>er</F> he is very quiet.And <F>er</F> <SC>I can see some</SC> <F>ah</F> there is a man. <nvs>laughter</nvs> He is most active in this picture. He is <F>er</F> wearing blue and <F>er</F> running. I don't know why <F>er</F> but <F>er</F> maybe for exercise <laughter><JP>teiuka</JP></laughter> for diet or something. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Er</F>.<OL>O K</OL>? <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<F>Well</F>.There are too few <laughter>house</laughter>.<SC>Very</SC> <F>er</F> I can see more green. <F>Well</F> actually I mean, I live in <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>.<OL>So</OL> compared to Tokyo, it's <F>er</F> more like <F>er</F> not so <SC>many</SC> <F>er</F> kind of busy town.

But <laughter>suddenly</laughter>, it was a storm or typhoon. And <F>em</F> all the stuffs are just crushed and <F>er</F> just blown away. So we just <F>er</F> went into the car. And <F>er</F> escaped from the river. And <F>er</F> <F>wow</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> to make it worse, <F>er</F> there was a thunder. So we couldn't go back to <SC>the</SC> our house. Because <F>er</F> there was some accident on the road. And <F>er</F> we couldn't go any further. But <F>er</F> very fortunately, we have just found us a <R>so</R> some hotel, Hotel Cosmos. And <F>er</F> very luckily, <F>er</F> we had a vacant room. And <F>er</F> lastly, <F>er</F> we could have a very <F>er</F> nice <F>er</F> black coffee. And in the very safe room.But <SC>i</SC> actually it was a haunted mansion. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Maybe at the seventh picture. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>Thank you very much</OL>.Actually, I don't. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Well</F>.
