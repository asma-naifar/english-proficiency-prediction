Hello.    would you like to   go to movie together on Sunday?
    I want to see     "Piano Lesson".
So  how do you think about it?
Good?  so  let's go. And   how about  the    time  to meet?   I suggest  one o'clock is best time to go to the movie.
.      so how do you think it,   I will   go to your house by car and I'll pick you up.
So I will go to your house at twelve o'clock 
 and movie will begin at one o'clock.
 So   it is good?
O K.
See you.
Yeah, .
. Last time I watched,       Jim Carrey,
   .  It was comedy and very funny. But    I thought not just comedy,
    it has lot thing  I  want to think about  that.
.    ?
 The movie?
  it was  almost funny, but  it was just serious, I think. Because   Jim Carrey was  main person and    in him,  there are two person in him and  he's troubled. And,   he want to seek   himself, truth.   I thought it  is  related with  identification.
So it was  interesting for me.
Yes.
Yes.
O K. One day last week,   they are  couple and they are walking together in rainy day. And     there's a box and,   some sound  is coming from box. So the man notice that, and  he said,  "Can you hear something?". And woman  found a box and   opened it.     and she found the cat.   she said, "Maybe  she  is lost.  Someone  throw her.". And she says, "I want this cat. I want to take this cat to our home.".  but the man  is thinking how should we do.     he said, "  we can't  take her back  to home because  we're poor.".  but she said, "But    I don't want to leave her here because she's very   poor.".     so he     admitted her  . So at last,   they went their home with cat together.
.
Yes.
In ,     my family have a dog.    he is  white terrier and his name is Jimmy.   I can't remember how old is he, but   maybe seven years old or  so. .
?
No. Now I live in  and  he lives with my family  in .
  I like it because  it's my dog, my family  have more conversation  and smooth  relationship. And     I think,  we are getting closer.   not just for  our dog, but  we are happy  with him.
.
  I'm coming here with my friend. And     not we  talked about what we will do after this test. I want to go,   Kichijoji or Shimokitazawa  for  pleasure,
 after this test.
Yeah, yes.
