Yes.     I think this is the  mathematics class. And  the teachers      using the blackboard. But  many of the students doesn't   hear the teacher.  someone is  talking each other and someone is chewing gum. And someone is   drinking  and listening to the music. But only one  student is  listening to the  teacher.
 . That's all.
.
.   in my experience   in my high school days,   almost the students     is listening to the teacher carefully. And every student  studied very hard.
So, atmosphere is very different from this situation.
