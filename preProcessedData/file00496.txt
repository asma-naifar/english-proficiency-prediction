Fine thank you, and you?<OL>Yes, very</OL> humid. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uum</F>. I have <R>no choice</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> no choice.<F>Urr</F>. I have no choice, but <F>er</F> I try to go outfor walking.Because I think <F>er</F> sweating is better to my health.<OL><??></??></OL>.<JP><F>Ee</F></JP>. Usually, I go out <R>once a day</R>once a day <F>ur</F> for about thirty minutes to one hour.Yes. <F>Err</F>. After that, I usually take a shower. <SC>And</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> so I feel very relaxing.I <F>er</F> live <F>ur</F> in <F>err</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> district of <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> ward.As you know <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> ward is <F>ur</F> located in southern part of <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is, I can say, <F>ur</F> typical residential area <R>near</R> near the <R><H pn="others4">XXX06</H> River</R> <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> River. So I can enjoy nice view of <H pn="others5">XXX07</H>.Almost every day, especially in the morning, over the <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> River.<F>Er</F> walking. <F>Err</F> I <JP><F>ee</F></JP> go out for walking <F>ur</F> usually on the bank of the <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> because there are a lot of <F>ur</F> <R>greenish</R> greenish space, not crowded. <.></.> So <R>I</R> I could <R>walk</R> walk.On the bank of the river.<OL>Yes</OL>. I live <F>er</F> <F>err</F> with my wife. There is only two people because <F>ur</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> only daughter married <SC>seven years</SC> yeah, seven years ago.<OL><F>Uum</F> <laughter>it's very difficult</laughter></OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Err</F> she is <F>ur</F> sixty-two years old. <F>Err</F>. I think she is a typical housewife. She hasn't have <F>ur</F> any job outside. But <F>ur</F> <R>she</R> <F>er</F> she has controlled to watch over the household. <.></.> <R>So</R> <F>er</F> so she <F>er</F> likes <R>tra</R> travel especially overseas.So <??></??> <.></.> traveling overseas I have to do everything. <nvs>laughter</nvs><laughter>At home it's very troublesome to me</laughter>. So <R>I</R> I <F>ur</F> <SC>complain</SC> always complain. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<F>Uh-huh</F>.So <F>er</F> this is a not usual <F>er</F> school because <F>er</F> <F>urr</F> there are many kind of <F>err</F> people. Young girl <R>and</R> <F>ur</F> and also the middle aged. <F>Err</F> man and woman. <SC>So</SC> and also, it is school <SC>something</SC> <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> or something like <F>err</F> culture or life-long education. So I think <SC>this teacher <F>er</F> is not so</SC> <F>err</F> it's very difficult for teacher <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to control the classroom because <F>ur</F> <SC?>mister</SC?> middle-aged person cannot follow the study. And <F>ur</F> some ladies is chatting each other. So <.></.> <SC>the</SC> on the board, some <F>ur</F> <R>mathematics</R> mathematics. Very <F>ur</F> difficult to know clearly what kind of school.<OL><R>Maybe</R></OL> maybe <F>ur</F> some culture school.<F>Uhm</F>.Yeah. So she has to ask <F>ur</F> students to follow the rules. <JP><F>Ee</F></JP>. As a student, otherwise <.></.> she can ask them to go out classroom. Otherwise <F>er</F> <F>er</F> near good students can not study, so she has to severe for the rules. And <F>er</F> sometimes, she has to prepare some disciplineto that <F>ur</F> troublesome students.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. Still I remember.<F>Ummm</F>.Yeah. <SC>I</SC> I'm not sure <R>the</R> the present situation. <F>Err</F>. But <F>ur</F> sometimes, I <JP><F>ee</F></JP> heard any kind of troubles. So <F>err</F> I think <.></.> this is quite different because <F>ur</F> in my school days, <F>ur</F> we have to follow the rules. And <F>ur</F> we <F>ur</F> respect the teacher. <F>Err</F>. I used to be scolded by teacher. But <F>ur</F> this also, <?>another words</?> <F>err</F> good experience for me. But, nowadays, school <F>er</F> is in a chaos. Some boy <R>cannot sit</R>cannot sit in the <F>ur</F> studies. And also, some are <??></??> all the students.Even some violence <??></??> the class room. So, <.></.> <laughter>this my opinion</laughter> <F>err</F>. <.></.> Ministry of Education have to proceed <SC>the</SC> <.></.> how to <F>er</F> improve the school education for the many kinds of person from many fields <OL>advise</OL>.Yes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> Thank you very much</OL>.Yes, I do.Yes.Yes.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Err</F>.

And <F>ur</F> I have to <R>send her</R> send her hospital <F>err</F> to stay <F>ur</F> hospital <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to wait.Sorry. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Because <F>ur</F> I'm in a panic.

But, <F>err</F> maybe, <SC>they're</SC> <R>they</R> <R>they were not so happy</R>.They were not so happy.So, <.></.> sometimes, I also <F>er</F> <..></..> confused <SC>which is</SC> <.></.> which was <F>ur</F> more important. So one way is I <F>er</F> left my wife to the hospitalto the doctor, and I should go to the party,because of the <F>err</F> many kind of <.></.> situation. <??></??>.<OL><??></??></OL>.<OL>Last week</OL>.Short story.So <F>er</F> this two <F>urr</F> person is <F>ur</F> <.></.> on the way back <R>to</R> to their home. <SC>They come</SC> they came to <F>er</F> see the some <F>ur</F> cats is left <.></.> in the box. So <.></.> the girl insisted to bring back <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to <F>er</F> take care of this cat. But <F>ur</F> this <F>ur</F> boy, <F>err</F> <SC>she</SC> <F>er</F> he didn't agree with her. But <F>er</F> <R>sh</R> she strongly insisted <.></.> to bring back and take care. So, maybe, he <R>compromised</R> compromised. So <SC>they are</SC> they decided to bring up this cat to their house.<F>Err</F>. At the moment, <R>I</R> <F>err</F> I haven't <OL>it</OL>.But, the last time, because I like <F>err</F> dog and cats.
