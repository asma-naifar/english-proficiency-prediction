<F>Mh-hmm</F>. Good morning. <F>Um</F> I'm <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sure.<F>Er</F> I'm a little tiredbecause I've been so busy these days.<F>Oh</F> especially working.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hmm</F> yes. It's better <R>to</R> <F>er</F> to have <SC>good weather</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>be</SC> warm weather. But <F>er</F> <SC>not</SC> it doesn't help a lot. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Hm</F>.Yes. Really good place.Yes.Because <F>er</F> new subway <F>er</F> just <F>er</F> came into operation<OL>two years ago</OL>.<OL>And then</OL> <F>mm</F> I can go anywhere quite easily. <F>Er</F> so it's very, very convenient.<F>Hm</F>.Yes. <F>Er</F> there are two famous parks. One is <F>er</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And the other is <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And both of then are very, very good because there are so many green trees and flowers in the spring. And <F>er</F> we can just go and visit and feel relax. And <F>uh</F> also there is a museum and a museum park. So it's a very nice museum because the building <F>er</F> was built, I think <F>er</F> <F>eh</F> at the very beginning of the twentieth century.And it's a very nice <F>er</F> building.So I like my area very much.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Er</F> I like to <F>er</F> listening to C D's.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Er</F> Japanese pop music.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes.No.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL>. I think <F>um</F> basically same because <SC>al</SC> most of the Japanese <F>mm</F> pop musicians try to imitate <F>er</F> the way of <F>er</F> playing or singing of the Western singers. So it's <R>m</R> <F>er</F> mostly I think about the same. But <F>mm</F> big difference is language.<R>O</R> <SC>o</SC> <F>mm</F> <laughter>because</laughter> of course a lot of Japanese singers sing in Japanese. So that's a <nvs>laughter</nvs> big difference. So I mean the words are <F>er</F> different. But as far as the music is concerned, it's very similar, I guess.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.Yeah.<F>Oh</F> yeah, not a big problem for me. But <F>er</F> I like <F>er</F> Western <F>er</F> or especially American music <F>er</F> in the seventies<OL><?>and</?></OL> eighties. <laughter>That means</laughter> at that time I was very young. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Hm</F>. O K. This is a classroom of a high school and this is a class of mathematics. And I think a teacher is teaching mathematics. However, <F>er</F> only one student <F>uh</F> in the front row is <nvs>laughter</nvs> studying. But other students are not listening <F>er</F> her lecture. <F>Er</F> one <laughter><SC?>man</SC?> boy who looks very old</laughter>, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>um</F> he is chewing gum. And two girls are chatting. And he is <F>er</F> drinking <F>er</F> something <F>er</F> <SC>while listening</SC> <F>er</F> he's listening to music with his <F>er</F> Walkman. And <SC>she i</SC> this girl is <F>er</F> using her cellphone.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>. <F>Er</F> the big difference is that, in my high school, <F>er</F> all the students studied very hard because we had to <F>er</F> pass the entrance examination <F>er</F> <SC>to be enter</SC> <R>to</R> to enter <F>er</F> universities. So we studied very hard. And also we had a kind of <F>er</F> <SC>uni</SC> school uniform. Of course it was not a mandatory. So <R>i</R> if you want, <R>you</R> <OL><SC>you can</SC></OL> <F>er</F> you could <F>ur</F> <F>er</F> wear <SC>u</SC> school uniforms one day and <F>uh</F> on another occasion, you can just <F>er</F> wear anything you want<OL>even the</OL> jeans.So that was a kind of very, very free <F>um</F> school.Yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Uh</F> one of the purpose, <OL>I guess</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Yeah.<F>Hm</F> no, I don't think so.<OL>I see a lot</OL> of students wants to get into colleges.No.<F>Hmm</F>. <nvs>smack</nvs> It's not a very, very good way. But <F>er</F> it's something that you have to go through anyway. Because <SC>you have to</SC> I think they hire <F>er</F> level of education at <F>er</F> university level is necessary for the nation as a whole. So <R>of</R> of course <F>er</F> <F>um</F> many young men should study at universities. But the problem is all the <laughter>students</laughter> wants to get in. That's a problem.<OL>So <SC>I</OL> think even</SC> <F>er</F> I think only the students who are <F>mm</F> eager to study really should go there.So that's a problem. But <SC>the</SC> I think the way of <F>er</F> entrance examination <SC?>ch</SC?> is O K.<F>Hm</F>.Sure.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.O K. O K.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. O K.Hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.<SC?>How</SC?> you must be angry. <F>Um</F><OL>I couldn't</OL> go to the party yesterday. I'm so sorry.<F>Ah</F> yeah. Because I didn't call you.I'm sorry. But I was so busy. I had to work all day in the office. And it was <SC?>su</SC?> quite amazing. I was <laughter>so</laughter> busy and I couldn't <F>er</F> <SC>she</SC> <F>er</F> spear <SC>only one minute</SC> even a single minute, <OL>I couldn't spear</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Oh</F> even the <OL><laughter><SC>bath time</SC> <R>ba</R> bathroom, I couldn't go</laughter></OL>And I was so busy. And so I'm sorry that I couldn't <F>er</F> attend the party.Yeah.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. Yeah. But <F>er</F> <F>um</F> no, <F>uh</F> unexpected thing happened in my office. And <F>er</F> I was told that I had to finish the work <F>er</F> by ten o'clock <F>er</F> yesterday night. And it was a huge amount of work. So <F>er</F> I'm sorry. <F>Uh</F> maybe <SC>I can <F>er</F> make up <F>er</F> like</SC> <F>um</F> I can compensate like <F>um</F> <SC>I can give a ho</SC> I can have <SC>a</SC> another party in my house next week.<OL><F>Well</F></OL> I will check. I will check it and I will organize <R>everyth</R> everything. So that maybe <SC>I can</SC> we can have another party.I will explain. I will call everyone tomorrow or today. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Thank you very much <OL>for understanding</OL>.<OL>No</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>.Yes. <F>Uh</F> <R>i</R> it was not really a party. But <F>er</F> my husband <F>er</F> and I went to a very, very gorgeous restaurant in a very famous hotel with <R>my</R> my parents and with <SC>my husband's <F>er</F> mother</SC> my mother-in-law. And we had a guest. And <F>ur</F> that was a kind of a anniversary <F>hmm</F> get together, because <SC>that wa</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>we</SC> <F>er</F> next June, <F>er</F> there will be a twentieth anniversary of <SC>my wedding</SC> <OL>our wedding</OL>.And the <SC>guest</SC> main guest was a kind of matchmaker. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>I was arranged <F>er</F> to</SC> <SC>I was <?>in</?></SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> excuse me, my husband was introduced to me by her. So <F>er</F> she was very, very important for us. <laughter>So</laughter> that was a nice <F>um</F> get together. And we ate a very, very <F>er</F> expensive, <nvs>laughter</nvs> delicious dinner. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Hm</F>.<F>Hmm</F>.Yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F> <F>hm</F></OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K. One day last week, I went to a department store to buy a happy birthday present for my husband. <F>Er</F> I thought a tie would be nice and I just straight go to the tie section, and I found a very nice <F>er</F> green tie with <F>er</F> brown dots. And <SC>I</SC> <SC>it was</SC> although it was a little expensive, I didn't bother to <SC>bu</SC> pay a lot of money because that's a present. So I asked the sales clerk to wrap <F>er</F> it as a present. And he wrap it nicely with a red ribbon. And I paid in cash. And on the way back home <SC>I</SC> in the department store, I found a final sale of shoes. <F>Er</F> it was written <JP><SC>san</SC></JP> three percent off. And "<F>Oh</F>," I thought, "it's cheap.". And I was so glad. So I bought a pair of shoes <SC>for my</SC> for me. And then next <F>er</F> section, I found <F>er</F> fifty percent off <nvs>laughter</nvs> sales of clothes for ladies. And I was so happy. And I bought a very nice <F>er</F> yellow sweater. So <nvs>laughter</nvs> when I went out to the department store, I end up with buying a lot of things for myself and one nice gift for my husband.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Hm</F>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<CO><F>Well</F> <OL>I</OL></CO>.I think <F>er</F> the quality, too. They want to appeal <F>er</F> they can <F>er</F> offer a good thing <F>er</F> at a very certain low price. So <R>tha</R> <SC>that's one of their <F>er</F> point <R>to</R> to</SC> <R>tha</R> that's a very <SC>ni</SC> good point that they want to show. So <F>er</F> what else? <nvs>laughter</nvs> <CO>Wha</CO>.Because if <R>i</R> it was very cheap from the beginning, you can't compare. <F>Uh</F> because <R>u</R> <SC?>you</SC?> usually the customers compare. They often just visit and don't buy anything and just <SC>look fo</SC> <SC>look a</SC> <SC>look for</SC> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> look around <F>er</F> in the department store. And <SC>they</SC> the customers know the price very much. And then maybe one month later, it is discounted fifty percent, then they can <laughter>buy</laughter>. <laughter>So if it was <SC>s</SC></laughter> cheap from the beginning, they think, "<F>Oh</F> it must be a very, very <SC>bad</SC> bad quality." or something like that. Of course if they check by themselves, they can know. But usually, they compare the <SC>price</SC><OL>prices</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>. No, not really. I don't like <F>er</F> sales. Because there're so many people.It's too crowded for me. So I just rather want to go shopping in a very quiet store. And of <laughter>course, if it is very, very</laughter> expensive, I don't buy <OL>anything</OL>.But if it is a reasonable price, I will buy.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<nvs>laughter</nvs><nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. <SC>Actually I</SC><OL>probably I</OL> <laughter>will</laughter> go to a bookstore and buy some books.No. <nvs>laughter</nvs><nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.No.Yes. I need to sleep, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>I guess</OL>.Yeah.<OL>Yes</OL>. <OL>You're welcome</OL>.Yeah.<OL>You, too</OL>. O K. Thank you.
