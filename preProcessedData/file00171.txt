 my name is .
Yes, please. , can I call you 
?
.
 I'm very fine  today.
So  but, I'm a little bit tired because I took a TOEIC test  one hour ago. 
 maybe     I expect  more than eight hundred fifty this time.
 Hopefully.
 Sorry?
.
  actually I didn't  prepare for this  test.
But,    on my business so  I have chance to travel to abroad for many times   within one month.
So actually visited Thailand and Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Actually it was last week.
 maybe,  I could achieve. 
I hope. 
.  O K. .  It was in Singapore. .  It was  the end of  October.  we organized big  symposium and reception party   in Singapore during the conference. And I organized the reception party by myself.
And   with  more than one   hundred fifty  participants to the reception party. So  we can successfully   our for my  experience in this year.

 yes. Actually,  I went to Singapore this February for  the inspection purpose.
And I   decided the place. . It's a famous hotel in Singapore, name   Hotel.  and  after that I  directly contacted from Tokyo  Singapore     how can I say,  about food or entertainment. And   anyway, many things related to a reception party.
 yes, yes.
  accident?  yes. It was my second trip to abroad.   when I traveled to Malaysia and I moved to Singapore. I forgot   how can I say,    my suit 
at the airport.
When I checked in the hotel in Singapore, I  recognized, ", where is my suit?".
And  ask   to the hotel concierge and I explained the situation. And  they can  contact to the person in  airport in Malaysia and   at last,  the midnight of the day,  I could receive   my suit. 
.
So that's why  I paid  my, how can I say, gratitude,
 to the person. 
I forgot. 
It was about  two to three thousand in Japanese yen.

Yes.
O K.  it's  in the   classroom.  maybe seems   high school? It seems  private high school. And    a female teacher is  now lecturing,  maybe,  mathematics. And      she  draw,  how can I say,   graph,  on the blackboard and explain  it.  however,  some of the  students   seems not interested to her lecture.           how can I say,  one student  who is a man   who is crossing his arm and having a chewing gum and looking outside. And two ladies are chatting with each other. And,  one boy  listening   a walkman,  music tape and drinking some  beverages. And  the other lady is,  maybe,   using her,  mobile phone. Maybe,  they are  typing,  e-mail to her friend.   but only one,     boy      really interested in her lecture. And  they are   taking some notes  about her lecture.
O K.
That's the situation of  this  classroom.
.  O K.   maybe      in the test season, maybe,      they'll  not  pass the test.  Maybe,   they cannot achieve the minimum  requirement score. 
O K. Because   they are not wearing   school  uniform.
Generally speaking, in Japanese,   students are required to wear  a school uniform.
But  I'm not sure the current situation. 
You're welcome.
Yes.
Thank you.
.  which one?
.
O K. Thank you.
O K.
 excuse me.   do you remember me? So  I bought,  this  bag from your  shop  yesterday. And when I  back to my home and opened the package, and   actually,  I'm not  really   like this bag. So,  if possible, I'd like to ask you to   pay back  the money     or I'd like to  change to   another type of bag instead of this.
?
. O K.  in that case  can I talk to your manager here?
Business trip? . O K.     so  as you mentioned,  you don't have  authority to decide 
to change to another one or to  pay back money to me?
.  so please tell me  when your manager  come back to this shop?
In two weeks? O K. So can I  leave  this bag here today and  can I  talk to your manager in two weeks?
O K. So here is the bag I bought  yesterday. And this is my name card.
And  I will  come back in two week
to meet your manager.
 yes. Here you are.
 no problem.
Thank you very much. Yeah.
O K.
. 
Some people say so. 
Me?  maybe  I'll do the same thing.
  as I showed now. 
.  Yes.  in Japan, yes. Yes.
  yes,    I changed to   more expensive one. So I had to pay the   additional money  to change to the other one. Yeah.
? ?
 because it seems to   how can I tell,  more   sophisticated.
And actually, I really wanted to buy the one.
Yes. Sure. 
Yes.
Yes.
 ? O K.  let me clarify.        what I have to do is,  I make a story 
about these six pictures?
.
And this  story  was happened before?
You said  that situation?
   can I have time  to prepare?
O K. So please give me a couple of minutes.
. 
O K.  shall I start now?
O K. .  O K.   it was   Saturday on last week. And   one couple  were walking  together. .    it was raining on the day. And     O K, they having their umbrellas. And  walking  together and chatting. And when    they come to  near the  how can I say,  pole, there was a  box. And when they are going to pass the box,     he heard     some sound from the box. And the man stopped. And    carefully opened the box. Then,  they  found a  maybe, cat  from the box. And   the lady    who was  walking together with the man,   came to the box and   put up  the cat. And  she asked him   she wants to  take the cat,  to her home.  but  the  man, maybe her boyfriend,  seems to   not    welcome to  take the cat   to maybe their home, not her home.  but she was, very  good at  negotiating    with her boyfriend. Finally,   her boyfriend  agreed to  take the cat,  to their home.  O K.
  I imagined. 
If the situation has happened to
me?
.  O K.  it depends on the situation.
.  When    we're not married yet,    I'm sure   I did the same way.  
but  marriage, maybe I denied. 
.  . Yeah, it's a kind of a negotiation 
with   man and lady. 
 yes.  especially  after    our case, for example,    I forgot the name of the  dog but,   Japanese people      how can I say,   tend to   buy  pets,  based on the   trend. And when the  trend has gone   Japanese       how can I say, tend to    keep them. So as the result,   many   pets    lose their homes.
 .
.
.
Yes.  maybe I will go to  fishing
on a boat.
Yes.     I usually go to  fishing on weekend.
.   yes. For fishing itself, by myself.
Yes.
 Yes.
