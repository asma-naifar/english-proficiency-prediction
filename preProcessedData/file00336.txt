But I think mainly, it's love story.<F>Mhn</F>.Six. O K. <F>Er</F>. They are high school students. And this girl likes this guy, but this guy <F>er</F> doesn't know how she feels to him. And one rainy day, <F>er</F> they met by accident. And at that time, <F>er</F> <R>it</R> it start raining. And at that time, this boy heard cats crying.

But yeah, maybe half of them. <F>Mm</F>.<F>Er</F> I think the speed of music is very different. Bossa Nova is very slow. And how to say, the lyric is not so clear, but <F>er</F> the other music is lyric is very clear, and <SC>very quick</SC> the speed is very quick. So <F>er</F> I don't feel very comfortable when I listen to them.<OL>Different, yes</OL>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>You're <OL>welcome</OL>.<F>Oh</F> really? <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>O K.Today, I will go to Sannomiya, and I wanna buy electric dictionary.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F> I have never had it.
