 one day last week, man was driving his car and from forward men who was riding his motorcycle came, and they crashed each other and you are to be blamed, you got my motorcycle broken and at the rear part and so but the man who was driving his car could not agree with it, so they decided to call the police and the police came and they explained what happened and what was the accident like and I don't know what kind of solution but they had, but they then called for the car repairing company, I don't know but, and the person came with a truck and got this motorcycle he's looking at it. But I can't understand what happened. bad one yeah his
I'm sorry.
.
.
 no.
 . I've witnessed some small accidents before, but not that kind of big accident that people might be or but no big accident, but I'm not that good at driving so I have to be careful. 
 I think that you must first call the police and have him examine what happened here. And then, you have to call the insurance company and have to person that who was in the accident. So first of all, you have to call the police.

.
 job hunting, and lot of home work, so I don't have enough time to go out and play, so I think I will be studying so hard and I think it would be a boring . Yeah.
.

Thank you very much.
