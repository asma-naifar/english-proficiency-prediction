 my hobby is to go driving.
 last trip. 
   I usually drive around   near my house, so I don't go that far, but  recently,   fishing. And  went  to   near  City,
 and  took about  thirty minutes.

Yeah.

.
.
 . I think this is         it's a sunny day and  there are some houses and   and in front of one of it, there is a girl  playing with a jump rope.  And there are  three dogs actually and    one is  kept by a woman, and she is talking with another woman. And  there is a car, maybe her car. And  there is a cat on the car, and  the other two dogs are  there are   maybe playing each other, and there is also  a man jogging   and two boys are playing  volleyball.    and the other side of the  road,  there is a man reading a newspaper on the bench.   .
. 
O K.
Yes, it's like that.
 it's in the country side and  there is lots of fields surrounding my house and    the houses are   each house are quite big and  they all have a huge yard and  they usually have pets, like dog or cats or that kind of. And  lot of children live there. And   excuse me.
We have lot of parks and there is a big river called  River  near our house and  the scenery is very good. So it's a beautiful place. .

O K. 
 excuse me  last  week  I bought a shirt at  your shop. And first, I really liked it, I wanted it, but when I went back home and I saw it, and  the color was  not just like what I have thought. And  I don't like this. , so  I want to return this back and  I want the money paid back. Is it O K?

 last week,  I thought it was on Wednesday.

 but  I actually bought this  here, and it's still  last week and       it hasn't been that long since I bought it. So I think it's still O K.
. When will he come back?
O K. .  can you ask him when he is come back?
Sure, I can. .
.
Thank you.
 .
.
 yeah.
 but  at that time,     the lady who was at the counter    could accept my    demanding so  it was smoothly done.  So we  had no problem.
Yeah.
.
If I was  at the shop  .
. ?
   I would try to explain  really hard and try very very hard    and eventually, it was    not accepted, I will give up but I'll try to   make her understand my    feelings.

 O K.
 one day last week,  man was driving his car and  from forward  men who was riding his motorcycle  came, and  they crashed  each other and   the man who was riding his motorcycle said that   you are to be blamed,  you got my motorcycle     broken and    at the rear part and  so  but the man who was driving his car could not  agree with it,  so they decided to  call the police and the police came and they   explained what happened and what was the accident like and   then   I don't know  what kind of  solution  but they had, but  they then  called for the    car repairing company,  I don't know but, and the person came with a  truck and got this motorcycle  to the repairing shop and   he's looking at it.  But  I can't understand what happened.    which was responsible for this accident, so I don't know why he is not here.  . Yeah. 
I'm sorry.
.
.
 no.
 . I've  witnessed some small accidents before, but  not that  kind of big accident   that people might be  or but  no big accident, but I'm not that good at driving so I have to be careful. 
  I think that you must first  call the police and  have him  examine what happened here. And      then, you have to  call the  insurance company and  have to     start to talk with the other  person that who was in the accident. So  first of all, you have to call the police.

.
 as I told, I have to do  job hunting, and  lot of home work, so I don't have enough time to go out and play, so I think  I will be  studying so hard  and  I think it would be a boring  . Yeah.
.
. Yeah. I think . .
Thank you very much.
