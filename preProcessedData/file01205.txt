Good afternoon.
. my name is .
It's my first name. .
Yes.
 I'm great. Thank you.
?
.
 actually, in fact, I like winter summer.
I think so.
Yes.
Winter time, I don't really do anything particularly, 
 I just like the cold climates, I guess. I was born in .
 since I was a kid, I've been doing skiing, not snowboarding, but I used to seeing a lot of snow in the winter time, and I it. So, yeah.
My job. currently I work for the company called .
 just a part of .
 and what I do is I work at the teaching department.
 I do the training for teachers, especially for Japanese teachers, not much for native teachers. and I also do the hiring. I do hire Japanese teachers. so those two are the main parts of my job.
 and also I take care of the managers, and I give them or do training for the managers to understand the products of the . And also I provide not only the training, but like interview sessions with the managers. and sometime I give little bit of mini lessons of English .
Yeah.
 I mean difficulties.
Not really the difficulties, but I sometimes feel that like the gap between like the native teachers' thinking and also 
like thinking in that matter. though our native teachers sort of have the understanding for the Japanese cultures and also what's going on in a Japanese company, they maybe not me and accepting Japanese,
right, traditional way of doing the business. So sometime of course I get in like arguments with the native .
 I try to have meeting frequently and consistently. maybe like once a week or once in every three days. But sometime it's very difficult to have like meeting once a week, even. because half of my week, I usually go out and do my job, in the office.
And so as native teachers. But to talk about the problems, talk about their thought or our thought over the table, it's a very important thing. So that's what I'm trying to do .
Sure.
Thank you.
Describe?
 it's one sunny day. looks like a Sunday morning. just in a residential area. looks peaceful. And jogging on the street. the little girl is doing jumping rope, I guess. and a man is reading a paper on the bench. And two kids are playing. and there are three dogs and one cat on the taxi, I believe. to describe ? It looks like ideal family or ideal life that I would like to have in my future.
I'd like to have something like this when I get older.
.
 yes. I've been to America.
Yes.
 this scene is pretty similar to not where I grew up, but the suburban area of the where I grew up.
 the place like this is not really the place where closer to the city rather than around the suburban area. And also from my perspective, people who can live around the neighborhood like this is usually the upper-middle class people. So it really looks like the one neighborhood that I've seen in America, .
Yeah.
.
Sure.
O K.
.
O K.
O K.
O K.
I think so.
.
 yes, ma'am. I have just bought this sweater about couple of hours ago. because I liked it, and I chose myself, and I bought it. so I took it home, and I looked at again, and I'm sorry, but I just didn't like this color all the sudden. actually I had not exactly the same, but similar sweater which I forgot about. So if I can return this product and if I can have refund,
 that'll be great. .
.
 ?
 it's a hundred percent? ?
.
Right. But of course I haven't worn yet, and I have original receipt.
 if you can consider of getting this back .
 or if I can talk to the manager if you have
 store.
 I tried it on .
. .
Right. But I totally forgot about the sweater that I bought 
 which is very similar color with similar style.
Yeah. So yeah, I'd rather return this product and I'd like to get something else.
Yeah. That'd be wonderful, but if you can consider that.
.
.
 yes is there any chance that I can talk to your manager of this store?
. Do you know when she's coming back, or
is there any way that I can make an appointment, please?
In two hours? I don't know whether I can do this or not, but may I just come back in two hours and maybe
have a second try?
Thank you very much for your help.
Thank you.
 buying things.
 when I first went to America, I had a problem understanding the different sizes.
Like instead of showing in centimeters, they showed in some kind of not in inches, I believe, like for the jeans, they say like thirty something instead of saying eighty something in your waist.
So yeah, I thought it was a problem. But after a while, I get used to it all right. But to be honest, I've never returned anything
. this is actually the first time. .
.
 feeling. .
 I'm not a type of person uses a lot of time to do shopping. I go into the store, and look at it, and then if I like it instantly, I'll buy it.
 so the feeling is very important.
Yeah.
 retur.
That is too much hassle for me.
I wear it. 
.
.
Sure.
.
O K.
 one day last week, we planned to go camping. and we've been thinking about going camping for a long time, but never happened, but one day last week, it happened. and my friend and I pack up the stuff, and put everything in the car. And we went camping near our neighborhood where river runs through. when we got there, first we set the tent. And also we started cooking I mean, lunch. but suddenly and unfortunately, it start raining. so we packed up everything to the car again, and we're trying to go home. we're on our way to go home. because wind was blowing so hard, we lost everything. we found a hotel near the river where we're supposed to do the camping. And we decided to just stay over night there. and we did. . I'm just terrible.
.
What do I think of them?
What do I think of them. I envy them. 
Because I don't have time doing that even though I really like doing it. I love fishing in particular. But I don't have time to go fishing. So yeah, I pretty much envy .
Yeah.
O K.
 I probably have to work till yeah, . Yeah.
 since I have to work tomorrow,
 I'll just go home and relax and be ready for tomorrow.
Yeah.
 you?
 tomorrow that's too bad.
Thank you .
Thank you .
