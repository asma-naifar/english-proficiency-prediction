Good afternoon.<OL>O K</OL>. <F>Ur</F> my name <R>i</R> is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.It's my first name. <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes.<F>Urm</F> I'm great. Thank you.<OL>And you</OL>?<OL><F>Mm-hm</F></OL>.<F>Well</F> actually, in fact, I like winter <OL>better than</OL> summer.I think so.Yes.Winter time, <SC>I don't</SC> <?>usually</?> I don't really do anything particularly, <OL>but</OL><R>I just like</R> I just like the cold climates, I guess. I was born in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Urm</F> <F>er</F> <R>since</R> since I was a kid, <F>ur</F> I've been doing skiing, <SC>and</SC> not snowboarding, but <F>ur</F> I used to seeing a lot of <F>ur</F> snow in the winter time, and I <OL>always liked</OL> it. So, yeah.My job. <F>Urm</F> currently I work for the company called <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>.<F>Ur</F> just a part of <F>ur</F> <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H>.<F>Urm</F> and what I do is <R>I</R> <F>well</F> I work at the teaching department.<R>I</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> I do the training for teachers, <F>ur</F> especially for Japanese teachers, not much for native teachers. <F>Ur</F> and I also do the hiring. <F>Ur</F> I do hire Japanese teachers. <F>Ur</F> so those two are the main parts of my job.<F>Urm</F> and also I take care of the managers, and I give them or do training for the managers <F>ur</F> to understand <R>the</R> the <F>urm</F> products of the <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H>. And also <F>ur</F> I provide not only the training, but <F>ur</F> like interview sessions with the managers. <F>Urm</F> and sometime I give little bit of <F>uh</F> mini lessons of English <OL>as well</OL>.Yeah.<F>Well</F> <SC>yeah, in that regard probably</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>um</F> I mean <F>mm</F> difficulties.Not really the difficulties, but I sometimes feel that like the gap between <F>ur</F> like the native teachers' thinking and also <R>Japanese</R> <F>well</F> <SC>Japanese in general</SC>like thinking in that matter. <F>Urm</F> though our native teachers sort of have the understanding for the Japanese cultures and also what's going on in a Japanese company, <SC>but still, <F>urm</F> <R>they</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> they <SC>not</SC> <R>maybe not</R> maybe not me</SC>, but they have difficulties with working in a Japanese company <R>and</R> and accepting Japanese,right, traditional way of doing the business. So sometime of course I get in like arguments with the native <OL>trainers that I work with</OL>.<R>I</R> <R>I try to have</R> <SC>I try to have as much</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> I try to have meeting <F>ur</F> frequently <F>ur</F> and consistently. <F>Ur</F> maybe like once a week or once in every three days. But sometime it's very difficult to have like meeting <F>ur</F> <SC>in</SC> once a week, even. <F>Ur</F> because <SC>I</SC> half of my week, I usually <R>go</R> go out and do my job, <OL>not <R>in</R> in</OL> the office.And so as native teachers. But to <R>ta</R> <SC>talk about it</SC> talk about the problems, talk about <F>ur</F> their thought or our thought <F>ur</F> <SC?>on this</SC?> over the table, it's a very important thing. So that's what I'm trying to do <OL>right now</OL>.Sure.Thank you.Describe?<F>Ur</F> it's one sunny day. <F>Urm</F> <R>looks like</R> looks like a Sunday morning. <F>Urm</F> just in a residential area. <F>Urm</F> looks peaceful. <nvs>laughter</nvs> And <F>urr</F> <.></.> man is <SC>running on the street</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> jogging <F>ur</F> on the street. <F>Ur</F> the little girl is <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> doing jumping rope, I guess. <F>Urm</F> and a man is reading a paper <F>ur</F> on the bench. And two kids are playing. <F>Ur</F> and there are three dogs and one cat on the taxi, I believe. <F>Urm</F> <SC>it's</SC> to describe <F>huh</F>? It looks like <R>a</R> <R>ideal</R> ideal family or ideal life that I would like to have in my future.I'd like to have something like this <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>when I</R></OL> when I get older.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Ur</F> yes. <SC>I</SC> <R>I've been to</R> I've been to America.Yes.<F>Urm</F> <SC>it</SC> <SC>this looks like</SC> <F>urm</F> <SC>it</SC> <R>this sce</R> this scene is pretty similar to <F>urm</F> not where I grew up, but <F>urm</F> the suburban area of the <H pn="others2">XXX06</H> <SC>I</SC> where I grew up.<F>Urm</F> <SC>it's not</SC> the place like this is <F>mm</F> not really <SC>cc</SC> the place where closer to the city <F>urm</F> rather than around the suburban area. And also from my perspective, <F>ur</F> people who can live around the neighborhood like this is usually the <F>ur</F> upper-middle class people. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <F>urm</F> <SC>that i</SC> it really looks like the one neighborhood that I've seen in America, <OL>suburban areas</OL>.Yeah.<OL>Sure</OL>.Sure.O K.<OL>Sure</OL>.O K.O K.O K.I think so.<OL>I'll try</OL>.<F>Ur</F> yes, ma'am. <F>Ur</F> I have just bought this sweater about <F>urm</F> couple of hours ago. <F>Ur</F> because I liked it, and <R>I</R> I chose myself, and I bought it. <F>Ur</F> <SC>but</SC> so I took it home, and <R>I</R> I looked at <?>it</?> again, and <SC>I</SC> I'm sorry, but I just didn't like this color all the sudden. <SC>I</SC> actually I had <SC>ss</SC> not exactly the same, but similar sweater <F>ur</F> which I forgot about.
