to get a driver's license. And you go to this authorized driving school. And you go to your test for driving. And also study about the rules.
And after graduating those driving school, this you have to go through a testing that I think Ministry something
 Japanese government does. And, yes, I think you have scale about for eighty percent to go pass through it.
You have to go through that yeah, tests, if you want to get a driving license.
