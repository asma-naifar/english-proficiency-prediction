I think it's very full of peace the scene is. and that desktop P C is all . . if I have it I dislike it because for me the desk is very important for the job and for writing diary . So the desk is so narrow the P C is occupied the half of the desk. So I throw up it.

live one-room,

I was looking for the 
cheap youth hotel. And I always look for the 
native friends, because many times the natives invited me for their house. So many local family food and many local music and many local folklore I could enjoy. . So I have never have that experience.

So my girlfriend says I took it to our home. But I hate cat too, very much, because I had a very sick allergy and the smell and the hair of cats makes me very bad as usual. So at the first I refused it. but her eyes prayed for cat. love I love her face very much. So I have to accept it. . her smile looked very happy.
