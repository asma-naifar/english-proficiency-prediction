  after they go to bed,   I enjoy my time.
Or  I live with my husband's 
mother in law,
so she usually  looks after my baby and my son and daughters.
  so I have a little time to do myself.

Movie?  recently,   didn't see the movie. But   on summer vacation,  no,  spring vacation,
I went to see the movie with my son.   that movie was "Monster's Inc".  that was produced  Walt Disney,
Company. And that was  animation movie but that was amazing. I'm very expressed.   the story was very good for adult and children.     at the end of  I almost .
But   I didn't cry. But I wanted to .
O K.   one day,  a woman went to the  to buy  her husband's birthday present. And she found out a good present. That was a tie. And she bought it. And then, she found a bargain sale and she also bought a sweater for herself and she went out from the  with having a big baggage.
 yes. .
 . Before I   choose the present,    I listen   to him and her. .    they always wanted to   toy, so  it's easy to choice. .
.  now,   they likes T V programs and they likes character of them.  and  at the store, there are many  figure of character and  robot. And so   they likes  some robot and  figures of character. .
For me? 
.  .    I don't want to get something but  I'd like to go trip 
 or go to dinner.
 I want  some  for trip or eating.
 . 
Yes.   . At first,
  my children  got  something he  wanted easy, but  I couldn't get   the same thing  even I wanted it.
 because     there are many people  who give my children   to the present.   and there are  many toys at the store. And his friends also  have a lot of things.
     and my son and daughter likes McDonalds.
. But  when  I was a children,  there were no 
near my house.
. So I think 
that is lucky,
for him.
Today?   I have another test, S S T, from  three, .
 but I had never had  lunch,
so I will have a lunch by relaxing after .
