Good afternoon.
Yes.  my name is .
Yes. Certainly. 
 very fine, thank you.  and you?
Yeah. The weather is very beautiful today, isn't it?
It's just like  spring.
.
Yes.  but I prefer autumn.
Yes. Because I was born in autumn and  in autumn, I feel like a little bit , melancholic.  but I like that kind of feeling.
.
In autumn?   in autumn, I'm very much    settle down. And   mainly,  I sit up in front of  P C and making  some  sentences     expressing my feeling  and that kind of thing. And also, I read  many books. .   and I listen to music and I watch  many videos on T V.   that kind of things.
Yes.
 not poem.      but I don't know exactly it's called,       I  think I may call  a kind of notes  in which I express myself  the feelings of those days,   that kind of things.
Just to memory.
Yes.
 no, no, .  No. 
        I'm a housewife. And  a mother of   a boy who is a junior high school student,  second grade. And     three days a week, I work  in a elementary school, especially in the class   in which there are  many  mental disordered children. .  so   how hard the work is  just like  volunteer work.  but anyway, I  get paid. . And  also,     I'm doing a voluntary work in a   yes,  but what should I call,      community hall in a city. And there, I  organize   group  in which there are  ten or twelve  mainly housewives. And   we plan   many things    for citizens and  foreigners who lives in  our area. And to help them  to  communicate  each other.  and also, we contact with  the students of   which is located in our area. And   yes, last September,  we   planned a  pre  Halloween party for the foreigners or    students from other countries and also,  Japanese students and  Japanese  citizens  in our area. And  we had a very big party. And     Yomiuri   Newspaper  , what are they,  came to  take a picture and take  some  notes  of the party.

?   my name was on the newspaper. 
. 
 yes.  this is a  ski   resort. And there are many people skiing at the moment. And   there are some children  playing with snow,  making snowballs and throwing  each other. Yeah. . And     jo they are having fun  skiing.   yeah, and  one of  them  is just  the  fallen, ,   on the snow.  . . They look very much     having fun. Yes.
  I could say yes. But just a little.  I can do it very little.
Yes. Because  recently, I never had the chance to go to ski.   the last time I skied was almost  when I was a student. ,
  I don't know  I could say yes .
 yes. I like playing tennis. And also swimming.  Yes. And    I started    jogging  since last September. .  Yes. So,  I can say I like to run. .  .

Yeah.  .    I would say  playing tennis is       yeah,  for me. But at the moment,  it's difficult for me to  have  time for playing tennis and going to  the  tennis court. And also,  sometimes it's difficult to   find the person to play with. So, just  jogging is very simple,  just running  myself. So,    that's, yeah.
Yes.
 Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
 no, no, no.  I don't think I did it.
.
. O K.
.
Yes.
.
 yes.   yesterday, I bought this sweater. But  it was a little bit too big for me. So, if possible, I'd like to   return it. . Yes.  I'd like to change  this one to another a little bit smaller one.
 is that possible?
I see.   but I have a receipt here. And I just bought it . And I never  worn it. So,   I think   you should  take it back and  I can  change it to  another smaller one. .
Yeah.
 could you do it for ?
I see.  So, then,  can I have   another type of sweater? .  And  with        same price?  is that possible?
 yes. .
Yes.
I see. Two thousand more.
Yeah. That's O K. .
Yes.
.
Yeah. .
 ? .  yes.  but I don't like just   browsing     shops. And    I prefer to go shopping when I really need something.  .    because  I just don't want to lose my time  just browsing shops.   I am not such kind of  person who just browsing or killing time to go around or to watch   something or .
.
.
 In the past days, I tried sometimes. But  it didn't work well. .
   often   the things  I ordered  were   little different from I imagined. So,  the color was different  and textile   was different. And so,  I don't like  to buy through catalog shopping.
So, I stopped it. 
Yes.
.
 you mean through catalog shopping?
 then, I    send them back    to the  shop.
Yeah.
.  no, no.  just  return them.
Yeah.
.
Yes.
.
.
. Yeah. . One day last week,    yeah.    I name this person  Hisashi. .
  Hisashi went to  the station  to go to  his office. And    on the platform of the station,    someone just   hit Hisashi by his elbow. And           they   happened  to  fall his  bag    down to the railroad. And he got angry with the man who hit him.  but  the man just   said "That wasn't  my fault".    and   at that time,  while they were  arguing,  the train was suddenly  came into the station and   Hisashi's bag,  and    the  train     past over  Hisashi's bag.     but  fortunately, the bag was safe and wasn't damaged. So, Hisashi was  got very much relieved.    and then,        the person,   I forgot  the  specific word for  the person. But  the man who works in the station    stepped down on the railroad and picked up Hisashi's bag and    give it to  Hisashi. Yes. And finally,  Hisashi got his bag back and he is very happy now.
Yes.
 .  Yeah.  he learned    he shouldn't   step on     very much edge of the platform.   because it is very dangerous. And  yeah.   Yeah. Especially, when  the platform is  crowded  by  many people. . Yes. Yeah.
.
Yes.

 I started   exchanging e-mails since last month. And  he is an Italian. And  he happen to  come to Japan.

 but   when he came to Japan or he arrived in Japan,   I was just about to leave for Canada,
   eight days. And when I came back to Japan,    he was just about to leave for Kyoto.  then he  sent me a   e-mails  saying he'll be back  on Thursday. That mean today.
