Nice to meet you.
I'm very fine today.
Yes,  it is.
Yes, I like summer because    there is many kinds of play. For example,  swimming and  climb mountains  and so on.
. Unfortunately    there are many things to do  in summer.  for example   it is  concerned about my research. I am master course student, so there are many things to do. So  I can't play enough in the summer.
No. . This is the first year of master course for me.
 yes. So it is rather  free in this year.
. I specialize in physics. . And I have to  do presentation   early August. . So what I have to do is  the  preparation for the presentation.
Yes.
    I take care about the  things. .  First  imagine the audience not so good at physics. Then I feel   I have to  express or  do explanation more  carefully and kindly. . So first I have to  consider that the audience are not so special. And second  prepare and prepare and prepare and study.
  I listen to music,  ordinally. . And  especially the classical music. The classical music sounds is very calm for me. So I can relax very much.
Yes. . For example,  Franz List and Frederic Chopin and so on.  their music is  so called   Romantic. And their sounds calms me very much.
Yes.
No.
O K. .  It is very fine day. And  there are many person here  and  some animals.   a cat is lying on a car. And  two womans are talking to each other. And  many people  do  what they want to do . And they seem to be enjoying   this fine day very much. That's all.
My hometown is  City in  Prefecture.
Yes, sure.  . My hometown has   more houses. Or in other words, very dense.  so they feel very relaxed, because there aren't so many houses in this  street. It is, I think, very good.
 .  My hometown has a very important symbol. It is safflower  in Japanese .  and many people in  city likes  the , for the city flower.     I think  safflower is  very pretty.
 Ordinally    the safflower oil was made from safflower.  so many people use  as the oil.
O K. Ready.

 I have one  suitable for the   beach.
So let me know about that.
Thank you.  So     the color is red and  the half sleeve .  so are there  anything  such like half sleeve and red color?
I think this shirt is very good. But   I don't like the stripes.
  I want to have    so to speak, pure red.
 I like that. So  please give me.   . How much is this shirt?
Fine. So I'll take it.
Thank you very much.
 Yes.  I like to go shopping.
    I think  I'm not so good at  care of casual. But  I take care about this point. That is   remember what's I have already  had. For example, what the color of my bag and what's the color of my  trousers. Then I can do  good shopping, .
 Yes.

O K. One day last week,       I went to have dinner with  my boss. .   since my boss   had known good restaurant, so  we decided to go  the restaurant. . After we  enter the restaurant,  my boss   decided  what seats  shall we  take. And  after sitting    we decided   what shall we eat. . And  my boss let me  decide  whatever I wanted to eat . And  we  had many  things  good delicious dishes and drink  beer. I drunk beer. And my boss  drunk wine . . After finished  eating and  drinking   all the money was   paid  by my boss. I was very contented. And  after the bill  I said good-bye to my boss. And  thanked to my boss. And   the good-by and I went to home. That's all.
All right.     I don't know many good restaurants because  I'm not so  rich. But      I know  one curry shop. .  in that shop, we can eat  the very  real  Thailand curry. . And the   taste is very different from the Japanese curry.
. First it is very very hot. And   it smells the coconuts milk  smell.   and there are many peppers   and so on, I don't know.  But the taste is very good and  I like that.
My friend    took me there . And I know that.
 No. I can't cook.
At all.
   I go to school from my house. So  my mother   cooks.

After this,  yes. I have to go to the laboratory. . So I go there.
Yes.
 Thank you .
Thank you very much.
