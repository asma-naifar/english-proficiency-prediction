Right so <R>I</R> <SC>I don't want</SC> <SC>I don't play</SC> I mean, I don't want to ski.I mean, I used to play baseball for eighteen years.But the reason that I tore my muscle when I was playing baseball.In a game.Right.<F>Ahh</F> <R>it's</R> it's like <F>ah</F> team sports. <SC>I mean, play with</SC> I mean I can't play alone, I can't play individually.Like, we need nine players <R>at</R> at least to play baseball. And let's say, it's <?></?> about practice. We really enjoy playing <F>ah</F> baseball in practice. And also in a game, we all excited <R>to</R> to win the game. That makes me attractive. Right.<F>Well</F> <R>I do</R> I do, yeah.That's a good question. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I mean, the power, right. I used to play baseball in New York, <R>so I</R> so I mean, I had some experiences in there, so. I mean, even we practice a lotthey got big power and can't defeat them. <R>Even</R> even we practice a lot. So, that's a difference, right?Right. Power, I mean.Like a Ichiro? <.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>.<OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>.Better than <SC>Ja</SC> I mean American. <F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> it's <laughter>hard question to</laughter> answer that. <F>Umm</F> let me think about it. <F>Ahh</F> <R>I think</R> I think <F>well</F> like Ichiro, I mean look at Ichiro. He's the one of the best players in Japan and he's got a good eye and good leg. He's faster than anybody. So I think most Japanese <R>people</R> people, I mean Japanese baseball player, they don't have any I mean, specific power, like big power. But they still have chance to get <SC>the</SC> some title or something by running or like hitting the ball. <F>Ahh</F>.Also <SC>defencing</SC> defendant play. <R>I mean</R> I mean, even like we don't have enough power, I mean like Ichiro or like Shinjyo, they got a good shoulder and they got a good shoulder and they are good at throw ball to the home, so.It's better than American people.
