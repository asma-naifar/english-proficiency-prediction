Yeah.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Err</F> maybe studying a lot.<F>Err</F>. Actually, I had a report to give today.So <R>I</R> I was doing that.<OL>yesterday night</OL>.Yes.<CO><F>Er</F> do you mean why</CO>?<F>Well</F> in this case, the one I gave in,today was an easy one. It was like a page of summary or <OL>something</OL>.So I did it. I originate in English <.></.> by hand and then I typed it. And hand it in.<F>Well</F> I like playing football <F>er</F> soccer.And I go to those <F>uum</F> training center <SC>in</SC> next to <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H>. Do you know the new building?<F>Er</F> there's a training center.<OL>And I go</OL> there Monday, Wednesday and Friday,in the morning and <SC>I</SC> the rest of the day, <F>oh</F> I play football with my soccer club members.<OL>And</OL> I go out on Saturday and Sunday <OL>for shopping</OL>.<F>Hm</F> actually, I've been playing it from about when I was a little kid. Around five or six.And I've been doing that <R>for</R> for about twelve years.Until the end of <nvs>snap</nvs> <F>err</F> high school.So <SC>I</SC> you know, <??></??> it's part of my life.<OL><F>Well</F> mainly</OL> it's kicking sports, they need all types of, you know, muscles for <R>every</R> every <??></??>.And of course, <SC>if you want</SC> you need to balance the whole body.So you have to train the <?>top</?> part <.></.> <SC>w</SC> as <F>well</F>.Maybe it is. Because for example, you know Nakata?<CO>The famous</CO>.<F>Eh</F> he is very clever. <F>Er</F> in Italy, he studies a lot after practices.So maybe that's true.I live in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>. Do you know <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>?Yeah. <F>Er</F> west part.I come from <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>,up to Nakano.And from there, <SC>Tozai Line</SC> I change to Tozai Line to <H pn="school name2">XXX06</H>.It's a quite mess. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I mean it's really crowded because the Chuo Line,<OL><??></??> it always stops</OL>.You know, someone done <OL>something again</OL>.Yeah.<F>Um</F>. Actually, I don't have any other way to come to school.<OL>So</OL> I just have to wait. You know?Yes.<F>Hmm</F>.Haven't done that.Yes.Describe this picture?O K. It seems to be <SC>a school</SC> a classroom in <F>well</F> America or somewhere.And the teacher is teaching the students mathematics, I suppose. And it seems to me that <F>er</F> there's only one guy in front of this teacher is listening. And the other guys are talking, chewing gums, drinking and doing their own business. You know? And it seems to be a school without uniforms.Because they are wearing, yeah, their own clothes.And <F>well</F> <.></.> it's a bit sad situation for the teacher, I suppose.<OL>Because it seems</OL> to <?>me</?> that there's only one guy who is <R>I mean</R>, listening.<?>And</?> she looks as if she is doing it hardly.In my high school?My high school? <F>Well</F> <SC>it</SC> actually, it depended on the teacher.Strict teacher, I listen carefully. But most of the <.></.> class I did listen carefully, <R>I suppose</R> I suppose.Yes. Sometimes I was tired because of football.I was doing my club everyday except for Thursday.So maybe I might have been gone to another world. <CO><R>But</R>but I suppose I</CO>.Yes. <OL>Young teacher</OL>.<F>Erm</F> <CO>I</CO>.<SC>I</SC> it must be a very hard thing to do. But <.></.> I think she must use not full time teaching the thing she have to. But she must use the part of time to <SC>communicate same common</SC> you know, <.></.> about <R>talk</R> talk about the same common thing.And <R>co</R> communicate them. Know each other better, I suppose.<F>Uum</F>. Much I don't care of about. <F>Er</F> I used to go to high school <R>wh</R> which you can wear uniform and both your own clothes.So you could choose.But I don't mind. I don't think <?>it's a</?> big problem about uniform.Role-play?Yes.O K.Yeah.<F>Um</F>.<F>Erm</F> I'm afraid I missed my train.<OL>And</OL> I would like to change <SC>my</SC> the ticket I reserved to the next one.<F>Err</F>. But the reason why I came late here was <R>the</R> <.></.> <SC>the one</SC> the train that I get on before got late. So <SC>it's</SC> I think it's part of the <.></.> <SC>train's</SC> <F>er</F> <R>company's</R> <F>err</F> company's problem, I suppose.I don't know. But it stopped and it didn't move as usual. <F>Er</F> so I came here late for my <?>next</?> train.<F>Oh</F> I <OL>see</OL>.<F>Oh</F> I was confused. So I forgot to get that.<F>Er</F> the one I missed. <SC>So</SC> one I missed to way to <.></.> Tokyo.<F>Oh</F> <F>erm</F>.Pardon?Yes. <SC>I have</SC> <F>mm</F> yes, I <?>would do it</?>.O K.Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.<F>Oh</F> yes. It is my first experience.<OL><?>I never done that</?></OL>.Yes, I do.Yes, I have.Recently, I got the license of the car.So I go out around Tokyo or Shizuoka, Kamakura.<F>Well</F> the car traffic is a little of the problem. But <?>you know, that</?> you can listen to your own music.And chat with your friend next to you. And you know, its seats and the things <?>are</?> very comfortable in my car. So it's really good.Make up <OL>a story</OL>.Short one?Is it possible to make up his name or something?O K. O K. One day last week, around eleven-forty, I went to the station as usual <SC>to</SC> <F>er</F> it's eight o'clock?And,<OL>I went to the</OL> station as usual. <R>As</R> as it was a crowded station, <SC>I was</SC> I lost my concentration and <SC>I was walking ar</SC> <F>um</F> I was walking on the platform. And suddenly, I got hit by a man who was talking with big reactions. And he hit my arm. So I accidentally dropped my bag to the rail where the train passes. So what do I have to do? Because <SC>this</SC> <SC>in</SC> <F>er</F> in this time, trains go very often. So if you <SC>got</SC> get off the platform, it'll be very dangerous. And recently, there was news that there was an accident <?>about</?> that. So we talked and talked. But the train came. And I got in a panic. Because there was a very important <.></.> things inside. After the train passed, I was relieved that bag wasn't damaged because it was, fortunately, between rail and rail. <CO>And then, I called the <nvs>snap</nvs> station</CO> <?>though</?> I don't know <?>where</?> he is, the person has something to do with station. And he got off the platform and got the bag for me.Yes.<F>Err</F> first of all, I'll apologize,for it. Maybe if I were him, I might have gone down to get it, looking at whether the train's coming or not. Because, yeah, in this case, it was O K. But if the bag got damaged,you know, <SC?>it gets</SC?> it's very big problem,about, you know, money and stuff.So I might have gone down to get it.Yes.I do.<OL>But <F>er</F></OL> that case was <F>uh</F> completely different from this case. And <.></.> I'm very sorry for the man who <?>got</?> down to get it. And <R>I</R> <SC>I don't know about</SC> it's very sorry, sad story.<F>Hm</F>. I have my fifth class. Yes. French.I have French class. So I go there.And I have my part-time job afterwards.<F>Ur</F> <F>uh</F> type of restaurant or something.No. <R>I</R> I'm belong to service.Yes, I do.Yes.<OL>Thank you</OL> very much.
