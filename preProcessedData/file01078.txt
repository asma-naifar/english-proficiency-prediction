<F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL><?>A very</?></OL> rare name. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.Yes.<F>Ah</F>. I am doing quite well, but <F>ahm</F> because recently, I am quite busy with <F>ah</F> <?>many</?> work and also I am going to get married <SC>in</SC> from two weeks. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<OL><CO>I am quite</CO></OL>. In two weeks, so I am a bit sleepy. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. Actually, when I go home, <R>my</R> my husband is <R>alrea</R> already asleep so <F>ah</F> we don't have that much conversation after all right now. So <F>ahm</F> I can't say that <F>ah</F> <R>my</R> my marriage life is <F>ahm</F> wonderful <OL><laughter>at the moment but</laughter></OL>,<F>ah</F> <.></.> I have to try <OL>to <??></??> communication</OL>.<F>Ah</F> because of my work.<laughter><F>Ahm</F> yes</laughter>. Though it's a bit tough physically. And <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> I'm working in the <SC?>head</SC?> hair care marketing division. And I like to deal with those hear care products, so <F>erm</F> regarding that point, I enjoy my work. But physically,my body is <laughter><F>ah</F></laughter> saying that is too tough. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Hm</F>.<OL>Yes</OL>.O K. So <F>ahm</F> my parents are from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Ah</F> <R>so</R> <F>ah</F> so they have <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> kind of traditional Japanese idea that <F>ah</F> woman should be quiet and polite. And therefore, my name has <F>erm</F> a character of quiet and polite together.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> And so my surname <F>ah</F> I don't know <R>about</R> about my origin,but <F>ah</F> at least my parents are from <F>ah</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> and there are some <?>met</?> relatives,in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> with my <F>ah</F> surname, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.So <F>ah</F> I don't know. Maybe <F>ah</F> origin is from Korea or China. <OL>I don't know</OL>.<??></??>Yes, <R>because my</R> <F>ah</F> because my <R>na</R> name is quite rare,people would remember <F>ah</F> <R>at least</R> <R>if</R> if they couldn't remember all, at least they remember like <F>ahm</F> somebody whose name is quite rare,so I like my name.<.></.> Quiet and polite?<F>Ah</F> I try to be polite,but for quietness, <F>ahm</F> if I keep quiet in this company,I can't do my job. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ah</F> I don't think I am quiet, honestly.All right. <F>Ahm</F>. This seems to be in <F>ah</F> the situation in schools, probably high school.<F>Ah</F>. But it seems quite <R>un</R> unorganized because the teacher is doing <F>ah</F> her lesson <.></.> on her own and actually <SC>nobody is</SC> <F>well</F> only one person up front,this boy is listening to her.And <F>uh</F> other than that, <F>ahm</F> everybody is doing their own job, <F>um</F> these girls are talking, and this boy is listening to music with <F>ahm</F> drink in hand.So <F>ahm</F> it doesn't look quite a good lesson,and I suppose that <F>ahm</F> the lesson is not that much interesting<R>for</R> for these students.Yes. And I think that's mathematics. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F>. <F>Ah</F>. <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F> <R>sha</R> shall I continue <OL><??></??></OL>?<OL><laughter><F>Ah</F> O K</laughter></OL>.<F>Ah</F> <F>well</F>. <F>Um</F>. <..></..> In terms of the clothes <SC>they wear</SC> the students wear, <F>ahm</F> we had uniform,so it looks like more organized because everybody's wearing the same thing <laughter>so</laughter> <R>more</R> more, <F>ahm</F> how can I say, yes, organized than this picture.But <F>ahm</F> <laughter>about the lesson</laughter>, there were some people <F>ah</F> talking during the lesson. So <SC>it</SC> that's the same thing. But at least we didn't have anyone <F>er</F> who were chewing gum <laughter>in a lesson</laughter>, <SC>so</SC> <F>ahm</F> but I think at anytime <F>ahm</F> students will enjoy <SC>their life</SC> <F>ahm</F> their young life, so <F>ahm</F> <R>in that</R> in that sense, the <SC>atmosphere</SC> total atmosphere, it's similar to <R>my</R> my <F>ahm</F> experience in high school.Wearing uniform. <F>Well</F>. <.></.> <F>Ah</F>. I know that <SC>somebody says that they</SC> somebody say that <F>ahm</F> they don't like <F>ahm</F> uniform, but personally, I like uniform because I don't have to think for <??></??> in the morning what to wear so it's quite practical.So and I keep my uniform now.Thank you.Yes.<F>Um</F>.<F>Um</F>.<OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>. <F>Um</F>. <R>So</R> so I've already <.></.> taken this trip, right? <F>Ah</F> O K. <.></.> O K. <F>ahm</F> so it's on the phone, right? O K. <F>Ah</F> hello?<F>Erm</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<F>Ahm</F>. I joined your <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> pack trip <F>ahm</F> last week to Germany, and I know that <F>ahm</F> we are going to go around <SC>with the bus, but in fact</SC> <F>ah</F> with a comfortable bus but in fact the bus was really small and <F>ahm</F> <?>everything</?> was packed together in a very, very small <F>ahm</F> bus, and I wouldn't say that it was a comfortable trip. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Ah</F>. <F>Aa</F>. And in addition to that, I know that <F>erm</F> the last night of the trip, we will have a German traditional meal, but actually it was just a hamburger with <F>ah</F> some French fries.And I don't think that was a <.></.> traditional German meal, so <F>ahm</F> I suppose <F>ah</F> there is a exaggeration in your brochure of the <F>ahm</F> this pack tour.<F>Ahm</F>. Could you explain how this happened?Less people than <??></??> <OL>you mean</OL>?So <F>ahm</F> I know that the bus was going to be large enough <R>to</R> <F>ahm</F> to make us all comfortable. So in fact, we had to use the spare seats,so <SC>somebody</SC> someone <F>ah</F> fall down in the bus because <??></??> <R>without the</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <??></??> difficult,<F>well</F> without the seat's belt, so I don't think it was a comfortable trip <OL>at all</OL>.<F>Ah</F> thank you.Yeah, but <F>ahm</F>according to the brochure of <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> <SC>the trip</SC> the pack trip, <F>ahm</F> it sounded like <F>ahm</F> more special <?>case</?><F>er</F> with <F>ahm</F> traditional German beer.But <F>ahm</F> we actually <F>ahm</F> had <F>ahm</F> hamburger which we could have in MacDonald's in Japan. So <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>we were completely <F>ahm</F> unhappy <R>with</R> with <R?>that</R?> that meal.Yeah, but <SC>this</SC> <F>er</F> it didn't say anything <F>ahm</F> about the relation between the cost <R>and the</R> and <F>ah</F> the meals and <R>the</R> the last night, so <F>ah</F> we were not convinced with <SC>that</SC> <F>ahm</F> <F>erm</F> the reason of the cost.<F>Ahm</F>. So at least, we would like to <F>ahm</F> explain <R>with</R> <F>ah</F> with <F>ah</F> documents <F>ahm</F> <SC>why</SC> <R>ho</R> how <F>ahm</F> <SC>could ha</SC> could this has happenedand <F>ahm</F> <F>ah</F> maybe you could also offer us some <F>ahm</F> <.></.> couponfor the next trip. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.<laughter>Thank you very much</laughter>. <OL><laughter>Quite difficult</laughter></OL>.No, <F>ahm</F> I am going to have a wedding in two weeks. <F>Oh</F> we have been together already. But my wedding is in two weeks.So after that, I am going to the honeymoon.<F>Um</F>. I hope that wouldn't <laughter>be so terrible <OL>as I <??></??> here</OL></laughter>.<F>Um</F>. O K. <F>Ahm</F>. Last week <F>ahm</F> <.></.> on weekend, <F>ahm</F> <.></.> my friend and I decided to go to campand <F>ahm</F> we prepared all the things going camping and to have meals outside, <F>ahm</F> <SC>we were</SC> <F>er</F> because we used to have campings very often <F>ahm</F> when we were students. <F>Ah</F> <F>ah</F>. Recently, we were quite busy with our work, so <F>ahm</F> we were quite looking forward to having a nice <?>and</?> a blue sky and <F>ah</F> delicious meal outside. So <R>we went <F>er</F> with</R> <F>er</F> we went with a car to Nagano Prefecture. And <F>ahm</F> at first, everything was going <R>all</R> all right. <F>Erm</F> the blue sky, the fresh air, <F>ah</F> we were quite happy with that. But <F>ahm</F> right after we finished <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> building the tent, the weather <F>ah</F> changed. <F>Ah</F> <SC>it started to</SC> <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> the shower started and so <F>ahm</F> I was quite worried that <SC>we wouldn't be able to have a</SC> we wouldn't <R>be</R> be able to continue camping. And I told my friend <F>ahm</F> to find some hotels. Then, my friend <F>ah</F> who knew well about Nagano Prefecture <F>er</F> told me that <F>ahm</F> she knew a nice hotel, so we decided to go to that hotel. But when we tried to <F>ahm</F> pack up all the pans and the <F>ah</F> things for the <F>ah</F> outdoor <F>er</F> cooking, <F>ahm</F> the wind <R>be</R> became very strong and we have <F>erm</F> <F>ah</F> some troubles <SC>packing in</SC> packing everything into the car. And finally <F>ahm</F> after two hours <F>ah</F> fighting with the wind, <F>ah</F> we arrived at the hotel. <F>Ah</F> the hotel was quite nice and we could have a relaxing time, but <F>ahm</F> we were quite <F>ah</F> sorry that we couldn't have <F>ah</F> <F>ahm</F> fresh air outside.Yes. I like sports. <F>Ahm</F> I like skiing,and I like diving,<F>ahm</F> scuba diving.And <F>ahm</F> every year, actually <R>my</R> <F>uh</F> my <R>friend</R> friend lives in <F>er</F> Nagano,so every year in summer, I visit him and <F>um</F> <F>er</F> we do camping outside just like this picture.<F>Ahm</F> I think <R>un</R> under the blue sky with fresh air,we can forget everything,<F>ahm</F> all troubles in reality. And <F>ahm</F> it's like a refreshmentthat you can never <SC>have in the</SC> have a <F>ahm</F> life. <?>O K</?>?<OL>O K, thank you</OL>.This weekend, we are going to visit <F>ahm</F> how can I say in English, <F>ahm</F> <R>wedding</R> wedding sights. It's not church, but <F>ahm</F> <R>like</R> like <OL><??></??></OL>.To <F>ahm</F> <F>ahm</F> decide everything <OL>for the wedding</OL>.<??></??>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
