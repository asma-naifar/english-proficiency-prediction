I was relax now.<F>Ah-hm</F>.It's, rain, snow?<F>Oh</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I bought <R>sho</R> short ski <F>uh</F> two weeks ago and yes <R>I</R> I usually go to snow mountain,for example, to Nigata prefecture. <F>Uh</F> I have a <SC>dro</SC> a car, so I will go to Nigata with my friends. <F>Uh</F> <F>eh</F> <R>it</R> it takes two hours or three hours to get to the ski place.<F>Ah</F> yes, and <SC>maybe</SC> usually, <F>ah</F> I will go to Nigata <F>eh</F> at night of Friday and I can reach there <F>ah</F> <R>in mo</R> in morning of Saturday.
