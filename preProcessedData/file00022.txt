 my name is .
 yes. I taught English at the vocational school I work for. So I didn't have class at University, but I did have 
to teach.
 yeah, I taught.
 I have been teaching English to eighteen or nineteen-year-old students for three years. And before that, yeah, I used to teach English to Japanese children for just one year.
So yeah.
 yes. It is very hard how do I keep balance is just to work in the daytime and take some classes at University at night. and then I'm married, so I have to do at home.
So it's a kind of hard.
Yeah.
O K. I live with my husband and my parents. So if I'm not at home, my father cooks for my husband, not my mother. And yeah, we don't have any children and we don't have any plan to have a children in near future. but we enjoy our life very much. And my husband works for a Japanese government, and he comes back home around eleven o'clock everyday, so yeah, he has a very hard day as as me.
I live in City, Prefecture.
My nearest station is Station
on Line.
Yes, I have. I lived in when I was a child for five years.
. only.
.
Yes, I have lots of memory about because I lived in from eight year old to thirteen years old.
So almost of my life of elementary school is in . . . Yeah. you know, when I asked by someone about living the life in , it reminds me very wonderful time in my life with my parents and my sister. Yeah. it was very yeah, special, it was totally different from the life in Japan.
 the weather was very different. is always hot summer weather, so still now, they don't have any winter season. So yeah. .
 I went to Japanese school. And I could use Japanese in the school, so I didn't have any difficulty learning something or yeah, being in that situation.
Yeah.
.
Yeah.
O K. there is a woman sitting on a chair. She faces a computer. And near her, there are a dog and a cat. The dog is sitting on the floor and the cat is lying on the bed. And she talks to the cat probably. And in her room, there are some books on the shelf, and there is also a telephone on the shelf. near the computer, there is a typewriter. It is red. the red typewriter is near the computer. and there are some speakers in the cassette tape recorder or something, yeah, on the book shelf. And on the wall, there is a clock. It says it's eight o'clock now. Then O K, O K, and she is wearing a green sweater and a blue skirt. I don't think she wears some socks. .

 when I use my computer, I usually use word processor software. It is called Word. using a soft, Word, I sometimes make some documents or some, teaching materials
 my students.
Yeah. I sometimes write some letters to my friends.
Yeah.
Yes and yeah, as well as snail mail.
Yeah.
happier. you know, in my opinion, using computer is very yeah, convenient because when we want to write a letter, like sending a e-mail or sending a greeting card we can write a letter or a message quickly without any paper or a pen. And we don't have to send the envelope. we don't have to put a envelope in the post box.
And so it is very convenient and then my friends or other people who gets my e-mail or letter, greeting cards quickly. So I often send many messages to many friends. So probably my relationship with my friends are yeah, getting broadened.

Hello.
 I bought this sweater.
But when I went back to my house and I tried on that sweater, I don't like the color. So may I ask you to change this one to another color?
 really? O K. When I came to this shop to buy this sweater, I asked another clerk to find the red one,
but yeah, she said she didn't have a red sweater at that time.
So I didn't have any choice to buy a red sweater. So that's why I bought a yellow sweater, this one. but I can find a red sweater over there on the shelf, so may I check the size of that sweater? If it says M, I think I have a right to get that one because I wanted to buy a red sweater at first.
 really? but and the sign of the red sweater says five thousand yen and I bought this one in six thousand yen.
So I'm O K if you give me a red sweater with no extra money. I mean I'm O K if you don't get me one thousand yen and a red sweater if you get me a .
 I beg your pardon? 
.
.
 O K.
 that's O K if I can get a red one.
 
. Yes.

So Ken went to pick Yumi up at her house, and they went to a zoo near, O K, University. and at the of lions, they found a biggest lion just in front of them. And the lion in front of them seems to be smile to them. So they're very happy to see it and talk about it yeah, and then Yumi said she wanted to see monkeys. So Ken took her to the of monkeys. and they found a monkey on the branch of the tree. And that monkey was eating a banana. Yeah. His face is very similar to Ken's father's face. So Ken said to Yumi he wanted to tell the faces monkey to his father when he goes back to home. So they had a really wonderful day in the zoo. But it is still in the afternoon, so they had some time to go another place. So Ken invited Yumi to go to a coffee shop. So they went there and had a good time there.

Most of the people sit on a bench with the same sex.
