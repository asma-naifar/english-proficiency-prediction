So this is kind of the same <F>ah</F> time for the people who are living in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> <R>ar</R> area.No. <SC>I just move</SC> <F>ah</F> I moved from <H pn="company name1">XXX07</H> to <?><H pn="others3">XXX05</H></?> head office, <F>mm</F> <R>in</R> in nineteen ninty-nine, <F>ah</F> sorry, <F>er</F> last year. And, when I was in <H pn="others5">XXX08</H>, I <R>built my</R> built my house, and my family is living in that my house. Therefore I cannot move <F>uh</F> the house. That means I have to commute to head office from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> <?>station</?>.Yes.Every morning and every evening.<F>Ah</F> usually from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> to <H pn="others6">XXX09</H> station, <SC>I took</SC> I take <F>mm</F> <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> line or <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> line whichever, <F>ah</F> if the time is available <??></??>. <F>Eh</F> but, as far as I take, <F>uh</F> <SC>Shinkan</SC> <F>ah</F> <H pn="others7">XXX10</H> line, <?>it</?> is very, how can I say, <F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <?>jammed</?>. <SC>People are very</SC> <F>er</F> how can I say, many people are in the same compartment. But, in case of Shinkansen, <R>I can</R> I can relax on the seat, so it is very nice.<CO><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is</CO>. <F>A</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ah</F>. Actually, <R>I</R> I have been living in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> for five years, <F>a</F> not five years, six years. And <R>my</R> <F>eh</F> my country is Kyusyu, so <SC>I'm not su</SC> <SC>I'm not so</SC> I'm not aware of <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> city very well, but <F>mm</F> it is very nice city. And <SC>as you know</SC> as you may know that <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>. From <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>, we can see the <H pn="others8">XXX11</H> and also <H pn="others09">XXX12</H> <OL>in the winter season</OL>.And <F>eh</F> when we <F>eh</F> <SC>go to shopping</SC> go shopping in <JP><F>eeto</F></JP>, <H pn="others10">XXX13</H> or <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> by the train, so it is very convenient.Yeah. Kyusyu, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>hum</F> Kyusyu. What kind of <F>uhu</F> <R>s</R> story do you like to hear?<OL>Weather function</OL> or the people's nature. <CO>Or the</CO>.Childhood? O K. <F>Mm</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> yes, O K. <F>Ah</F> when I was in Kyusyu, <F>uhu</F> in Kyusyu, <F>ah</F> maybe, you can imagine that there are many mountains <JP>ne</JP>. And <SC>Kyusyu is very</SC> <F>a</F> Kyusyu is a island, so <F>eh</F> my hometown is <F>uh</F> located near the riverside and also the mountainside. So I have <SC>five</SC> <F>er</F> four brothers, and usually I <SC>play</SC> played around with my <F>uh</F> brothers, <SC>mountain</SC> <F>ah</F> climb mountain and also fishing in the river. So <SC?>ma</SC?> <F>uh</F> when I was child, <F>uh</F> I was surrounded, <R>by</R> by the many natures. And that is <F>a</F> <SC?>th</SC?> totally different in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is located in the very flat land. So, <R>when</R> <SC>when ne</SC> when I try to go to mountain <SC>I have to take</SC> <F>uhu</F> I have to drive my car for <SC>more than <SC>one</SC> <SC>an</SC> one</SC> more than two hours <JP>ne</JP>.Yeah. That is the totally different.<nvs>cough</nvs><F>Hum</F>. What kind of description shall I tell you <OL><??></??> <?>I do</?></OL>?About the city <JP>ne</JP>. O K. <F>Mm</F>. <.></.> <F>Mm-huh</F>. <.></.> O K. <F>Eh</F> this city is <F>ah</F> <SC>between the big</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>bet</R> between the river, and <F>uhu</F> there are one station, <R>tra</R> train station and <F>uhu</F> <F>uhu</F> banks in front of the station. It's <F>er</F> available and very convenient for the people living in this city. And also, <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> very big supermarket is available, and, <F>er</F> near the supermarket, the movie theater is also. <F>Oh</F> you can enjoy the movie theater near the supermarket <JP>ne</JP>. <R>And</R> <F>hum</F> <.></.> and hospital and school and public library is also in the same line. So, when you try to, <F>uhu</F> go to the official, <F>uhu</F> how can I say, buildings or the <F>ah</F> governmental <F>uhu</F> buildings, it is convenient for you. <F>Hum</F>. <.></.> And <SC>there are</SC> <F>ah</F> this city has <F>uh</F> many <F>eh</F> greens, so <R>a</R> almost all the places you can see the trees <?>on</?> the buildings. And <SC>the</SC> in the <F>ah</F> bottom south of the city, <SC>there are</SC> <F>a</F> there is a big <F>er</F> route four hundred forty four. So <F>n</F> the inside the city, <F>ah</F> I guess there is not so, <F>oh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> sorry, <F>ah</F> the <SC>route forty</SC> <F>eh</F> route four hundred forty four is winding in the south, so you can access this <F>uhu</F> big <F>er</F> route easily. <.></.> And, of course, <F>eh</F> you can take the train, and <SC>this train</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>sta</SC> <F>a</F> this station <SC>have</SC> <F>a</F> has six local lines, <F>eh</F> so <SC>you</SC> <F>er</F> five local lines, so, <SC>when you go</SC> <F>oh</F> <SC>to</SC> <F>uhu</F> when you are going to go anywhere you want, <F>uhu</F> you can take many kind of local lines.<F>Hum</F>.Yeah. I guess it is very well-designed <JP>ne</JP> because offices and banks <R>are</R> are building neighboring each other, and also, school and public library and hospital are also very close. So, this is very <F>eh</F> well-designed I think.Yeah. <F>Ah</F> school and hospital must be available <R>within</R> <F>eh</F> within, at least, twenty minutes <SC>by</SC> on foot, and also, the <R>su</R> supermarket should be located <JP>ne</JP> <R>nea</R> <SC>near</SC> around my house. And other things are not so important for me because we can take cars <??></??>. There are many bus and trains, <SC>so</SC> but, at least, <F>uh</F> when I consider my daughter, <F>ah</F> school and other public <F>uhu</F> offices must be <F>er</F> <?>or</?> should be closer for my daughter and my wife.Yes.<F>A</F> hello, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sorry, <F>er</F> I couldn't go the party. <F>Mm</F>. <CO><?>So</?></CO>.
