O K. One day last week, a father and his son in went to the restaurant to celebrate his birthday. O K. When they enter the restaurant, father pointed out some seats for them. . Maybe, they have reserved, yes, I guess. The father have reserved the seat for them. At seat, they ordered some foods, some chickens, some beers. And they had a very good time talking about their family. . Her mother and sister is not right there because they have to go some other places. So only father and son was celebrating his son's birthday. And his son was very satisfied. He was very full. son went home. But father went to work, 
. last Saturday. Yeah. Last Saturday.

We aren't Catholic, but she is Catholic. and we had a about two hours lunch in Otani, wear good suits. And we had a very traditional Japanese food, , my father and me because it's so small amount. I don't know why we choose that, but, yeah, my mother want eat a Japanese food. But she is not feeling very well. . He is about fifty years old, and I don't know the exact word for, you know, women have some difficulty, maybe, in their first stage of fifties. I think she is going through that difficulty. So we arrange the food more light foods. and then, yeah, for two hours. We had talked about our family. Now, I'm twenty-five. When, you know, you were ten years old, this small, "Hey, don't tell me about that.".
