So  taking a walking in a rainy day.           after  walking  for a minute,   something crying in a box  beside the road. So "What happened?" the young man listened to the noise. This looks like  cats  crying.  so look around   where is the crying from?". So   a wife found the box beside the road, and sit down ,    open the box.    , can I say  present ? So    she  opened the box, and she    found a little   not puppy, a   baby cat.  then she took up  him, small one. So she asked him   could I take this   poor cat to our home?" she asked. But  he  refused  her request, because they're  living in the apartment. The apartment  didn't take care  any pets. So  of course, he  want to take care the cat  either, but rule is rule, so     they are thinking about the   little cats. But problem is not  resolved anything. So anyway,  they took the  box in a cat to their apartment,   then decided   the first,  we are going to take  this little poor cat.  next, we are discussed about the cat,  asking to take care that   any friend or their parents, the home, or asking to care  another person's,    pin up the supermarket the memo  "Please take care the little    little cat.".      we have to  research the any way of take care another person  about this little cat.
