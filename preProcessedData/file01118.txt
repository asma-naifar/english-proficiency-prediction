 yeah. The big difference is the  power because   have</SC>  the students have  so much power compared to the Japanese guy.
 I have never  suffered from the such a    hard body check or something. And  yeah,  in the example,  in a game, and  I suffered from the hard body check. And  after that,  I couldn't stand up there about  ten seconds.
 breathe, and also, after the game,  I watched my  helmet and  the face guard was bended.
 yeah,  but you know,
the   face guard made of the  titanium, but  titanium was bended. Yeah. Yeah. They have so much power.
Yeah.

 I see.  but    I couldn't wear this shirts so, if so, I have to throw away this shirts   yeah, but   I tried of just one time, so   I would like to change.
   no,  but   in a store,  I just look, and  I bought this shirts. .
Yes. I didn't try 
 and  after that, I went back to my  house, and  I tried, but  I couldn't.

Biggest thing.  What?      I didn't buy big stuff.   because     I was student.  .
Yes, that's right.
But,  sometimes I went to  restaurant with my friend, Japanese restaurant.
. Japanese restaurant was a quite expensive in  Cincinnati.
Yeah, just a  or some kind of bowl,  it cost me about  fifteen or twenty dollars.  it was kind of
 me. 
.

All right. O K.   one day last week,  I went to  station to go to  my customer's office. And   I was waiting for a train, but  next person, he pushed me, and  I    yeah, my luggage to the    railroad.   I complained  the next person, but    he just say, " I'm sorry.   I'm sorry. I didn't push.". So,  I complained again and again, but  it was no meaning.   and  suddenly,  one of the trains come to the  station.  I was shocked because   my luggage was still  on the  railroad,   but, fortunately,  my bag was  in the middle of the   railroad, so there was  nothing to happen,  and   I asked  station staff, and   he  tried to pick up my luggage. And,  the someone . 
Yeah.
.
All right.
, too crowd.
In Tokyo?
Worst part.  Yeah. Worst part.  yeah, worst part is  I think worst part is  too crowd in train. And  yeah, example, when I was a high school student, and  yeah,      train  which was  I wanted to  ride off the  station, but   I couldn't go out from the train. But    I tried  to tell the person, "  I want to  ride off the train.   yeah, could you pass me  somethings?".    but  they ignored me.
Yeah, so, it is kind of the  worst thing in the train.
 crowd. .
Yeah.

department, so the department, the goal is  to find a new business,
