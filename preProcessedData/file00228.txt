But it seems a     boy   doesn't agree.  but   the girl   asked him   . .  . So,   finally,  perhaps,  he agree her    idea. So    they  go back to their house  with a small cat. 
Yes.  one dog.
.  I think   advantage   feeling so good for especially for our children.  .  As you know, high school and junior high schools  childrens, their feeling so very,    nervous or    it's a very difficult situation now. But          they enjoy  with the dog. I think  only advantage is    children's feeling good.
New Year's?
. No, I have no plan in New Year's vacation. But    my brother  come back to      this   New Year's vacation from .
Maybe,    we are going to  join with the dinner or   go to shrine or temple with them.
