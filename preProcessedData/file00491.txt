I'm fine, thank you. It's really  hot today, but I had a good day.
My name is .
Yes, please.

I think so.

. Yes. . I'm working for a U S consulting firm.   as a secretary.
Yes. . I'm an assistant to  administrative  manager  who is in charge of  our office administration. And      I support her.
. Doing my job? . Difficulties? . No, not at this moment. I'm  handling it. I think  well myself.
Yes. . I love jogging. And I normally jog  for like two hours on week ends. And, last year, I ran the marathon for the first time in my life.
. Yes. I completed  barely, at the time of five hours.
. I just felt happy that  I accomplished something   that's very said to be very hard.
. I'm thinking about participating in New York marathon.
This year.
. Marathon. . . When you run a certain distance,  I think something  comes out from your brain called   adrenaline. And it makes me feel  so good.
. I originally from . . . I live in  now.
. . I've only been living in  for one year. So I don't know much about this city yet.
    it's a very convenient place to live.
.
. Yes.
. There is a couple  having a dinner time  in the restaurant.  they are dressed very nicely. And they seemed to be celebrating,   maybe, their   wedding anniversary. And    waiter is about to serve  the gentleman  bottle of wine that he ordered.   and this gentleman is  about to taste it.  .  Yes.

. Red wine is O K. But  I sometime  find it very bitter. Yes.
. . I think because the price is going down. . And there are many  cheap but delicious wines   coming from  foreign countries. And I think this one of the reason why it's been so popular.
.
Yes.
Hello, -. . I'm sorry that I missed the dinner party last night. .  I was really looking forward to that party but, unfortunately, my boss    had an urgent  job to complete, and I had to assist her.
I'm sorry I forgot to  take your  phone number with me  last night. And I just had no way to contact you.

Thank you for your patience.
Good-bye.
O K.
. Yes.   . Because  I've been  working  hard  lately,  I always make an appointment with my friends. But   there are many times that I have to cancel this appointments due to my workload.
 . I normally  phone my friends' mobile to keep them informed  that I can't come.
.
? .  Memorable party? .  . Yes. It would be a Christmas party that we had  two years ago  in my office. I was one of the committee. . And  we had to  think of the way to entertain a hundred and thirty  people. It was a big party. And we had to stay  late to prepare for that party. But  everybody seemed to enjoyed that party. And  I myself had a good time, too.
O K.
Yes. . One day  last week, I was driving a car. And this man  came on a bike  with a mobile phone on his hand. .   he was calling someone  by that mobile.   and, suddenly, he dropped this mobile, and the mobile hit my car.  And also,  my car hit  part of his   motor bicycle. And    this man claimed that  it was my fault. .  but I called the policeman  to let him judge  whose fault it was.  finally,   the police  wrote a report  that  it was this  motor bicycleman's fault. And     his bicycle   was picked by the vendor  to go to the maintenance.

Car accident?
. Yes. I had been accident once. .  I was not a driver, but my mother was driving a car. And she was about to park  her car in the parking lot. But she misjudged the distance. . And she hit the pole in front of her. And    a rear glass  broke just a bit. But no one was hurt.
. Yes. . First of all,  you'd better call the policeman. And let him  explain what happened. And, secondly,  if you have an  insurance company,    that is  reachable for twenty hours. Maybe, you can call  them to get help. And   they'll tell you  what you should do. .
Yes.
.
After this interview,  I think I'll straightly  go to the health club and  just  jog for an hour. 
. .
.
Thank you, too.
Good-bye.
