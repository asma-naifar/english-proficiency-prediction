<OL><F>Er</F></OL> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX01</H>. <nvs>cough</nvs>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Hobbies? <F>Mm</F> my hobby is <F>er</F> yachting. <F>Ah</F> it's, <F>er</F> you know, <F>er</F> it's very difficult to pronounce. And the yachting is like a boat and ship and I like <F>erm</F> the <R>ma</R> marine sports very much.<F>Oh</F> since I graduated from my university, <F>er</F> I have been doing nothing about yachting, so<OL>now</OL> I have no place to do <OL><F>eh</F></OL>yachting.So, <F>mm</F> when I was a member of the university <F>er</F> a yachting club, <F>em</F> <F>er</F> I always do a yachting in <F>mm</F> maybe <F>ehm</F> many people call the place <F>er</F> the <H pn="others1">XXX02</H>,<F>Ah</F> <SC>it's a</SC> it's like a seaside area <F>mm</F> in <H pn="others2">XXX03</H> Prefecture.Yes.<F>Erm</F> it was like <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> seven or eight years ago, so I <F>er</F> started to play yachting <F>mm</F> <.></.> <F>ah</F> the first year of my university. <OL><F>Ah</F></OL>.Yachting? <F>Mm</F> it's like a sports with nature. <F>Er</F> I like <F>mm</F> yachting has no <F>mm</F> mobile, <F>aa</F> <R>I</R> I mean, like a engine motorcycle or something like that. So therefore, <F>nn</F> <R>yacht</R> <F>err</F> yacht moves only with the <F>ah</F> wind and <F>er</F> the power of nature and the power of the waves. <F>Er</F> <F>mm</F> in anyway, <SC>it's very</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ah</F> it's like a fight with the nature.<OL><?>That's why</?></OL> it's very interesting.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>Family? <F>Erm</F> I have a one elder sister and she is six years <F>er</F> older than my, and <F>ah</F> I have father and mother, and that's all. <F>Er</F> I am the youngest son.Yes.Sister? <F>Hum</F> <SC>my sister</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> I really love my sister. <F>Hm</F> <R>she</R> she has taught me a lot about <F>er</F> <F>er</F> how to <SC>do</SC> <F>ah</F> deal with <F>er</F> other people. And so I have a problem in my heart to do with <F>er</F> <F>ah</F> <R>people</R> or <F>er</F> majority of the people. So <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>she is very kind like <F>ah</F> open</SC> <F>eh</F> <SC>she has</SC> <F>eh</F> she is very open-minded people. So <SC>I have</SC> I learned a lot from my sister. <F>Um</F> the last October, <F>er</F> her baby was born, <F>mm</F> <R>he</R> <R>he</R> <F>ah</F> he is only <SC>a</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>two month</SC> <F>er</F> two months old and <SC>sh</SC> he is very cute. And then <SC>it's</SC> <F>ah</F> since last August, I went to <F>er</F> United States to study English <F>um</F> because of the English training curriculum <R>in thi</R> in this company. So <F>hmm</F> I stayed there like four month and then so <F>mm</F> I came back to Japan <F>er</F> December twenty-fourth, and it was my first time to see <F>ah</F> her baby.Yes, she was like a mother. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes.Yeah.Describe? <laughter>Yeah</laughter>. So, <F>mm</F> it is very shiny day and <F>mm</F> maybe I think <F>urm</F> this is Saturday or Sunday. It's like a weekend or <F>er</F> during the vacation. Many people <R>are</R> are relaxed and <F>er</F> <SC>they are playing</SC> the kids are playing the volleyball <F>er</F> on <SC>the park</SC> <F>ah</F> the garden. And <R>one girl</R> <F>er</F> one girl <SC>playing</SC> <F>hm</F> is playing, I don't know how to call <nvs>laughter</nvs> maybe she is playing with a rope, <F>hm</F> I'm not sure. So, <F>er</F> maybe they are mother or some <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> neighborhood so in anyway <SC>they</SC> <F>ah</F> mothers are talking each other about <F>mm</F> everyday life or something like that. And one <.></.> guy is jogging <F>er</F> in front of the <F>er</F> houses. And <F>er</F> one old guy is relaxed <F>er</F> with reading the newspaper.Yes.With my neighborhood? Yes. In these days, <F>mm</F> <R>I don't see</R> <F>er</F> I don't see often <F>ah</F> the boys playing <F>eh</F> each other on the outside. So I mean <F>er</F> I guess they are playing in the inside of the house. <F>Eh</F>, <R>They</R> they are playing the computer game and so <.></.> it's like <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> maybe <F>er</F> five or six years ago, I think. And <F>er</F> <SC>these houses are</SC> these houses have a very <F>er</F> large garden <F>er</F> so <F>er</F> <SC>the guys and</SC> the boys and girls have a lot of opportunity to play in the outside, I think. <R>And</R> <F>mm</F> <.></.> and the road in front of the house <F>ah</F> is very wide and <F>er</F> <SC>in</SC> <F>ah</F> as for my house, <F>er</F> we have a very small road in front of <SC>my hou</SC> our house. And <F>mm</F> there is no place to play <F>er</F> <F>ah</F> tennis <F>ah</F> or some sports like that.So, it's really good place to live, I think.So <F>mm</F> I'm late. So, I'm sorry, <F>er</F> I have <F>er</F> <F>er</F> a train ticket for the last train <SC>so</SC> but <F>mm</F> <F>er</F> I'm in a hurry to go to <F>nn</F> the next place, so please change my <SC>air</SC> <F>er</F> ticket to the next train.Is that your company policy? Why? I don't understand you because <F>urm</F> <SC>why</SC> I would like to explain why I'm late. So, I have a business appointment <F>erm</F> <.></.> the last thirty minutes so <F>er</F> and I have next appointment in <F>er</F> another company <F>mm</F> so <F>er</F> <SC>we will</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I have to feedback <F>er</F> our opinion to the next <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> appointment at the business meeting, so it's very big project, <.></.> I think. <F>Erm</F> maybe if we will succeed in the next business, so maybe we can <F>erm</F> <F>um</F> feedback to <R>a lot</R> a lot of people our money and a lot of opportunity to something, maybe. I cannot tell you about what you can do <F>er</F> after that. So in anyway, <SC>it's a very</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>it's</R> it's a very big project and maybe <SC>if you sto</SC> <F>mm</F> if you don't let me <SC>go to the <F>er</F> change</SC> go to the next train or don't give me a next train ticket, <SC>so you will have</SC> <F>er</F> <R>you</R> you will <F>mm</F> lost a very big <laughter>big</laughter> opportunity and <SC>big money</SC> huge money.Yes.<F>Ar</F> why you are talking about the rule? Because <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>I think</SC> <F>er</F> I understand your situation but <F>mm</F> on the other hand, you are one of the citizen and maybe you are <F>er</F> like our customer. So, <F>mm</F> please compare <SC><R>which</R> which has a per</SC> <F>eh</F> which has a priority. <F>Er</F> <R>do</R> do you really have to keep your rule because <F>eh</F> <SC>I'm</SC> <F>er</F> as I told you, it's a very very big business, <F>er</F> not only <R>fo</R> for you but also for the many many people, a majority of the citizens in this city. <nvs>sigh</nvs><OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<OL><F>Mhm-huh</F></OL>.Yes?O K.<OL>Please do</OL>.<OL><?>Bye</?></OL>.Airplane? No, actually not.<OL><F>Mm</F></OL> but I had a very big <F>mm</F> difficulty to <F>mm</F> communicate with <SC>foreign</SC> <F>er</F> American people <F>ah</F> <SC>in ca</SC> <F>er</F> for example, <R>when</R> when I <SC>went to the</SC> went to a car service to rent a car, <F>er</F> it was very hard negotiation because <F>mm</F> it was my first time to do that. And <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I didn't know <F>urm</F> <SC>how to do</SC> how to rent a car. And I don't have <F>mm</F> <F>ah</F> social <F>er</F> security number or something like that. <CO>So <F>mm</F> they required me <SC>a lot of <F>ah</F> about</SC> a lot about <F>ah</F> personal information, but <SC>I didn't</SC> <F>ah</F> I couldn't <F>mm</F> tell them about my personal <F>er</F> information so</CO>. And I only had a like an international driver's license. <CO>So it was <F>er</F> the</CO>. <CO>Have you ever seen the Japanese international <OL>dri</OL></CO>.It was like a <F>ah</F> just small piece of paper <nvs>laughter</nvs> and they don't believe, and <SC>it was</SC> <F>er</F> I think it was their first time to see the Japanese driver's license card so <F>er</F> maybe <R>they</R> they felt a lot of difficulities to deal with <F>mm</F> my case.One day <R>last week</R> last week.O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So the last week, I was driving a car. <F>Er</F> I had appointment with my girlfriend, but <F>mm</F> as <SC>I was</SC> I woke up late, and <F>er</F> <SC>I had to be in hurry</SC> I had to go <F>mm</F> in hurry to see my girlfriend, so I was driving a little bit faster than <F>er</F> <F>er</F> before or usually. So <F>um</F> <F>er</F> while I was driving on the road, <F>mm</F> the one guy, <F>mm</F> it was like very young guy <F>er</F> and maybe he didn't pay much attention on <F>er</F> other cars or another people. <F>Er</F> maybe <SC>I</SC> he look like a <F>er</F> driving with <R>sing</R> <F>er</F> singing. And suddenly <F>er</F> when I <F>mm</F> tried to turn left on the corner of the <F>er</F> road, <F>er</F> we hit each other. <F>Er</F> <SC>so one</SC> <F>er</F> so that young guy was <F>er</F> driving <F>mm</F> <SC>the bicycle</SC> <R>mo</R> motorcycle. So <F>mm</F> but as I was in hurry, <F>er</F> <SC>I didn</SC> <F>er</F> I also didn't <SC>pay a lot</SC> <F>mm</F> pay much attention <SC>on the <F>er</F> bicycle</SC> on <F>er</F> motorcycle. So, <R>I</R> I guess <F>mm</F> it was <F>er</F> my fault, <nvs>sigh</nvs> but <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> the young guy <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <SC>tol</SC> <F>mm</F> said to me <F>er</F> something very strongly so <F>mm</F> I get mad about that. So, even though <F>mm</F> <SC>it was</SC> <R>I</R> I felt like it was my fault, <F>er</F> I <F>er</F> replied to him very strongly. So, but <F>mm</F> <SC>we cannot</SC> <F>er</F> we couldn't <F>er</F> negotiate like <F>er</F> <SC>usual situation</SC> under the usual situation. <R>Each</R> each guy, <F>mm</F> me and <F>er</F> him, he <F>er</F> got mad very strongly. So <F>mm</F> <F>urm</F> <R>someome</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> someone <F>er</F> who passed by us <F>er</F> called the police <F>er</F> instead of us. <SC>And</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>er</F> so <F>mm</F> <SC>within</SC> <F>er</F> after ten minutes, so the police came to us and <F>urm</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>he</SC> what <R>he</R> he did at first <F>er</F> first was <F>er</F> <.></.> to calm down us. <CO>So <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>we come on to</SC> <F>aa</F> we calmed down <laughter>and</laughter> we started to talk <F>er</F> like usual situation so</CO>. Then, <F>mm</F> <SC>because of my</SC> <JP><F>aa</F></JP> because of the arrangement of the police, <F>er</F> finally, we <F>er</F> agreed with each other and <F>er</F> I told him <SC>I pay</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I will</SC> I would pay a money <JP><F>ee</F></JP> <SC>for the</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> for the motorcycle in order to repair. <.></.> So finally, <F>er</F> he understood me and <F>er</F> <.></.> that's all. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>I'm sorry</OL>.<F>Er</F> I studied in the West Virginia.<F>Er</F> West Virginia is like <F>er</F> mountain city.No, no. There is no place to do that.Sports? <F>erm</F> I played soccer with my <F>er</F> university friends.<F>Ah</F> no, not American, so I attended <F>mm</F> <F>er</F> E S L, <SC>I</SC> <F>aa</F> English as a Second Language program. So unfortunately, <F>er</F> I couldn't find any American student because <F>er</F> they don't need to <F>er</F> <OL>learn English at university</OL>.<SC>So</SC> but <F>mm</F> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I got a lot of friends from <F>mm</F> South America,<SC>and so</SC> and <F>eh</F> Middle East and <R>A</R> Asian countries.Yeah, it's very unique and I learned a lot about the another <F>er</F> country's culture.Yes.<F>Ah</F> thank you very much.
