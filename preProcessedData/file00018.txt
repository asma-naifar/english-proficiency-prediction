 the good there is mountain area and also there is a beach. And you know you, can both enjoy the mountain and the ocean. Also, you have many temples, there are many temples there and so and historic site, so you can enjoy visiting those places.
 yes. . , and then I moved to when I was six years old and because of my father's business. And I came back to when I was ten years old. And then after that, I stayed for a while but then, when I was in junior high school, I moved to and lived there for three years. And then came back to again and went to high school and junior college sorry. And after I graduated from the junior college, I worked for a bank for a few years, and then I decided that I wanted to go to university again, so I came back to university.
. As I was little, so I do not remember that much but the climate is very hot there. And so it's like you know, the season is there are a lot of beautiful flowers and I think it used to be a colony of Spain, so there is Spanish culture and the Indian culture which used to be there.
 it is a restaurant, and sorry three couples are enjoying dinner. And couple sitting just in front of us is the wife is wearing pink suit and her husband is wearing yellow jacket. And the sommelier is standing besides the table. And he is explaining about the wine, and he's very content of the wine, and he says that "O K. I will have that". maybe the waiter will pour to her wife's glass, too. And in the restaurant, there is a piano and the piano is playing by herself.
.
 I strongly disagree with the situation because I think smoke will disturb if you don't like taste of foods.
So, I think the smoking and non-smoking should be separated.
 O K.

But I think sometimes lying is a good way to, you know, not always good to say the fact. So, I think sometimes you have to lie. So, sometimes it is effective to make a story.
 O K.
 one day, Ken was driving by himself. And there was a motor cycle was coming in front of him, and Ken accidentally crashed to the motor cycle. And and then Ken hit the back of the motor cycle and the man who was on the motor cycle was very angry about that. And they both argued. Ken just listening to his complaint. And he decided that it would be better to call policeman, so he called the police and then the policeman came. And a policeman came and ask Ken questions. And was that should be blamed. So he said that he will call the insurance company and cover the brought the motor cycle and fix it, and also with the service man. And they left the place of the accident. sorry I mistake.
, I mistook Ken to so the man was just looking, and the motor cycle went to the service station.
I used to drive.
 I had an accident. After that I stopped driving.
 not at all. I actually I was the one that should be blamed because I changed the line in the intersection. And I hit the car moving next my car. And but luckily no one was injured. But I was really afraid because I was moving not so slow. I mean, it was not to slowly. And if I maybe hit harder, the next car will, you know, crossed the line. And went to the opposite line, and then it will, you know, hit the collision. So, I was very scared since then I stopped driving by myself.
Yes, in . But it was just I was careless.
 plan for the new year? actually, maybe I cannot enjoy very much because I have some reports that I should finish. and also we have test after new year so maybe I have to study. But maybe I think we'll drink champagne in the new year's eve, enjoy a little bit.
Year two thousand.
Year, I guess so.
Thank you very much.
O K. Thank you.
