And there was a motor cycle was coming <R>in front</R> in front of him, and Ken accidentally crashed to the motor cycle.

Ken <SC>was listening</SC> just listening to his complaint. And he decided that it would be better to call policeman, so <R>he called</R> he called the police and then the policeman came. And a policeman came and ask Ken questions. And <R>Ken</R> <.></.> Ken thought that <R>it was</R> <.></.> it was him <SC>that was</SC> was <F>um</F> that should be blamed. So he said that he will call the insurance company and cover <R>the</R> the <.></.> <F>um</F> brought the motor cycle and fix it, and also <.></.> and he noticed that the motor cycle was out of order. And he couldn't move it any more. So he called to the service station, and the service man came, and came by a truck. And they put the motor cycle on the truck, and the man also went <R>with</R> with the service man. And they left the place of the accident. <SC>And they</SC> <F>ah</F> sorry I mistake.<laughter>Sorry</laughter>, I mistook Ken to <F>um</F> <SC>the man was</SC> <F>um</F> so the man was just looking, and the motor cycle went to the service station.<F>Uh</F>I used to drive.<F>Um</F> I had an accident. After that I stopped driving.<F>Ah</F> not at all. I actually <F>um</F> I was the one <SC>that was</SC> that should be blamed because I changed the line in the intersection. And I <R>hit the</R> hit the car <F>um</F> moving next my car. And but luckily <R>no one</R> no one was injured. But I was really <R>af</R> afraid because <F>um</F> I was moving not so slow. I mean, it was not to slowly. And if I maybe hit harder, the next car will, you know, crossed the line. And went to the <F>um</F> opposite line, and then it will, you know, hit the collision. So, I was very scared <SC>stop</SC> since then I stopped driving by myself.Yes, in <H pn="others6">XXX08</H>.
