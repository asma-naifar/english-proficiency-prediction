My name is .
 right now? I live in .
 I just moved here last August, and I don't really know like the town. But it's really convenient. there's lots of buildings near the station.
And there's lots of grocery stores and convenient stores.
.
 there's this big shopping
center
near the station and it has like many clothes and books and C Ds. But you can buy anything there and I like that .
.
 yeah, it's called the , I think. it sells clothes and accessories,
.
 the clothes are really cute and it's not really expensive so I can buy with my allowance.
.
 yeah, five thousand yen every month.
 I try not to spend too much on clothes and on what I want to buy because I have to afford all my clothes and shoes with the five thousand yen.
And I think a lot of it goes on food.
 like after school, we go somewhere.
.
 I'm not in any club so if I don't have any like catch-up classes after school, I go home and my friend's doing a band with her friends and I'm like the manager? I sort of help with the stages and the performances.
 what I do after school.
.
. .
 this is
 yeah, Japanese and there used to be mathematics but right now I'm only doing Japanese
because I can't keep up with the class right now I'm in. Because I haven't done the basic work the other students did in middle school and
up till September or so. it's the other nine months students are in the class, too. .
.
 I can ask a question if I don't understand the.
And yeah, I think it's better because there's not many like two or three people .
.
 .
 in middle school, I used to do badminton for two years. And I was doing a bass guitar
for one year. But but I thought of going to the badminton club, but I had the band with .
.
.
 this is a picture of a neighborhood. And do I describe like one thing at a time?
. on the sidewalk, there's a man jogging. And close to him, there are two boys passing the ball in a field. It's sort of like an open space near the house. In front of the house, there're two dogs staring at each other, I think. But I don't think they're really mad at each other because they're wagging their tails. in front of the large window in their house, there's girl jumping rope. And in front of them there are two women gossipping, I think. The woman wearing a pink suit take was taking her dog out for walk, I don't know.
 by near, a white car and there is a cat sleeping on top of it.
.
.
 my neighborhood that I used to live in wasn't this active. there were hardly any people because I think all my neighbors were pretty old like fifty or sixty. And all their children had gone elsewhere. And there weren't any kids around. And we lived in this, it's like a mansion, but there's only four families living in it. And there were no pets allowed so there weren't animals near. but besides the people and the animals, it looks pretty much the same.
 I think there were doctors and dentists and lots of people with professional stuff. and so I think they were working in their offices.
 they didn't really come out during the day time. But they seemed to stay up late at night.
It's pretty different. . 
 the roads aren't this wide, first of all. And there are small trees but not trees like these pine trees. And the houses aren't big either. They are like half or one-third the size of these. And yeah, there is lots of houses crunched up in one .
 I like to have a dog. And I always wanted a dog but I'm allergic to animals so I can't. And I wanna take them out for walk.
O K.
O K.
.
 I have this ticket for for the train, but I missed it. And I was wondering if I could either have our money back or just trade a ticket for the next train.
.
 today, I was supposed to wake up at seven but my alarm clock didn't go off. And my mother woke me up at eight. And right now I'm here. 
 I have to ride this train to go home in time for my cram school.

 it's my mathematics class and if I don't go for one lesson, I can't keep up with the next one. and yes. 
 but then can I buy the next for twenty-five percent off? 
 half the price.

.
Half the price and trade it?
. .
. .
O K. 
.
.
 O K.
.
 no, I used to live in America when I was small.
And in kindergarten, I used to do role-play, but not since then.
.
.
 if I miss the train, I just pay for the next .
 
 I think I .
 give up and call one of my friends or something to ask them to tell the teacher that I'll be late.
 I try to get my school work ready before I go to sleep so I don't have to like run around searching for books in the morning.
.
Yes.
 really big noise. 

. one day last week, a boy and his younger sister was walking home from school. it was raining and they were talking among themselves. But the boy heard a distant sound coming from somewhere. And he stopped to listen. wait, a stray cat inside of it. the sister asked the boy whether their parents would let them take the cat home. But boy knew that their mother and father was pretty strict so he said, "I don't think so.". And the sister was really disappointed and shocked because the cat was really like sick and starving and shivering. and she wouldn't go home unless the boy would let her take the cat home. finally, no, she had a fit saying that she wouldn't go home unless the boy let her take the cat home. Finally the boy gave in, and they went home taking the cat with them.
.
.
. .
 I used to like cats better than dogs. But my friend used to have a cat and she told me that they're like really free and they never come home
unless they want to. And it's self-centered, but when I'm there I want a pet to be with me. So
I heard the dogs were better at that than cats.
 .
 they're .
 they are animals, but they have lives, too. And I don't think you should leave them, you know.
. I know I can't have them at my home. So I think I look for someone who wanted a cat. And like kids or yeah. And the last thing I do is leave them there.
I think I'll take them home and try like just for a little while keep him, then look for another owner.
.
Yes, .
 I wanna finish my homework so I think I'll stay after school a little.
.
Because the books are heavy
and I don't wanna take .
.
 Japanese.
 then not normal, but old Japanese, .
.
 yeah, class, yeah.

Yeah.
.
 thank you.
