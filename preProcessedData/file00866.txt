.   one  old gentleman and    young guy  seems to go to the  restaurant. And     they have entered the restaurant and ask boy their seat is available or not. Then, the boy  actually  introduced them one of the table.  And they are choosing  food. Excuse me. I'm very nervous.
I'm a very poor imaginator.
  they asked the waiter   to have the menu, and they started to choose  food and drink.  And     one person  chosed the chicken with bone,   and   one person ordered the fish meat.
And   young person  also had a beer, and old  gentleman ordered the  maybe juice.  Actually,    they finished to eat. Then,  they have paid their bill   at the registration.   what can I say,  both people    feel satisfaction because they  ate a lot.  and then, finally,   went back their home.


  you mean the junk food?
  actually,  in America, there are many of choices, compare with United  Kingdom.
 like  a hamburger and Italian restaurants there, Japanese restaurant there. So, whatever we want, we could  eat there. .  So, America is   really  much of choice, compared with  U K.
 specially,    Italian pizza is very cheap in United States.
Yeah. . The cost is only six fifty U S dollar  per piece. Per piece means, maybe,   ten inches pizza  only  is six fifty.
Then,   we can share one pizza for two or three person. That's very  cheap there.
