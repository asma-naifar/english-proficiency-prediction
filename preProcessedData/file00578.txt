 it's very difficult to explain, but   the      taste of soup is different.
    the both tastes are taken from fishes, of course. But   Japanese taste is taken from  and   Thai taste is taken other fishes.  I don't know the name of the fish. But the different is so.  and  I realized one more thing. And  , yes. Japanese people like . And Thailand people like  also. But   Japanese  is made of beans, and Thailand  is made of fish.
