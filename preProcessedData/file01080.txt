so,  , that might gives me  . .
 Yeah.

Yes.
 really hate it, you know. Usually,  some Japanese people hit my shoulder, my back,
don't even say, "Sorry, excuse me.". That's my stress right now.
That's the only one stress. 
Worst.
.
People started to fighting
in the train.
.  Yeah, two guys and one of them pushed the other one. . That guy hit  and step on my  shoe,
but, yeah, he didn't care about that, so
 is dangerous .
. You know. I push him back.
 when I was in America,
I was thinking, you know, Japanese people are always polite.
Yeah.  Everyone is nice to .
 but when I came back,
especially   when I stay in those crowded train,
 ,   I was wrong. That's right. .
All right.
.
. 
So
.   I have to make story.
 here. Yeah.

. All right. . It's raining today. "Listen, do you hear something?". "Do you think so?". "Yeah. Look at this box.  This is a cat.". " he is so poor.  I see.". " please. I wanna have this cat.". ".". " please,  . I'll take care of him everyday.". "O K. You promise me?". "Yes, I will.". "All right.". "Thank you very much. Let's go home. Give him some milk.".  ".". 

Yes. I have a cat.
Yes.
How?
 He was there when I was born. 
Yes.
Then,  he died when I was  sixth grades or so.
He  pretty much long.
 because at that time,
I cried so much and,  yeah, I just can't forget that kind of feeling.  I loved him, and I took care of him a lot, but  when he died,  I feel like empty so,  I don't wanna feel anymore. 
Really?
.
.  Because I don't like dog.
 When dog  gets hungry,  they do,  like, you know, "Give me something give me something," but cats, they don't do that. .
 Sometimes they, you know, touch my foot,
then but usually  when I call him, "Come here, come here,"
he watches me but he ignores me.
That's why I like .
? But you know. That's why I like cat.
 Cat is better than dog. 
I know people say, " you are crazy,  you are so strange.". But,
 it's been so. 
All right.
. Friday night,
I drunk too much.
And when I get home, it was   ten o'clock A. M. on   Saturday.
 Then, I couldn't sleep because I had to go to Yokohama with my friend.
So   I play  at Yokohama with my friend until   about evening.
Then, I had dinner with my friend. Then I get home around  eight or nine.
I  went to bed, yes.
And woke up,  .
.
 didn't do almost nothing.
.
Sorry. 
Yeah.
