Yes. Sure.
 no. Not so busy.
But I just took mistakes at the time of reservation. So, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to come there ten thirty, but I thought it eleven, so I'm sorry for that.
. Yes.
Yeah, many plans. Especially today and tomorrow, on Saturday, Sunday .
Yes.
. O K. one of my plans, maybe Saturday eighteenth, I attended to private school I don't know how to say, the student who failed the university's entrance examination and after that, have to study for one year. I don't know how to say. But private schools, and I attended the private school for one year and there're classmates and from my hometown. So Saturday we'll meet in and we will have the party with them. So, I'm very looking forward to have the party and talk with them. Yes.
.
Maybe one of my classmate. Goro, the very famous Japanese talent. So Goro-. Everyone says "Goro-". So he arranged this party.
.
 the other political groups or the other groups. If the student have a strong active mindness, or other student who try to interact with other people, if the student have these kind of spirit or tried to effort, the college effort everything. But do not have these kind of effort, the college does not offering anything. But the most people said that is corrupt because there're so many problems occurred. But I think that this is one good aspect and the student face with the reality before we will enter the real world. But the university is not real world, but that before we will enter the real world, maybe compared with the high school student, I think that I will face with the reality. meet with many many different kind of people and many good my professors so I think that offered many various opportunity to, yeah, enjoy it.

 my hometown is countryside, so now I live in by myself. I rent my apartment in City and very good time in my apartment. I have two pets, cat and dogs. And I have computer laptop. And also I have the telephone and the C D players, so I enjoy even all day long inside my room. So, even Saturday or Sunday, my room is very nice. So I could enjoy stay in my room all day long.
Yes.
 actually, after I entered the university, I started to use e-mail. So it is very easy to communicate with the other people even if they live the not . So it is very easy to contact with the other people, but on the other hand, these kind of relationship is very easy to break up. because the communicate by e-mail is very easy so it is also easy to break up. So, after using computer and sending e-mail, tool has changed by using the computer.
