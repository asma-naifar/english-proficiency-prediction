So I'm very upset and the shouted to him because I'm very upset, because my bag fall into the rails. <SC>So</SC> but <R>o</R> <R>o</R> of course, he could not understand what he should do, <SC>and</SC> so I asked <R>the</R> the staff of the station. And the <R>staff</R> staff of the station, he helped me to <SC>bring my bag into</SC> <R>bring m</R> bring <.></.> my bag. And <R>a</R> <SC>at this</SC> from this moment, I decided to <.></.> bring my bag so tightly even if the <R>someone hi</R> <SC>someone hits</SC> someone's legs, no, <SC>arm</SC> <.></.> arms hitted me. <SC>If</SC> <.></.> <R>I <.></.> decided</R> I decided to <.></.> bring my bag so tightly <SC>in the</SC> <.></.> in that is.<CO>It is a</CO>.<F>Mhmm</F> <.></.> I live in <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> City, and <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> my <H pn="others4">XXX07</H> line started from <R><H pn="others3">XXX06</H></R> <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> Station, so <SC>I'm</SC> <R>for</R> fortunately, I can sit the seat.
