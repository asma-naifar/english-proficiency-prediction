Turn by turn.

O K. One day last week, can I say she I?
. One day last week, I went to a department store to buy a present for my husband. it's happy birthday present. I want to give my husband a good tie. So I went to gentleman's yeah, section in the department. And then I selected the good one. it's a green tie. And then I bought the present for my husband. I went another section, there was a sale of the shoes. It's a final sale and thirty percent off. So I love shopping. So I stopped by to see the shoes. And then there was a good one. And I really liked it. So I bought a pair of shoes.
And then I walked around the department,and then I found fifty percent off clothing section. And then there was a very nice shirt. It's a yellow one. And then I also bought this shirt, too. . Finally, I bought a lot of things including my husband gift. I was so happy to buy my shoes and clothes and present for my husband. and then I went back home from the department.
You are welcome.
. actually, very difficult to go to shopping on weekends because there is a kid. So this year, actually I go to the university to study. So I have a little bit time to go shopping on weekdays.
So I stop by the department, and then I buy my clothes and shoes. So not so often.
Usually not so often. But this year luckily I can go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. .
 when the baby is so small, I mean baby means zero and one year, I did breast feeding for the baby so mother is very important. So it's maybe mother stay home, and take care for baby, it's a good for the baby. And then I feel it's good. I mean and free time is limited, it's no problem because baby need mothers. But three, four, five years, if my husband more helps me, I'm very comfortable to live everyday, I think. But my husband also is a teacher. And then weekends he has a club activity's coach. So he has also no free time. And then I'm so tight schedule. So both are very limited free time.
Because the kids are young. . So I think cooperation is very important, .
Yeah. Depend on the age .

Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. He knows. But , yeah.
Yeah. Actually, he is a math teacher. So didn't.
