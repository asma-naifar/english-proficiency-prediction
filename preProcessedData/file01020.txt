. Now?
O K. it seems like classroom. Probably, high school, I think. There are six students and one teacher. she is teaching, I guess, mathematics. And the student looks some students are listening what the teacher say. But there are some student who don't listen what the teacher says. And one student is drinking and one student chewing the gum. And also two girls are talking each other without listening what the teacher says. And yeah, it looks like a, yeah, nasty school.
Yeah.
.
I'm a high school student?
 probably most of student are usually clever student, means they studied hard to enter university
 Japanese university is hard to enter. So everyone is keen to study. So I think my school is totally differnt from this kind of school. Yeah.
Yeah.
Teacher? . She's quite a bit young.
Younger than my teacher.
And she give up to keep silent so she just teach without the response from student.
 she just teach.
Because anyway, . no, she just have to teach.
Yeah.
She look like that.
.
.

But when I came back home and opened the package, color is slightly different from what I wanted. So honestly, could you change this product?
. shirt.
A shirt.
This blue shirt.
I thought this is light blue shirt but it's actually dark shirt.
So it's too casual for the company.
Yes.
 I tried that but I didn't notice the color is dark. Probably, it's due to the light.
. But could you do that?
.
So what about just refund?
. But .
 I usually use this shop so if you think about that could you do that?
I promise that I'll buy other shirt next time.

Yes. Please. Actually, can I talk to your boss?
 I know him.

O K.
Similar experience? For what? this situation?
. Sometime yes.
 I bought a tapes.
Of Beatles.
And after I went back home and I try to listen but the tape is very old.
So the quality of sound is terrible.
But I hadn't listen that so I went to the shop again
and I try to them to change it.
But at that time, they didn't have a stock. So they just gave me refund.
Yeah.
.
.
.
. O K. .
One day last week.
O K. one day last week, Ayako and Tomoko were planning to go driving and hiking on the mountain near the river. So there where they built the tent. And they started to prepare for the dinner. Suddenly it started raining. And it getting heavier and heavier. So they finally gave up staying there at the night. So they tried to go back home but then the storm has come. So anyway, they got on the car and tried to back home but the it was so heavy storm that they couldn't go home directly. But on the way back to home, luckily, they found a hotel called "Cosmo". So they changed the plan and they have decided to stay there for one night. So finally, and they took a rest at the room of the hotel.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
Best memory?
 I became friends with some people from of course England also Greece, and Ireland,
 and probably you will be surprised from Rwanda.
Yeah.
Yeah. So yeah. I think it is the best memory that I became friend with them.
Yeah.
Yes.
 because usually, they are different from Japanese anyway.
And I became to know there are a lot of difference. But the more of it I know them, the more I became to understand them. Of course they are different, but there are lot of similarities.
Yeah. .
Like? For example yeah. For example, English. Of course English looks very different from Japanese. But I think their nature or their characteristic is very similar to Japanese. They are very polite and discrete
like Japanese.
Yeah.
When I noticed that, I was very glad. Actually my host mother
is very kind and polite.
. yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. I definitely.
.
Thank you.
.
. I hate to but I have to. 
 . My office is just one block away from here.
Yeah.
. 
Yes.
Thank you.
