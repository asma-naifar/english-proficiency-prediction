My name is .
 meet you.
Fine, thank you. And you?
 After school, I was playing basketball for three years.
But I quit playing basketball because of studying.
And now, I'm going to gym for exercising.
 I often  just run and  in the summer, I swim
in the pool. That's it for all.
 I wanted to play sports. I hate studying.
 so I don't know, but I just wanted to
exercise.
Fresh. 
Relax.
. I have one  younger brother 
father and mother. My younger brother is now  in  elementary school.
Fifth grade?
And my father is writing  newspaper.
And   because of his job,   me and my family  has to move Japan and America back and forth.
. Yeah.
Yeah.
 times.
  in America.
 it's a nice place. Lots of green,
nature.
 But it's kind of boring for me.
.
  since the each house is big,
we have to move with the car.
Not  bicycle. So
it's so far away. You can't go by alone to someone else's house.
So you have to use parents' car.
So it's kind of boring for me.
.
 like to    listen to music.
And yeah, I usually  walk listening to music and walk for an hour.
Yeah.
I don't like to ride bicycle.
Since   I mean, I don't want to stay sitting in the room.
I want to see something new.
And I want to move myself all around.
.
O K.    this is the school.
And the teachers teaching math to students. And some people are listening to music, I mean not paying attention, and talking to each other.  I don't think they're studying.
 .
  ,  I mean in the U S,  it's not only American people  learning in school.
Like Chinese and Italy.
But in Japan, almost all of them are  Japanese.
So maybe in the U S, it's more interesting, learning many things.
 .
In U S.
Studying in U S is much more better, I think.
Since I'm Japanese, I only have Japanese   mind? Yeah, mind.
But if you talk to other people like American, you can get some more ideas different than Japanese.
So it might be fun learning many things.
.

O K.
 I have this ticket but  I was being late so    can I get the money back for this ticket?
  .
 but  since   the car traffic was jam so I can't help it. . 

.        never mind.

.   the train I just came here was in an accident.
  I couldn't help it because it was the train's problem. .
 I don't know either, but   someone</SC>   it was late it was already  late.
So  yeah, it stopped at  the  station before here, 
and it stayed there for like twenty minutes. .
Yeah.
Yes.
. I want money back for that ticket.
O K.
.
Strange.
.
Strangest.
  when I was going back to my house,
 see, there's like the time schedule,
but the time was already passed. But  the train didn't go for like ten minutes
or so. And
we just stayed there for ten minutes. That's about it.
 it's better than other country but it's still crowded and
I don't like it.
O K. One day last week,   I mean one family planned to go to picnic.
And they stuff their foods and drinks and sleeping bags into their car. And they went to the park besides the river. And   star I mean, it was a storm.
 so they decided not to have the picnic in the tent. So they packed the stuff into their car again. And they  rided for few minutes. And they saw a hotel. So they decided to  sleep over  for one day in that hotel. And the next day, the weather was fine.
The end.
In summer, yes. Summer camp in U S.
Not like this, but  yeah, like riding horse.
How?
.
. Maybe you can watch T V
for more weather forecast.
Or news. So  yeah,  they must  see more weather forecast.
.
.  You mean why?

 because the kids like our age don't know how to live in     I mean the nature.
So  yeah, they must learn how the nature works and how they can survive.
But if you live in like city right here, you don't know how to survive. So
the parents  want their kids to learn how to live.
.
Yeah, many things. Like how to make foods, for example.
  how to swim  when your boat sink.
And how to rescue people
from  dangerous place.
Yeah.
That was very interesting.
Yeah.
.
 I don't have any plans
 now.
.
.
 not today.
 tomorrow.
Yeah.
