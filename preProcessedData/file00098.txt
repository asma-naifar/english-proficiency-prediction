Yes.
And I'm twin, so my twin sister go to now. And she works part-time job very hard.

 I think is much bigger than .
 because her name is . She go to campus, and it is very small, I think.
But, 's campus are gathered one place, so there are many kind of people here.
.
 I like there are many nature around me like many trees and greens. And, we have also big place. I always see people practicing , so there're many places, I think.

 I work part-time job or sleep at home, or talk with my mother or my sister.
Because I'm in chorus club and I have to for pay for stay in summer vacation for practicing, or pay for stage on December.
. And I need a money for eating with my friends, yes, so I have to earn myself.

Yes.
My father bought when I'm in freshman at junior high school. Because, our school has many computers, so my father thought we need computer for daughters. 
But actually, he can't use computer, 
 now, he ask me to teach using computer.

 the most thing I use computer sorry, is to type essay or report for the assignment. . Or, we can't send e-mail 
my home because we don't connect telephone. So when I'm in university, I send e-mail with computer.

 I think advantage is in that we can cut or paste sentences easily and easy to contact with friend especially foreign country. But disadvantage is if we use computer every day, and don't write ourselves, we can't remember sentence or words,
