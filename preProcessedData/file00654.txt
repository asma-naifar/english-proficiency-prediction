Yes. I've been ten years. And this is the second school for me.
And but the students are not so motivated. . So I have to think about the contents of the class very in order to involve the students in the classes. So, yeah, everyday is a very hard day for me. .
My classroom?
 I'm in charge of class now. . But relatively, compared to the other classes, relatively the students listen to what I'm talking to. and rather well disciplined. Some of the students are a little bit selfish. But they tend to listen to what I'm talking to in a very friendly way. . And I really like .
Yes. probably, about fifteen minutes ride on the car from school.
. In City?
 City?
 to tell the truth, I don't like City. I'd rather live in the suburb of .
'Cause on holidays. So it's not so convenient for me to live around here. But is a very traditional city. And I went to senior high school in . So, yes, there are a lot of old castles and shrines. But , I don't like this city,
so much.
.
. .
 I sometimes go to . But it's impossible for me to live around , 'cause it's very expensive and working Prefecture. So it's very inconvenient for me to live in the center of .
But just I wanna have a convenient life. 'Cause around my houses, stores and side-dish stores. I mean, I'm quite busy. So sometimes I can't prepare my supper.
So I want to buy something delicious. And there is a supermarket called Inageya. But don't attract me so much. So,
 I want to have a store selling some delicious side dish to decorate my supper.

So are one waiter is recommending one probably very expensive wine to the center couple. And they already drink? one of the men has already drunk wine. And probably he was asking the name of the wine. So the waiter is explaining what kind of wine it is. So maybe this man liked this wine. So they seems to me that they really enjoy their dinner .
in a gorgeous restaurant.
.
. I mean I'm not a strict vegetarian. But I don't eat meat. So I'm looking for some restaurants which will attracts me. But at the present moment, I haven't found such a I'd rather take some Italian food rather than the other foods. 'Cause Italian foods has various kinds of menus,
 I love Italian .
. 'Cause there is some reasons for me. healthy point of view, it's not very good for us who eat meat. And another reason is a religious reason.
'Cause if the animals were killed and when they were killed, they got lot of pains by killing. So if we eat meat, we have to also get some burden of their pain.
So which cause me some troubles in the future. So,
I believe in that religious .
So I don't want to eat meat.

 my taste becoming is changing a little bit these days. Before, I'm a so-called easy buyer.
 when I see something, I tend to buy very quickly without thinking too much. But I made a lot of mistake do by doing such kind of things.
And these days, I try to choose something very valuable and the things which I willing to wear for long time to makes me feel very comfortable, looks such kind of valuable clothes these days.

 A man is driving a car on the road. . What should I say? the opposite side there is a man who are driving motorcycle with a cellular phone and talking with one of his friends. And his friend is a girl. And he is looking at the front very carelessly, 'cause he is concentrating on using his cellular phones, the motorcyclist. So they nearly collide with each other. Just probably, a motorcyclist touched the the motorcyclist got angry, 'cause his cellular phones was broken by touching the car. But the car's driver also got angry. 'Cause the driver thought that the cause of the accident it was to be blamed for the motorcyclist 'cause the motorcyclist was using cellular phones. And a policeman the policeman was taking some notes about the accident. And the driver told the police that motorcyc the motorcyclist using a cellular phones. so the cause of the accident was up to him. And probably, the motorcyclist was looking at his bike is carried away on the trucks. So he was hopelessly looking at his motorcycles going away.
