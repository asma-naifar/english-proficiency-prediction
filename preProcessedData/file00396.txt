And, finally,              we knew the suspect  of the voice. .  The voice  is from  a cat.  The cat    looked so hungry.   so I wanted to  bring him   in my home. But he said, "No.",   because,  maybe,   he wanted to  go to  the theater and      watch the movie. .        but I made him   decided to  bring  the cat  in our house. .    he looked  so fine.      but   I have ,  to  attack him.  so    I said,  "  I brought him  in my house.".  And,  finally,  he said, "Yes".     and we stopped to  go to  a theater, and   I came back to  our house  with  the cat.
