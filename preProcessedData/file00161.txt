  I started swimming   when  I was five or four years old, so I forgot why I 
   the company    gives me  discount ticket
for us.
,     sometime we can't  get it because  the number was limited. But  usually,  I can get from  maybe personnel hands the tickets.
That's very helpful and almost free.
At home?

Yeah   soup or stew.
And  pasta.
 I don't cook Japanese food, really.
    I couldn't cook so complicated one, .
 just easy one.

O K.     I think this is a restaurant. And   three couples  eating  dinner and   they are starting their dinner, and he  is  trying to taste wine.  . Maybe he like it. And    I think this restaurant   is good and I think it's looks expensive.
  because   they are all well dressed.
And   even with piano.

yeah, last week, because of jet lag
  I'm very sleepy in the evening.
And yesterday, I entertained my customer

Super express.    what time will the super express start?
Three o'clock. O K. .
Excuse me?
One hour? .
But  the super express is the fastest, right?
O K.  O K.  can I have two tickets? .

 Is that  cheaper one?
