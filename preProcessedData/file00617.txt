Of course, it's one day .
. This season, there is a  so many sightseeing guests. . So, at fortunately, yesterday, it was not so crowded, and  it's getting red and yellow leaves in maples or oak and other trees around here.

My husband? . My husband is just a office worker. And,   no,  last April,  he has been promoted.  this means he gets very busy this year than before. So he always  comes home late. And, of course, I  wait for him. So I just  cook, and I go to my bed. So, sometimes, I can not see   his face at night. .

And  they are just beginning their dinner. And they ordered red wine at first. And, now, the guy just tried to taste. And  the lady looks his wife, and  this might be some memorial days like  marriage or birthday or Christmas or  year end. So   sommelier   asks the guest for  another glass of wine. And they might consider. And    a lady    is playing piano. So  the atmosphere is very romantic and   adulty because  no children were found.
Wedding anniversary? </OL>.

"You  ate out"? . Yeah. . I've just returned to Japan from Britain three days ago. And I didn't ask my husband to pick me up at the airport. However, he came. So it's very kind of him. And my flight arrived around  no, no,   almost nine o'clock. It was almost nine o'clock. So it's a little late. And I found him when I get down to the exit of baggage place area.  so  I could went home by  our car. And, on the way to home, I and my husband took  small dinner time.  but it was not so special restaurant because I was a little bit tired and  just a family restaurant   which name is  "Saizeria".

.
On the flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo, I just watched it.
It's not bad.   of course, it was very interesting. But I know   it getting very popular in Japan. However,   it is not so interesting.   it was less interesting than I expected.
. The Bridget Jones is a  thirty two years old lady. And the story is her daily life, and,  finally    it came happy end. So how can I say   it is a little bit  lack of reality.
"One day last week"?  "One day last week"? O K? So, May I start?
. Is this me?
So, O K? So I found   there were no food in the refrigerator. And I was really upset because Friday is my   husband's birthday. So I wanted to cook much. However, there was nothing inside refrigerator. So I immediately  went to a grocery shop by car. . And   I shopped very much everything like  meat or cereals,  vegetables and  raw fish and et cetera. And, fortunately,  at the pay place,   I can pay smoothly. I mean there is no long line as usual. So,  after payment,  I went back to my cars.  I parked car in front of the supermarket because   I thought  it didn't take long time. So  I went back to car, and all my shop groceries   rear the car.    I took them inside the car.  And I went back home. And then, I cooked so much meals. And,  at the first, I cook fried egg because fried egg is a  simple meals, and there is no problem  for   fails the cooking. And  this is one of his favorite meal. And besides  I cooked  stew. And, this time, I try to  beef stew with wine red.
That's all.
Yeah. . Basically, I am a value hunter. So, in grocery shop, I always try to buy cheaper groceries. So,  when I go to supermarkets  around seven o'clock or after,        I can find some bargain sales on every groceries  which is called "" or "" in Japanese. So,  first, I buy them. And then, I consider what to cook. . And      I always cook salad or some vegetable cookings. It's  essential because   my husband cannot take so much vegetables outside. So  it's only one point which I pay attention.
.
Yeah.
. It's very fine today. So I go back to Shibuya Station first. So I try to find  something good  bargain, and   I will take a walk around Shibuya.
Thank you.
