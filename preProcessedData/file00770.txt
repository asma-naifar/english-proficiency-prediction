Good morning.
My name is .
.
Nice to meet you.
Fine, thank you.
 I don't have any special plan. But I'm  living  by myself now so I'm going to see my father who is living in . And  my parents are from  so  actually   I lived in  until five years ago, but  now I'm living in  but  so   I going to see my parents in  and  spend   New Year  together with my  parents.
?
. As you know,  is,   you know,  that very famous for    as a  . And   now  that population is about  I think  a million, and then  city         it's very  similar to  Chiba Prefecture like a big city. And then    I think weather is a little bit colder than Tokyo because  they have a lot of snow in wintertime. Especially when I go to  every year   from the end of the year to the beginning of the year,  they  always have  snow around New Year's Day, and then   also  has   a lot of mountains, and   they don't have  much plain area so they have a lot of mountains. And  also surrounded by sea, and there're a lot of islands  in the  so   the view from my house is very good because my house is in the middle of the mountain, and then I can just see   the cities and also  islands in . And also sometimes I can see   Prefecture   when  the weather is good, and the air is very clear.
 it's very very beautiful .
. Yes.
. Yeah.  I   just be together. I mean we don't do anything special. Maybe we just go out for shrine for New Year's Day. And then we just stay home and then watch T V together, and then   we cook together. And then    also   in Hiroshima that the fish is very fresh and very  good quality so  we cook together, and then      some of relatives visit us. So we  just spend time together.

O K. . It seems to be     a mountain, and     there are  snow, and people are  skiing. And most  of them seem to be  kids, but  some of them are couples. And  I think      it seems to be  very popular ski area, and the childrens are playing with snowballs and make    I don't know how to say in English, but this one  snow doll. And also  the couples are having coffee in the ski lodge and   one of them are just  fell down  and ski. And he seems to be a beginner, and   three of them are just  taking  ski class. And  there is one instructor is teaching them. .
?
Yes.
I've never skied in , but  I've been to ski a lot. .
.
I think  the reason, I don't know. Because of    the trend and also the fashion. And the snowboarding is a very fashionable sports, and then   many  young people in oversea like Canada or  other European people,  they   do snowboarding so maybe young people like  their fashion also. And    they have speed. Snowboarding  has speed so  that's why young people like it.
. Because you know,   I don't know if you know about the hip-hop. . Hip-hop is a kind of dance, and it's very popular amongst  young people  especially in  the United States, and then also     they wear  a big jacket and a big T-shirts and very  loose  pants. And the fashion is like a almost hip-hop dancers. So and then   compare to  ski  wear, the snowboard  wear is more like a loose, and  that's why the young people      like  the fashion.

I'm sorry,  I unfortunately I have to say that I can't attend the party tonight   because     a friend of mine  called me this morning, and she was in London this morning. And she said that she was going to take a plane to Japan,   and then  she said that she will be in Japan for a few days on business, and then  she said that    she ask me if she could meet me  tonight when she    get  in Japan. And then  tonight is the only  day she is available. And then  I'd like to meet her because   she comes to Japan     just every three year, and then  we don't have time to meet each other so often so tonight is the only night that we can meet. And then   we haven't each other for almost five years. .
O K. . Maybe I would ask her when she gets  Narita Airport, and if she is not tired,  maybe I'll bring her to the party.
  I'm sorry, would you just that tell them that  I'm  sick because  maybe  they don't feel very good,  if        if I  don't attend the party  because of    my friend, and I don't know if    they don't know how important  my friend is to me so maybe if you can say  I'm very very sick.
.
Bye.
Yes, .
. Holding a party? .  First of all, to be invited to the party is like   just I'm very  inquisitive person, and I'm very curious about    you know, the people and the inside of the house so usually they have  party inside of the house, and especially  if it is the first time for me to visit their house, I'm very   interested in their  furnitures and other, you know, that's  of their house and rooms so   it's very  fun to   watch the inside of the interior and also   I can meet a lot of  new people in the party.

So  last week, I was  walking down the street with my friend, and my friend heard that    something is    crying. And then   we thought that this is a cat crying, and then we just  a cat    by the street. And then  we wondered if we could take this  cat to home because  the cat      is  just left by somebody, so  but my friend said maybe we couldn't, but I really wanted to take a cat to home because it's very cute, and it's a very cold day so  we decided to take this cat to home.
,   I don't know if I can say pets, but I have small  tropical fish  in my home.
In . .
.   because like me,  I'm living  by myself, and then   even the   fish doesn't speak, but  whenever I come home, and then I just feel very tired or very  maybe depressed    by seeing the fish, maybe  I just  feel a little bit better by seeing   the animals or fish so   they make me a little bit happier.
I have a class after this  interview, and that class is   seminar of  global  environment. And we just do the panel discussion.
