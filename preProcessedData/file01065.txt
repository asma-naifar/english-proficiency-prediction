. When I start to join this company, I worked at sales department. And my golf friend almost sales person because sales person usually play the golf with their customer. So I went to golf with customer only one time.
It's little bit hard .
. When I lived in , I start to play golf because my ex-husband likes to play golf very much. But at first, I don't like the golf, because I don't like sports very much, not very much. I hate sports because I got the lowest grade when I was junior high school student for physical training class. But my arms are long and I'm tall, so my friend said it's to play golf my physical. So I try to practice and practice.

And two boys played with ball. And man is running on the road. a little cat sleep on a car roof in front of the big house. And beside the car, two housewife talking. And a opposite side of the bigger house, there is a bench. And the man sitting on the bench and reading newspapers.

. I had lived in for three years because my ex-husband transferred the branch in his company after we got married. In , at first, I took the E S L class at the university for six months to take another course of the university. I wanted to take the accompaniment course because I play the piano. after finished E S L course, I couldn't join the accompaniment course because of my poor English. So I started to go to learn the piano for Italian teacher, but his husband was Japanese. So she speaks little bit Japanese.
