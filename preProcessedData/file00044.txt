My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<F>Er</F> <F>hm</F> in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Yes.Yeah. We moved there <F>er</F> about one month ago.Yeah. It's comfortable.<F>Mhmm</F>. Not I, <F>er</F> but my mother choose the place because <F>er</F> she likes the atmosphere. <F>Hm</F>. There's no big stores but <F>er</F> only houses and it's so quiet <R>and</R> and the people around is nice.My major is <R>English</R> English literatureand <F>er</F> linguistics.<F>Er</F> when I traveled to England, <F>er</F> I was in the high school and <F>er</F> I saw a <SC>play</SC> Shakespeare play in Stratford and <F>er</F> I was so impressed.<SC>I</SC> and then I became <R>interested</R> interested in <F>hm</F> English literature like Shakespeareand plays.<F>Er</F> <R>when I</R> when I first saw the play, <R>I</R> I was just <F>er</F> <.></.> thought it was great because <F>er</F> <SC>I just</SC> I think <F>er</F> then I just like the play atmosphere.<R>Then</R> <F>mhmm</F> then I liked the actors speaking, <F>er</F> <R>I thought</R> I thought that <F>er</F> the words are so beautiful.<R>It</R> <R>it</R> it was different from <R>what</R> what I learned in the school.English was different. And I thought it's so beautiful <SC>so</SC> <R>and</R> and I became interested.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Urr</F> <F>mhmm</F> I think both Japanese people and <F>er</F> <F>er</F> British people are so quiet, <F>er</F> not so bright<F>er</F> as American people. <SC>And</SC> <?>right</?>, and not so friendly. But <F>mhmm</F> I think <R>they</R> <F>mhmm</F> <R>they think</R> <F>er</F> they think more and deeply.When I talk to British people <?>closely</?>, <F>er</F> I can understand what they think. <F>Er</F> I feel <R>they</R> <F>er</F> they have <R>same</R> same spirit as Japanese. I think because <SC>they</SC> <F>er</F> that British is like islandas Japan.Free time? I like traveling,watching movies. I like listening to music.Sometimes <R>I</R> I play tennis.<??></??>O K.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Start?O K. This is <SC>the</SC> a map and the train station.<F>Er</F> I think <SC>the</SC> this is <SC>the</SC> <F>mhmm</F> some kind of big citybecause there're many train rails. <F>Mhmm</F> and <.></.> there are two rivers,<SC>so I think it's</SC> <R>an</R> and there is a zoo, <R>so</R> so I think it's a beautiful <?>like</?> leisure city.I think <SC>it's</SC> this city is so comfortable to live,because <F>er</F> I think the rivers are beautiful and <F>mhmm</F> there are many <R>trains</R> trains are running. And <F>er</F> also there are schools, libraries, hospitals. <F>Hm</F>. <R>We</R> we need such kind of things<F>er</F> around my houses.<R>And</R> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>mhmm</F> and we can see <F>er</F> <SC>bus stops</SC> so many bus stops.So I think <F>er</F> it is a kind of <F>mhmm</F> new town<R>made</R> made for the peoplelive comfortably.Ideal town? <F>Mhmm</F>. O K. I think I need a train station as well as this map because <SC>I need</SC> <F>er</F> if there is a train station, we can go anywhere. <F>Mhmm</F> and also we need hospitals, schools, and supermarkets, <SC>and the</SC> <F>er</F> or other convenience <F>er</F> <SC>shops</SC> <F>er</F> stores. And <F>hm</F> it's better <F>er</F> to have <F>er</F> big parks or rivers like this. <F>Mhmm</F>. <CO>And</CO>. <F>Mhmm</F> <..></..> <F>er</F>. <F>Well</F>. <F>Er</F>.<F>Umm</F> because now, I have a big river near my house and sometimes <SC>I <SC>walk a</SC> walk</SC> I go for walk, and it's so comfortable. I like the river.And there's so many birds there, and <..></..> such kind of <F>er</F> rivers or lakes make people comfortable.O K.No.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.O K.<F>Er</F> excuse me. <F>Er</F> I couldn't take the train that I reserved.

When I was going to Ireland from England,<F>er</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I took ferry<R>to</R> to Ireland. <SC>And I</SC> <F>er</F> and <F>er</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> I had a big bag, and I need <R>to</R> to get to other room.Then <F>er</F> when I <SC>get</SC> got to Ireland, I was waiting for the bagcoming. But <F>er</F> the <SC>bag was</SC> bag didn't came and it was lost.And, yeah, so we need to wait so long because it was in <JP>Belgii</JP>.<SC>And</SC> <F>er</F> but <F>er</F> people in a office of the ship gave me the ticket for eating and <F>eh</F> hotels, so I wait about <R>one</R> one day<OL>for the bag</OL>.Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh-huh</F>.O K.O K.Start?<F>Hm</F>. One day last week, <F>er</F> <SC>the man</SC> the businessman went to the station and <SC>sh</SC> he was <F>er</F> about to ride a train.And <R>when</R> <F>eh</F> when he was waiting the train at the platform, <F>er</F> <R>some</R> some <R>other</R> other man's elbow hit him and <SC>the bag</SC> <SC>his</SC> the businessman's bag dropped into the train rail.And <F>eh</F> <F>urr</F> the business man <SC>get an</SC> got angry <SC>and</SC> <F>mhmm</F> <R>because the</R> because the bag dropped into to the <F>er</F> train rail because of the other man's elbow.<F>Er</F> <F>hm</F> but <F>er</F> <F>mhmm</F> <SC>the people</SC> that person in the station, <F>urrmm</F> <.></.> put the bag <R>to the</R> to the businessman <?>back</?>. <SC>And then</SC> since then, <F>erm</F> the businessman kept <SC>the</SC> his bag <F>erm</F> so carefully. <??></??> and <R>in</R> <R>in the</R> in the train, he never <F>er</F> put the bag, <F>er</F> <SC>far from he</SC> <R>fa</R> far from him<F>er</F> <R>not</R> not to <F>mhmm</F> drop or kicked or lost anymore.Yes. O K. <F>Er</F> transportation. I think <F>mhmm</F> <R>trans</R> transportation in London and Tokyo is <F>er</F> not so different. <F>Er</F> there are so <R>many</R> many subway lines, <F>mhm</F> and we can go anywhere by the subway. But <SC>the</SC> in rest of the country, <F>er</F> in Japan, we can go <SC>everywhe</SC> almost everywhere by train <SC>but</SC> <R>and</R> <F>er</F> <F>hm</F> and <SC>the train is so correct</SC> the <SC>ti</SC> train time table is correct. But <F>er</F> <SC>in the British</SC> in Britain, <F>er</F> <SC>we</SC> there are not so many train lines. We can't go <F>hm</F> somewhere. We need cars, some other transportations.And the time table is not correct and <F>eh</F> <F>er</F> sometimes the trains will be late or the train stopped.And so I think the <SC>transportation in</SC> yes, Japanese one is better than British one.<F>Urmm</F> I need to go to buy a pair of suitfor job hunting.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Mhmm</F> I think grey one.Yeah.<F>Mhmm</F> in the beginning.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Yeah.<OL>O K</OL>.<OL>Thank you</OL>. <OL>Thank you</OL>.
