.
Nice to meet you, too.
. Thank you.
 today I'm very fine.
.
No. I live in Prefecture. but I'm a Phd student of archeology in University .
So I come to every day.
 I have been working in Egypt for about ten years.

Egypt?
 Egypt is very hot in summer season. I guess it is around fifty centigrade around noon.
 but I have already used to the temperature. you know, Japan is very hot in summer. but in Egypt, it is rather dry and not so humid. So it would be more comfortable than that in Japan.

 you know, in Egypt Friday is holiday in a week.
So Friday is our free time. So we can go everywhere around Cairo, the capital of Egypt. sorry, we are staying in Cairo during the excavation.
 on Friday, we often go to other points of sightseeing.
And in addition, we often enjoy spending time in some European hotels in Cairo to dine in cafeteria. 
Yes.
Favorite restaurant?
 as I'm student so I seldom go to so called restaurant. I always go to rather small restaurant or university cafeteria.
.
Colleague or good friend? So may I talk about my wife?
 I got married two years ago.
And my wife is also a Phd student of archaeology. And she is also archeology major.
And yes, really good colleague.
And she is also my rival
 in the field of archaeology.
Yes.
.
About the picture? there is a house. two children is playing with ball. And one girl with sorry, rope.
And further more, one man is running on the street. there is a car in front of the house. And on the car, a cat is sleeping. And two women are talking on the street. And one old man is reading newspaper on the bench 
. .
In Egypt?
.
Houses. Cairo is the capital city of Egypt. So Cairo is very big city and there are many modern buildings like Tokyo.
 but in rural village, where we are working, there are many small house made of mud brick and sometimes made of stone.
And mud brick house not looks not so strong.
And you know, in Egypt, it rains sometimes. And the mud brick house often collapse by rain.
 I have ever visited several mud brick house, and it looks really comfortable. Because inside the house, it is not so hot. And it's actually really cool.
So I think it's very comfortable for us
and for Egyptian people.
 Yes.
. O K.
.
 yes. I would like to ask you something.
 I bought this shirts.
 but I tried this shirt at home, but I'm sorry, I don't like it. So I wonder if you could possibly replace this shirt.
 . 
 it's little bit small for me. so it's not so comfortable for me. could you possibly replace it with larger one?
Yes.
 yes, actually I try it. I don't it doesn't fit me.
So please 

it?
Yes, please.
Yes. I will talk with the manager.
She is out?
So when is she back?
You don't know?
So, O K, I'll be back here after one hour. So I can try to ask her.
?
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
.
 when I buy a shirts in Japan, it's not usual to put on the shirts so I just see the label
and I can decide the size depend on the .
But both M and L is good for me.
 so every time I'm not sure which is better for me.

So do I have to describe this pictures?
Simple story?
 yes.
 one day last week, I went to a restaurant my my professor. And he he guided me into the restaurant. he told me that " you could choose everything you like.". so I was very pleased to choose everything I wanted to eat. And I drunk a glass of beer and he drunk a glass of wine. and we took some plates of fish and chicken. very satisfi we were very satisfied with the meals. he paid all for me. I to him.
.
 yes, sometimes.
Yes.
 And every time he took me to the restaurant, he paid all.
.
 once or twice per month.
 Yes.
 yes I'm awfully sorry that my wife left Japan today.
 she German university.
Yes. for the period of two years.
. And I'm also leaving Japan after two weeks to the Netherlands
to study archaeology
 the period of the same years.
Yes. Actually very close. but she will be in Berlin and I'm in a city near Amsterdam. And you know, the distance between Amsterdam and Berlin is very far.
 that it would take ten hours by bus and seven hours by train.

Thank you very much.
