.
Yes. My name is .
.
Yes, please.
I live in ,
 Prefecture.
The area?
   is located about fifty kilometers  Tokyo. And it's a kind of resort  town. So there are lot of people  come  visit  for sightseeing, or  in during  summer,  there are lot of people  come  swimming in sea.
Place?
. It's  historical  old town so there are a lots of temples and shrines. There're approximately one hundred fifty  temples and shrines in all. So  it's a good place to  walk around.
. Yes. Now at this moment, I live alone.
But  in my school days, I lived there. And   at that time, about two years, but  I    live there  about   thirty  years  since I got married.
Job?
.  my job. . Yes. . When I graduated from   college, I worked for , a chemical company as a secretary for three years. But after that. I got married, and I wanted to  have a teaching job. But it's very difficult to  have a   regular  teaching  job. So  I usually  stayed at home  within my children. But , I have a time and chance, I will worked for  high school, junior and senior, as a part-time teacher.
To teach?
. You know, teaching is learning.
So      it's very  happy to be with  young students. And  at the same time, I can learn a lot. When  I stay home,  there's  nothing to   express myself, or talk about. . So I'd like to have a teaching job.
Yes.  .  this picture shows the  a  kind of party in a hotel or restaurant. . And there are three couples  enjoying their dinner. And this hotel is a western style hotel so  they sit   together  at table, and  wines and  western food are served.  And maybe those couples are  young or  some of them are middle age. . And in a hotel,  it's  very    I think because  there's a piano  sounds.  . And  there's a very  old black tall clock. So  I think this restaurant or  hotel  is  maybe  old and traditional hotel.
.
 I like Japanese food.
. But sometimes I eat a western or Chinese food also.  but I usually eat Japanese  because  western food  is something different from Japanese, and I think   it contains a lot of  . So it's not good for health.
.
Japanese ?
. . There are lots of  Japanese restaurant.  but  I usually go to a small  restaurant. And   I sometimes   visit  Japanese  sushi bar. . But is it called Japanese restaurant? 
It's a little different.   we sit    bar. So   maybe it's not a Japanese restaurant. Is it called Japanese?
 sure. .
. But around the Kokubunji area,  there's some  Japanese restaurant where we can  sit on  or around the . . And I like the atmosphere very much. .
. O K, Just moment, please.
Yes.   I'd like to  get on this  train,    I was  late for the train, but    is this ticket available  for change  to the different one?
No?  I'm sorry to hear that.  . But sometimes     the officers change and  the other one  when   I  usually  late for the     the express. But  is it not available here?
   I got up late  this morning. So  I couldn't   get on  the train  near my house. And it takes about  one hour. So I had better  get up earlier. I'm very sorry. . O K.  I'll buy  another one.
Yes.
It's my fault.
O K.
All right.
.
.
. But recently  I went to  Kochi  and Hiroshima and Okayama, too. So  in that case, I like to  take  shinkansen  instead of  plane. I don't like airplane. 
Why?  I don't like the time   when I ride the airplane. And especially at the   taking off,   some airplane   give the passengers  what can I say,  the feeling.  I don't like the feeling when I feel something  ache  in my .
I don't like that.
.
One day last week.  and all in one day?
One day last week, I found  that my refrigerator is empty. And I have to prepare  for the dinner. . So I went out  for shopping  to the supermarket  by car. And in supermarket, I bought  bread and meat  and some other vegetables and drinks. And paid at the  register. And I  put everything  in back of my car. And I started preparing  for dinner. It was a hard day because  I have a job.  but ?
Is that O K?
?
 I don't like to go to supermarket.
I usually go to a  green grocery.   and  sometimes I ask the  shop    to bring the goods to my house. It's   special shop  collecting  vegetables, meats and everything from the  producer
 
 from everywhere.
But sometimes I go to  the supermarket whenever I can not find    small things.
.
O K.
This afternoon?
 . This afternoon, I'm going to have a    class. . And at the same time, I have a  course  in a  English  school. So I   which  shall I take.  Maybe I go to   language school because I'd like to  pass the examination   next February. So I have to prepare   for the examination.
