My name is .
Yes.
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?
Yes.
I ate .
 in my home.
Yeah.
I cook myself.
No. I live with my family.
But   during     afternoon,  there are no people in my home. So I have to cook lunch
by myself.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.   I'm in the   club so   a freshman of  club have to wear uniform  for  one hour.   but  when there is no practice, I don't have to wear uniform. But today I have practice. So I wear uniform.
Yeah.
     I join  club   during high school and high school, and I was  student  ,  this school. And   I sometimes  go to   practice  because university is near my high school.  so   I know  how the  university's  club is and I think  it will be  good for me to join  club.
So   I decided to join  club in university.
Yes.       freshman have to do a lot of things. I have to clean   and open windows and wash  head coach's    
and so on.
 there are   many  jobs.  so  during  freshman, I have to do a lot of things. But   comparing  other universities,  it's     less than university  because    my  also do  a lot of things.  so  I think    there is   not so strict  relation. I think  we are  very friendly.
O K.
Yes. . Yes. .  describe. O K.       a girl is   sitting  the chair. And in front of her, there  a personal computer. And     next to the   P C, there are printer.   but  now he is looking at a  cat     which is  lying in her bed. And  there is also a dog. It is in the floor.   and  there is   the big   stereo systems   on the rack. And I think  it's very expensive. .
No.
Yes.  because  my family don't like pets.
Yes.
   because  they are busy. So   they don't have enough time to keep pets,
I think.
O K.
Yes. Hello.   tomorrow is Sunday. Are you free  on tomorrow?
 so  now  very interesting movie is    showing    in theater. So   I want to go to see the movie with you.
 how about you?
Movie? What movie? Yes.  the movie is  " Harry Potter".
Yes.
Yes. Yes.  so my house is   Ogikubo and   I can go to Shinjuku   only in twenty minutes. So how about going Shinjuku?
.
. O K. So  tomorrow I want to  sleep  a lot of time so
    so how about going   from  afternoon?
  so       let's wait  in front of ALTA   at one thirty
in the afternoon.
O K?
So    the movie is   begin at two fifteen. So   we have to wait for some time. But  there will be a long line.
.
 No.
.    O K, so  I'm going to  buy ticket  now.
O K.
Thank you. So see you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.
Yes.    honestly speaking, I'm not interested in this. 
       I'm    in Japanese, so I don't want to do as  everyone .
Yes.  recently   I see  Sylvester Stallone's movie.   I saw     from Rocky one to Rocky five. .
And   it was   very very nice movie,
I think.
Yes,      sorry  first, Rocky    is a boxer but he is not  famous. But   the champion  Apollo      chose Rocky for a challenger. And then  he fought  Apollo   but he lost. But he did a very very     nice match.  he didn't  knocked out.   then he  became very famous.
Yes.     one day,        I have stolen foods by someone. So    I have to buy foods. So   I went to supermarket by car. And in supermarket,     there  bargain sale was held so I bought a lot of foods. And    some of them are not inaccessible for me. But  they are very very cheap so  I bought them. Then   I went to  the register and    then  the price      were expensive than I expected. So   I return some of them.
Then after 
   I brought my foods to my car and I went to home.  and  the night on the day, I cooked food.   they are  very delicious so I was very glad. But tomorrow, I have to  go to police.
.
Compare? Yes.        in supermarket  the price is cheaper than convenience store.    so I think       I  went to  supermarket  when the supermarket is open. But  at midnight or early in the morning,  supermarket is  closed but  convenience store is  open     every time. So convenience store is    so convenient  for me.   because at midnight,     when I want to eat something,  there is nothing to eat in refrigerator in my home,    I go to convenient store and  buy some foods and          I became glad for that.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow, I have two classes.
Yes. So I will go to university and I also have  practice of club.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
