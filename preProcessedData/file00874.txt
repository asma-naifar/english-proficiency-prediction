Sure.   my name is .
Yes.
Yes, please.
Nice to meet you.
Fine, a bit tired, though.
.
 . You know, around kind of this time in  late afternoon, I feel a bit tired because I can't have  enough sleep at night so.
. I have  little kids, and,  you know,  especially the little one wakes me up  twice or three times a night. .
.
Yes. . My first son is   who's six years old, and who goes to nursery school every day from seven o'clock in the morning until seven o'clock in the afternoon.
 And the little is  one year and four months. And she is a kind of  .
. So she can't sleep for a long time, so  I can't sleep for a long time.
 How do I enjoy?
What do you mean ?
I see. . Having children is  fun for me because     .  .   you know, they give me energies.  . At the same time, they suck my energies. 
Yeah. Looking at their smiling or playing is  my   pleasure. . I enjoy .
.  If I have my own free time  without any children,  I'd like to     have a drink with my friends, or sometimes I'd like to read some books. Yeah. That kind of things.
.
. It's a difficult question. . I bought    several paperbacks. . It's very easy ones.  that's "Harry Potter" in English, or, yeah, other some newly released  essays. So, if I have time, I'd like to have them. .
He wants to help me, but he can't because  he's away from Japan now. Yeah. So I'm alone with the two children. Sometimes, my mom comes and  look after, or  cook our suppers, and  do some washing, and so on.

Yes.
 Describe?
. .  It's a sunny days. There is  a kind of    middle class   house here. And there are three kids playing in the  front garden.  A man is running, and he's . And  two ladies are chatting on the road. One of the  lady has a dog,  and a cat is having a nap on a roof of a car. Is that enough?
 . If I may say, it's a little bit alike   suburb in England, yes.  . I lived in , which is a  suburb of London. Yes. And      almost the houses have this kind of,  you know, grass garden. Yeah.   kind of thing.
One of the memory?
 Yes. .    sorry, the house where I lived is    the middle sized house, which has four bedrooms. And  it's very old one, but,  I mean, the British guys says it's not ,  big. And  I has a middle size garden. . For me, it was huge size garden. And we saw squirrels and some magpies or  even foxes come into the garden. Yeah. And my son enjoyed playing in the garden. . He really loved slides or swings. Yeah. But  it was a bit too big for me to clean up. 
Yeah.
I can guess.
.
O K.  .
Right. Hello?
. This is . ? .
 . Sorry, I can't   come to your party  because  my son's got  high temperature now. I try to catch you before. But,  sorry, I was at the hospital, and I couldn't.   . We apologize  this very   late cancellation. . Isn't it any problem with that?
I see.  . I try to get there, but   I can't because  my son is very   miserable now. So,  if  you could have another parties,  would you mind let me know because   I really want to meet you and all of my friends or your friends there.
 dear. So . If you could   make it frozen and send it to me. . It may be better. . .
Right. I'm really sorry about that. But,   if you could understand my situation,  yeah.  Sorry about that.
Thank you. .
 . Yes. It's not a big one, but  I was invited to my son's family for dinner. But  at that afternoon, actually my son had the temperature around forty degrees centigrade. Then,  we couldn't go there  even though      they're ready for us to have a dinner there. Yeah.
Yes. .   we call them   one or two weeks after  to offer them some  Japanese food.
One last week.

O K. Two girls are planning to have a camp.    they were happy to packing in  everything for the camp.  Then,   it was very beautiful place  where they can see  mountains. And,    by the pond, I'm not sure, by the lake or pond, they  set up their tent. But, just after the tent's ready,   it started raining. And even the wind blows  heavily.  The wind blew out the  tents. So the two girls   jumped into the car.    on the way back to the home,    they found the hotel. And they pop into  there.  Then, they can have  a rest here with a cup of tea. But   the goods which  they had prepared   didn't have them .  .
With my family? . Now, I don't have . So  I enjoyed some playing in the park. Or, last month, I went to skiing with them. . . . Activity, you said?
Yeah.  Activity. Let me see. . We  enjoy riding the bike.  What else? . And, sometimes we visit    my son's friend's home.
. I haven't tried to do that because  actually I can't go to the park every day because I'm working. And, for example,  on weekends, I would rather spend  ourselves  rather than, you know, to be disturbed by others. And,   sometimes my son's friends call us to  be there. So  I don't feel alone at all. . Sorry,    I can't answer your .
. O K.
 . I'm going to a cafe to check something for my project because my project is related to a cafe. So it's good, you know, chance to visit around Shibuya's cafe.
