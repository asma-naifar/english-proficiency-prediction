to be enough.
 weekend lunch. 
 I'm prefer to drink a tea or coffee,
 because I have low tolerance with alcoholic
so I'm looking for a lot 
 coffee shop or tea shop.
So in my lunch on weekends, I usually go to 
 
shops to have a lot of teas, 
eating
 lunch.
 yes. this is in . 
 .
 this is located near downtown, 
 
there aren't many people 
 in the coffee shop
because the coffee shop is not main street, 
 is .
And the reason why I 
to that 
is to be able to be relaxed 
when I go to there.
. .
 weekday. my assignment 
is a lot of .
so I have to work 
 most all my time. .
 in fact, my assignment

parts manufacturers.

There are lot of furniture instruments in this room.
 in the background, 
 there is a drawer and next to the drawer, there is a 
 shelf and stereo equipment.

 which is cat on the 
bed.

 he or she might be sleeping .
And in the right-hand side, there is a desk. there are lot of instrument on this desk. for example, computer, ,
 . 
And the woman is sitting on the 
at the desk. she is smiling and she is

pets.

 no, in my office, I use note-type 
computer. I think compared with desktop 
 , note-type 
 very convenient for 
use it becaue
 note-type isn't big space 
to use. .

can I can bring it .

good point.
 desk-type computer can upgrade by 
easily.
