So I'm so sorry, but I can not do anything about this.Yeah. But I was very <F>um</F> confused. Yeah. <SC>So</SC> and I was so busy because everyone <SC>call me</SC> called me. <SC>And I have to call</SC> so I have to call many people. Yeah. And <R>I</R> I didn't know about <F>ur</F> the situation how she got <F>ur</F> a accident. So <R>I</R> I have to go to police yesterday. Yeah.Yeah.<F>Uhh</F> thank you.Next time, I'll go.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Refuse something?<F>Mmm</F> <.></.> yes.<F>Urr</F> <F>mm</F> <R>my</R> my friends <F>urr</F> <SC>call</SC> called me, and went out dinner or drinking. But sometimes I don't feel like going out. So I wanted to see my friends. But <SC>my feeling is not so</SC> if my feeling is not so good, sometimes I say <F>mm</F> I have to do my homework <nvs>laughter</nvs> or something. Sometimes I use, but it's not good. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes, yes. Totally. <OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.<F>Mm</F> yes. Because we keep in touch with my e-mail or the mobile phone. Yeah. But I don't like mobile phone so much because we can not see the face. <R>So</R> <F>mm</F> so I need to go <laughter>out more often, I think</laughter>.O K. <F>Uh</F> could I see the picture before?<F>Mhm</F>. O K. One day last week, I drove my car on the street. And there's other guy who ride a <R>motor</R> motorcycle. And I suppose he was talking with his friends or <R>some</R> someone. And he didn't look at me. And then <F>uhm</F> I wanted to <SC>turn right</SC> <F>uh</F> turn left, but <F>mhm</F> <SC>his drive</SC> the way of his driving is like not straight. He didn't go straight so <SC>I was</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>I</R> I think <SC>I was</SC> <F>uh</F> <SC>it</SC> I cared about him, <SC>but I couldn't</SC> <F>urr</F> but we attacked <R>each other</R> each other. And then his mobile phone was broken. And he told me I need to fix it, and <SC>pay</SC> I have to pay some money for this mobile phone. And then <F>mhm</F> I couldn't understand it. So I call the policeman, and <F>uum</F> I explained him about the situation <SC>why we attacked</SC> why we got a accident. And then the <R>po</R> <F>urm</F> police man called some car company to take his motorcycle.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Yeah.Women?Especially?<F>Mhm</F>. Because <SC>they're very lonely</SC> they feel lonely, I think. <F>Mm</F> especially in <H pn="others1">XXX04</H> area, there're a lot of people living here, but <F>mm</F> each person's feeling is not satisfied about our lives. <SC>So</SC> and each of them have some feelings <SC>because</SC> <F>uh</F> some feelings that <F>ur</F> <SC>they are alone</SC> they are living alone. So <SC>the mo</SC> and mobile phone is so useful <SC>about <R>con</R> contact</SC> on contacting with others.<CO>So <OL>I think</OL></CO>.<SC>Two</SC> three weeks ago.<F>Urr</F> everyone says so. Because my friend told me, "Why do you go to Tibet?". <SC>And</SC> but <SC>I was study</SC> <F>ur</F> I studied about Tibet because my major was ethnic study. So I was very interested.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Thank you very much.
