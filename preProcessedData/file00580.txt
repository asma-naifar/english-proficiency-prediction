My name is .
I'm Fine. I'm .
 yourself?
O K. .
?
. Actually, I was visiting Hong Kong.
And then yesterday, I'm going back to Japan.
.
In Honk Kong?  I visited some customers.
 the main purpose was  to bring the demo sample to show  in front of the customer.
Hong Kong,
 hot
. Then, there's a lot of humidity
comparing with Japan
 .
 but  there was a lot of people 
walking
and  a lot of cars
and also a lot of buildings.
 not so beautiful.
But  I feel some kind of energy.
.
Job?
.  basically, I am selling some kind of devices
to the Hong Kong,
and Singapore,
and also United States.
And then, those products
is  .
 So,    we are introducing Japanese technology to the Asian people, 
sometimes, United States .
 
 go to the business .
  
best .
Or  I can have  those kind of opportunity,
so  that's very good for me.
 I can see many thing.
I can meet a lot  very good staff.
.
.
No,  I was in   community college
   near our  subsidiary.
We have a branch office in .
And then,  the college was nearby  our office.
And then,  I was taking 
business classes 
marketing or advertising, .

    the first I visited United States,
 mean, two years ago,
I was so impressed because
I feel like 
everything was different 
Japan.
But after two years, I feel almost same as Japan.
Everything is all the same.
, people are .
.
So,   I think   no big difference
between United States and Japan.
.
.
How to describe it?
. This picture shows somebody's studying room.

And    actually,    I don't know, but she likes dog and cat.
So, that's the why she has 
and also cat in her room. And    maybe  she's not a student.
She's a editor. 
she has a typewriter 
personal computer.
Then  her favorite  song is  classical music.
  looks like expensive audio set.
.

 my?
.  I like Japanese pops.
But since I was in United States,
so I don't know the
current
 pops.
Classical music? When I was child,
my parents  make me to listen
the classical music.
   so,    when I'm hearing the classical music, I can  be relax,
maybe. But I don't like it.
.
.
? Television also?
 really?
  I think  the children should not have mobile phone.
 'cause I think the  monthly payment
is paid by their parents.
, if the children 
their earnings,
they can have a mobile phone by themself. But  if they don't have any  earnings, 
I think, they should not, or the parents should not buy mobile phone  for the children, 
children should not have the mobile phone.
  I've never 
the T V set 
room, so I don't have any idea.
?
O K.
  O K.
 
  I got a ticket for that train. But  due to the traffic
was really bad, 
I couldn't get on that train. So, if it's possible, could you exchange the train to the next one?

 against the policy . 
 O K.
 another one.
. 
Why? 'Cause  last night, I went to the bar
 too much. So, I couldn't wake up   in the morning.
So it's my fault. .
    O K, I reached the station
  no, five minutes before.
At this time, the window person sold me the  nine-o'clock train .
But it was eight fifty-five. So I ,
"Is it possible to catch that train?".
And then he said, "Yes, you can.". So that's the why I got nine-o'clock ticket.
,
 when I went to the entrance, there was a lot of people, and then line was so .
Then,  I tried to get the train, but    the   station  so crowd. So .
? Thank you very much.
.
.
This is really tough.

Yes.
?
 station clerk. .  I think,  you know, there's a lot of 
 guide
in the station.
I think because of that audio guide, the station clerk is not so kind.
,
if there's some kind of wheelchair ,
 they always help them .
 I think, pretty good
in Japanese.

   to go to the airport,

because it was very early in the morning.
   and at that time,   I was driving a    no, it's not a bicycle, 
motorcycle.
 And then, when I was driving, I got a phone call from my mother. And then  I was discussing, the   dinner.
Yeah. And suddenly,    from the right-hand side, Mister B was .
And then hit my   no, motorcycle.
Then I dropped the cell phone.
I was so mad. And then I asked him, "Please, or you should repair my    motorcycle.".  then Businessman called the  police officer. Then he claimed police officer. "       he was talking with somebody while he were running, so it's not my fault.", he said. Then police officer decided   the 
 businessman does not have any fault. And then,  he went to the airport. And the officer is gone. And then my   motorcycle  was towed away.
