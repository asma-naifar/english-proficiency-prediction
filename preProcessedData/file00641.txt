I hate cooking.<nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> At first, <F>er</F> when I began to live alone,<F>erm</F> I thought cooking was very fun for me.<OL>But</OL> <F>er</F> gradually, I became to hate.<F>Hm</F>. I'm not good at cooking.<nvs>laughter</nvs>My hobby is going shopping,watching movies,and talking with my friends over the phone <OL>for a long time</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>. So many thing.<OL>It's secret</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Secret.<F>Hmm</F>. I like many kinds of <.></.> movies. <F>Hmm</F>. But recently, I like to watch the movies which is about love story.<OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.Because,<F>erm</F> I don't need to think about <F>er</F> difficult topics when I see the love story. It is very <F>hmm</F> <.></.> amazing. No? <nvs>laughter</nvs> It is very fun and <.></.> <F>uhm</F> good <OL>to see</OL>.No need to think about difficult topics.<OL>So I</OL> like.<F>Erm</F>. My favorite movie is "Chocolat". Do you know?Maybe it was shown last year,or this year. I forgot. But <F>erm</F> <R>the</R> the beginning of this year,<F>er</F> I went to the United States to study English for <OL>short</OL><F>er</F> for about a month.At that time, I had a chance to see "Chocolat" <OL>in English</OL>in the U. S.But I couldn't have <F>erm</F> enough knowledge in English. So it was very difficult for me to understand the contents of the movie in English. But the <.></.> <F>uhm</F> scene and the pictures and <??></??>in the movie were very good.So I was very moved.<OL>So</OL> if I had a chance, I wanna see that movie again in <OL>Japanese</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><H pn="school name1">XXX03</H>?I belong to the <?>departure</?> of Literature One. And my major is humanities and liberal art.<F>Erm</F> I'm most interested in linguistics.The English pronunciation by Japanese people and their weak point in speaking English.<F>Hmm</F>.Future dream?<F>Hmm</F>. If I can, <F>er</F> I wanna get a job which is connected to <.></.> foreign countries.<OL>For example</OL>, <F>er</F> the trading companies,or <F>hmm</F> tourism.Something like that.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. Yes. I think, maybe, this picture is about the classes.I can see the teacher who is wearing a purple <SC>suit</SC> skirt and purple shoes.<F>Hm</F>. She is teaching math to the students.<SC>And</SC> but the <.></.> <F>hmm</F> almost all of them <.></.> don't listen to what,<OL>the teacher</OL> said. <F>Hmm</F>. I can find the students <R>who</R> <.></.> who are chattering with other students.And the student who is drinking tea or <.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs> soft drink,and listening to music.<OL>And</OL> <F>oh</F> I can see the student who is using mobile phone.Maybe she doesn't listen to what the teacher says.But one of the students <laughter>try</laughter> to concentrate on the class,in the front of classrooms.And <F>erm</F> <.></.> the student who is in <.></.> the front line,is <.></.> <SC>chewin</SC> eating chewing gum.I don't think he looks very young.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>He is wearing <F>er</F> glasses.<F>Hmm</F>. And some of the girls,<.></.> are doing make-up,and <SC>nailing art</SC> nail <OL>art</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Ah</F>. To tell the truth,<F>er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <F>er</F> two years ago or three years ago,I really wanted to be a English teacher at <SC>high school stu</SC> high school. But nowadays, like you said, the students at high school,were dropping out.That's why it is very hard for me to be an English teacher. Like that kind of circumstances. So I quit to <nvs>laughter</nvs> be an English teacher.But <.></.> <F>hmm</F> <.></.> not only the <F>uh</F> <F>er</F> high school but also <F>er</F> the university like <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H>,some of the students try to use the mobile phone during the classes.So I think it doesn't matter <F>uhm</F> <.></.> of <F>erm</F> the problem nowadays. I think, maybe, long time ago, there must be a similar <.></.> <F>hmm</F> kind of accident, no, accident, <F>hmm</F> was happened. But <.></.> the number of students <SC>who try to</SC> <.></.> who don't try to listen to <.></.> the stories and <.></.> classes, what the teacher said,is increasing <OL>these days</OL>.<CO>And show</CO>. <OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.That's why.But <F>hmm</F> I don't agree with the attitude of there.Because the teacher had to,study for the classes beforehand.<SC>But</SC> <F>uhm</F> so students have to respect the attitude of <SC>s</SC> teachers, I <OL>think</OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>. <ctxt>The interviewee is reading the card.</ctxt> <F>Hmm</F>.O K.Excuse me. But <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>the other day, I bought a skirt,at this shop.<OL>But</OL> the size was too small for me. So if you can, I really want you to <SC>change</SC> exchange.But is it O K?<OL><F>Mm</F>. No</OL>.Because when I tried to buy it, <R>there was</R> <F>mm</F> there was anyone,<R>except for the</R> <F>erm</F> except for the people who was at the register. So I couldn't <.></.> ask her.<CO>So</CO>.<F>Hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.But not only the size but also I found <F>er</F> stains,on the skirt. So,<R>how about</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs>how about <OL>this</OL>?Yes.<F>Oh</F> I <OL>see</OL>.Then, but the fastener was broken,<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> when I <nvs>laughter</nvs> brought it back to my home. How <OL>about this</OL>?I haven't tried it on <SC>ever</SC> never. <nvs>laughter</nvs>No. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><R>I</R></OL> <R>I forgot</R> I <OL>forgot</OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.How long will it take?<R>Not</R> not so long? <OL>Really</OL>?<nvs>laughter</nvs>If I can.<F>Hmm</F>. A little expensive is O K.<OL>Then</OL>? <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Really</OL>?Then, I'll buy <F>erm</F> this shirt.This must be a little expensive,than this skirt.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>Thank</OL> you. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Thank <OL>you</OL>.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I don't think so. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I've never tried it. <F>Oh</F>. But,<F>erm</F> <R>last month</R>last month, I went to <.></.> the U. S.And <SC>the day <.></.> <F>er</F> on</SC> the day I was planning to go back to Japan was <SC>the four</SC> four days later,<F>er</F> of the terrorism,in <.></.> New York. So I couldn't take on a plane I was planning to. So,I tried to call,to the airline company to change my flight,or to confirm my reservation.At that time, they said <F>erm</F> the plane <R>I will</R> I will be take on will be cancelled. That's why <SC>I have to <.></.> <F>er</F> <SC>reche</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>re</SC></SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> I have to <.></.> take a new reservation again.And I did. But,in fact, the plane <R>I was</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> I was <.></.> going to take on <R>was</R> <.></.> <R>was flown</R> was flown to Japan.So they did <.></.> <F>erm</F><F>erm</F> different,news to me.<SC>Misunderstood</SC> they misunderstood.So I couldn't take.So I had to wait for <.></.> more ten days.<OL>And during</OL> the ten days, I tried to negotiate to the airline company to <.></.> take <F>erm</F> a reservation as soon as possible to go back to Japan. It was so hard. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes. <OL>Actually</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.One day last week, the man went to the station at around eight o'clock. And when he waited for the train, he dropped his <.></.> briefcase <.></.> <F>erm</F> to the <.></.> <R>rail</R> railroad of train. And he ask, <F>ah</F> no. <.></.> The reason why he dropped the briefcase was he was hit by <.></.> the elbows of the <R>next</R> <.></.> next man. So he complained to the man <.></.> <SC>to</SC> <laughter>maybe</laughter> to <SC>pick up</SC> pick his briefcase up.But the next man couldn't understand what he said. At that time, the train came into the station.And he was almost hit by the train.<F>Hmm</F>. He was very surprised.But he was safe.And maybe <F>hmm</F> <SC>the man</SC> the next man <.></.> asked the person who worked at the station to try to pick <.></.> the briefcase up. And he did. And the man who dropped his <R>briefcase</R> briefcase could get it.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Hmm</F>. <F>Er</F>. In comparison with the transportation in Tokyo,for example, the time schedule of bus <R>is not</R><nvs>laughter</nvs> is not <SC>right</SC> <OL>correct</OL>.And <SC>it is very</SC> it was very difficult for me to take on the bus because maybe I could find only one buses,in an hour.<R>And</R> <F>ah</F> <.></.>and <R>when</R> <F>mm</F> when I went to <.></.> the U S, I went to the English conversation school.At first, I was said that it was <.></.> <F>er</F> possible for me to go there by bus.But,the time schedule wasn't correct. So I had to go there by bike.And at first, I didn't know thatthe bicycle in the U. S. <SC>had</SC> have to run <.></.> on the right side of the street.And <nvs>laughter</nvs> I,ran on the left side.<CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>And <..></..> when I took on the bike, <R>I was always,<F>er</F> put</R> I was always put on a <.></.> <F>er</F> how can I say? <F>Er</F> I was always shouted by the drivers of car. But I didn't understand why <laughter>they</laughter> shouted to <OL>me</OL>.And after that, <SC>I w</SC> <F>mm</F> a friend of mine said <.></.> that the,bicycle has to run on the,right side of the street. So I <.></.> could understand,<OL>the reason</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>.After this interview?<F>Ahh</F>. I will go back to my home.And <F>ah</F> I have to write an English essay to hand in to <laughter>my</laughter> <.></.> school.Because <F>erm</F> to tell the truth, I will <?>reply</?> for the programs of <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> as an exchange student. <R>And</R>and I have to hand in the paper,by the end of this week.I have to write not only in Japanese but also in <OL>English</OL>.At the same time, I have to explain the reason why I chose the university in the U.
