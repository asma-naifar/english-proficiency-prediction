Hello.
My name is .
 meet you, too.
I live in Waseda.
 is very near from here.
 four or five minutes,
on foot.
 Yes.
Sure.
.
No.

 Cooking is very troublesome for me. I hate cooking.

 when I began to live alone,
 I thought cooking was very fun for me.
 gradually, I became to hate.
. I'm not good at cooking.

My hobby is going shopping,
watching movies,
and talking with my friends over the phone .
. So many thing.
. 
Secret.
. I like many kinds of . But recently, I like to watch the movies which is about love story.
.
Because,
 I don't need to think about difficult topics when I see the love story. It is very It is very fun and good .
No need to think about difficult topics.
 like.
. My favorite movie is "Chocolat". Do you know?
Maybe it was shown last year,
or this year. I forgot. But the beginning of this year,
 I went to the United States to study English for 
 for about a month.
At that time, I had a chance to see "Chocolat" 
in the U. S.
But I couldn't have enough knowledge in English. So it was very difficult for me to understand the contents of the movie in English. But the scene and the pictures and 
in the movie were very good.
So I was very moved.
 if I had a chance, I wanna see that movie again in .


?
I belong to the of Literature One. And my major is humanities and liberal art.
 I'm most interested in linguistics.
The English pronunciation by Japanese people and their weak point in speaking English.
.
Future dream?
. If I can, I wanna get a job which is connected to foreign countries.
, the trading companies,
or tourism.
Something like that.
.
. Yes. I think, maybe, this picture is about the classes.
I can see the teacher who is wearing a purple skirt and purple shoes.
. She is teaching math to the students.
 but the almost all of them don't listen to what,
 said. . I can find the students who are chattering with other students.
And the student who is drinking tea or soft drink,
and listening to music.
 I can see the student who is using mobile phone.
Maybe she doesn't listen to what the teacher says.
But one of the students to concentrate on the class,
in the front of classrooms.
And the front line,
is eating chewing gum.
I don't think he looks very young.

He is wearing glasses.
. And some of the girls,
 are doing make-up,
and nail .
.
.
.
. To tell the truth,
 two years ago or three years ago,
I really wanted to be a English teacher at high school. But nowadays, like you said, the students at high school,
were dropping out.
That's why it is very hard for me to be an English teacher. Like that kind of circumstances. So I quit to be an English teacher.
But high school but also the university like ,
some of the students try to use the mobile phone during the classes.
So I think it doesn't matter the problem nowadays. I think, maybe, long time ago, there must be a similar kind of accident, no, accident, was happened. But the stories and classes, what the teacher said,
is increasing .
. .
That's why.
But I don't agree with the attitude of there.
Because the teacher had to,
study for the classes beforehand.
 so students have to respect the attitude of teachers, I .
.
.
.
.
. .
O K.
Excuse me. But 
the other day, I bought a skirt,
at this shop.
 the size was too small for me. So if you can, I really want you to exchange.
But is it O K?
. No.
Because when I tried to buy it, there was anyone,
 except for the people who was at the register. So I couldn't ask her.
.
.
.
But not only the size but also I found stains,
on the skirt. So,
 
how about ?
Yes.
 I .
Then, but the fastener was broken,
 brought it back to my home. How ?
I haven't tried it on never. 
No. 
 I .
.
.
How long will it take?
 not so long? ?

If I can.
. A little expensive is O K.
? 
?
Then, I'll buy this shirt.
This must be a little expensive,
than this skirt.

 you. 

Thank .
. 
Yes.

I don't think so. 
I've never tried it. . But,
 
last month, I went to the U. S.
And on four days later,
 of the terrorism,
in New York. So I couldn't take on a plane I was planning to. So,
I tried to call,
to the airline company to change my flight,
or to confirm my reservation.
At that time, they said the plane I will be take on will be cancelled. That's why I have to take a new reservation again.
And I did. But,
in fact, the plane I was was flown to Japan.
So they did 
 different,
news to me.
 they misunderstood.
So I couldn't take.
So I had to wait for more ten days.
 the ten days, I tried to negotiate to the airline company to a reservation as soon as possible to go back to Japan. It was so hard. 
Yes.

Yes. .

One day last week, the man went to the station at around eight o'clock. And when he waited for the train, he dropped his to the railroad of train. And he ask, no. the elbows of the to pick his briefcase up.
But the next man couldn't understand what he said. At that time, the train came into the station.
And he was almost hit by the train.
. He was very surprised.
But he was safe.
And maybe the next man the briefcase up. And he did. And the man who dropped his briefcase could get it.
.
. . In comparison with the transportation in Tokyo,
for example, the time schedule of bus 
 is not .
And it was very difficult for me to take on the bus because maybe I could find only one buses,
in an hour.
 
and when I went to the U S, I went to the English conversation school.
At first, I was said that it was possible for me to go there by bus.
But,
the time schedule wasn't correct. So I had to go there by bike.
And at first, I didn't know that
the bicycle in the U. S. have to run on the right side of the street.
And I,
ran on the left side.
. 
And when I took on the bike, I was always,
 put how can I say? I was always shouted by the drivers of car. But I didn't understand why shouted to .
And after that, a friend of mine said that the,
bicycle has to run on the,
right side of the street. So I could understand,
.

After this interview?

And I have to write an English essay to hand in to school.
Because to tell the truth, I will for the programs of as an exchange student. 
and I have to hand in the paper,

I have to write not only in Japanese but also in .
At the same time, I have to explain the reason why I chose the university in the U. S.
