Hello.
My name is .
Yes, please.
I'm fine, thank you. And you?
I live near Nakaurawa Station   in Saitama City.
   because      I was born in Meguro in Tokyo, so I don't know  much about Saitama City.
Yes.
 I like  Saitama City.
.   because   everything is  convenient in Tokyo.  .    but    there are much green
 in Saitama City. . It is very good point.
.
Yes.  I live with my husband and a seven year daughter,
 she is in the first grade of elementary school.
 my husband  is a scholar.  he is a professor  of university. He majors in the economic history of Germany.     from June nineteen ninety-seven to the end of March  nineteen ninety-eight,  we lived in Frankfurt
in Germany.     there, we lived in the international guest house of   University. . So we had  many chances  to talk with many foreigners.
  it was very good experience.
.
 now? .
 . So     if I have free time,   I  eat out for lunch with my friends    or I   read  books at home or    I like English very much.
So   .
.
 .
Maybe     this is a restaurant.       there is a couple   eating dinner.  now,      he's now tasting the wine. .     maybe he said,  "It's very good.". . And   behind the couple,  a lady  plays the piano. And other two couples are eating a dinner. 
Yes, sometimes.
. I think   this restaurant is more gorgeous   than the restaurant  we often go to.       they are  well-dressed. But  we usually go to casual restaurant  in ordinary clothes.  . And we  seldom drink alcohol.
.  Yes.
Yes. .
    my favorite restaurant is a French restaurant  in Omotesando. .  the name is a Les .  the price is reasonable   but the restaurant serves very   elegant   dishes.  I like it very much.  maybe    many women     like the dishes. 
.
 hold on, .
    I'd like to go to New York        in the earliest way.
.  how much does it cost?
One hundred dollars.   when  start?
Ten minutes. .             where lane  to get on the train?
Platform number four? O K. .  I'll have . . .
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes,
.    I live in the guest house of the university.  many  people from foreign countries lived here.        my neighbors   were the people from the United States and India, so      particular with    Indian,  we share the kitchen.
And  the Indian wife and I  cooked everyday at the kitchen, so   she teach me  many kinds of Indian dishes, so  it was very interesting experience. So      before the  Indian  scholar couple    go back to their country,   we had a party. So       sorry,  that was a party  which  we cooked  ourselves. .  . And I cooked tempura and  the couple from the United States  cooked spaghetti and salad and the Indian couple cooked  tandoori chicken   and     vegetable   curry   and  rice. So  they were  all   delicious and we enjoyed it very much.

.   . One day last week,     a young couple was walking  in the street   on the rainy day. .  .  "Meow". .      a cat's cry  came from a box. So   they found it. .  and she  pull out the cat from the box. .  in    we take this  cat   to our house. May I?".   he said,   "  I don't like cats. But  O K.".     so they came home  with the cat.
 no, I've never .
. I'm sorry,  I don't like animals.
So   I've never thought of  keeping   dog or cat.
     I'd like to have a cup of tea at Rihga Royal Hotel. 
   because  I feel  relax and   I feel gorgeous.
