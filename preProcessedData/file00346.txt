And like it was a really, really cute cat, but like we didn't to know what to do. And my friend said "I'm allergic to cat. I can't bring it to home.". And like my house like everybody is always out. so, no one could take care of it. so I was wondering and my friend was allergic, so he didn't want me to bring it but I thought I could ask my sisters they help me take care of the cat. So I brought it home. But, anyway, my friend didn't like it because he was allergic. Yeah. I brought it home. And, yeah, it's now well. We have it in my house now.

What?
I like pets, but I don't like cats. I like dogs. Yeah. Yeah.
. Like when you're lonely, you could talk to the pet. they are good listener. And I don't know, but they are really cute, I think. Yeah.
No, we don't have any pets. long time ago, we used to buy like a guppy, a kind of fish, called "guppy". But nobody was taking care of, started eating each other . . So we never buy any pets.
This afternoon, maybe, I'll go to a bookshop. I'd like to buy books. Every time, like spend a lot of money .
