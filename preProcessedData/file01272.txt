Hello.My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sure. Go ahead.<F>Well</F> <F>er</F> I lived in Canada for <R>fif</R> fifteen years. And while I was there, people couldn't pronounce my proper Japanese name, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Then they started to call me like <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> and <F>ur</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.So ended up in this name, <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.And it's a shortened <F>eh</F> <F>uh</F> <R?>as</R?> as <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<F>Er</F> originally I wanted to study English there.And I went there as a student.And I ended up marrying with a Canadian person. And <F>er</F> I just stayed there as a result.<F>Well</F> <F>um</F> I think I needed a change of scenery.And <SC>my</SC> I was having trouble with <F>er</F> my boyfriend <OL>then</OL>.So <F>er</F> I had to come home and <F>er</F> look <?>for</?> something different.Yeah.<F>Er</F> no. Just home. Because <F>er</F> my father <SC>passed a</SC> had passed away a few years back prior my returning.So I thought I should be good to my mother.<OL><F>Er</F></OL> <?>in order</?> to visit her and <SC>clo</SC> <F>uh</F> live closer to her.And <F>er</F> so long as I live in Japan,I could visit<F>er</F> as in terms of <?>our relations</?>.<OL>So</OL> I didn't consider any other country.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hmm</F>. No as often <R>as</R> <F>uh</F> as I should. Because <F>uh</F> she is in hospital <F>er</F> right now. So actually <F>er</F> she's bedridden. <F>Hmm</F>. So I should be visiting her <F>mm</F> more times but <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I simply can't because <F>er</F> just my husband and I started a new business.So it's not a good reason to say "I don't have enough time.".But <F>er</F> the reality is that.<F>Hm</F>.My <F>er</F> elder sister and her husband.They are very kind. And they live close to the hospital. So they are taking care of my mother.<F>Hmm</F>. O K. <F>Er</F> she's four years older than I am, I think. And she's been a housewife all the time. She was, at one time, <F>er</F> <SC>tea</SC> like a teacher, but after she got married, she just stayed home,took care of her sons and<OL>husband</OL>.So, a typical Japanese housewife.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.O K. <F>Hmm</F>. This is a classroom in high school, maybe. And <F>er</F> I think this lady is <SC?>t</SC?> giving a lesson in mathematics. But the <F>er</F> students' attitudes are various. Yes. Only one, <R>I thin</R> I think I see in the front row, this boy in the middle, yeah he's listening to what she's saying. But other students are doing their own things like <F>er</F> one boy, chewing gum, looking outside, and girls are talking with the boys. One boy is listening to <SC>the</SC> this <F>er</F> music while drinking some tea. And this girl is <F>er</F> sending <F>er</F> E-mail, I think. So it's not a very <F>er</F> good class.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Well</F> I didn't think <F>er</F> of English. When I wanted to go to Canada, I wanted to see abroad.Something different from Japan.So <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I didn't really think of "O K, I'm going to study," but I wanted to see the different culture. And I had friends there. So <F>er</F> I got into <??></??> to visit some friends there. <F>Hm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Hm</F>. It's so long agoso <F>er</F> it's hard to remember. But <F>er</F> I guess in my high school days, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> we <F>oh</F> all wore uniforms.And <F>er</F> <SC>I guess we ha</SC> <SC>I</SC> at least I paid respect to <SC>what I'm lis</SC> <F>uh</F> what I was taught. And then I tried to listen to all the teachers.You know. So the attitude was quite different. Yeah.<F>Hmm</F>. I'm not sure. But the <F>er</F> it's <F>er</F> <.></.> too much influence from <F>er</F> Western countries? I don't know maybe <F>ur</F> people <F>er</F> stress on freedom <?>or</?> other things.For example, uniforms. <SC>I</SC> <SC>they <R>s</R> start to say</SC> they started to say, "O K, we are individual persons so we should be able to decide what to wear to school.". So some schools, they don't have uniforms<OL>these days</OL>.<OL>But</OL> at that time, <SC>so many years ago</SC> <F>well</F> forty years ago,<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>er</F> we didn't have that much freedom or influence. So maybe that's the difference. And <SC?>its</SC?> <F>eh</F> system is changing.<OL>Yes</OL>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.Excuse me.<OL>Yes</OL>. Yes. I don't know who to ask. But <F>er</F> I missed the train I made a reservation for.And <F>er</F> <F>er</F> is it possible for you to give me authorization to give me refund or change to other trains?<F>Hmm</F>. But <F>er</F> see, <F>er</F> <SC>when I</SC> <R>wh</R> when I was about to leave the house, I had <F>er</F> an important phone call from overseasand I had to talk with this manager in <F>er</F> oversea countries. So <F>er</F> it took <SC>a long time</SC> longer than I had expected. So <F>er</F> I couldn't plan this one. So if it's possible, I wouldn't mind waiting here <F>um</F> for another train maybe <F>ur</F> one hour or one and a half hour.<OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.Yeah. But like I said, like I work for a company and <R>we</R> we have a various <F>er</F> branch offices <SC>national</SC> <F>er</F> worldwide.<CO>And <SC>when I think of the</SC> when you think of the time differences, sometimes we get phone calls <SC>in a</SC> in awkward hours like early in the morning or</CO>.So I couldn't plan. <?>There are</?> something emergency.<OL>Something</OL> <SC>im</SC> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> really important thing is happening in <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> branch offices,and <F>er</F> couldn't just cut off. Yeah.<F>Oh</F>.O K. I wouldn't mind at all. <OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.Thank you for your help.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.It's a language school. And <F>er</F> we are <F>er</F> providing services to companies in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. And <F>oh</F> <F>er</F> <SC>we</SC> since we have a basic contract with <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>, we can send <F>er</F> teachers to teach English to their branch offices.So <F>um</F> that's what we are trying to do.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Hm</F>. The most important point is, I think, <F>er</F> our approach. Like there are hundreds of language schools nationwide. And if we establish a company like similar to them like Nova or GEOS, we don't have any feature, special characteristics. So I guess you have to focus on <F>er</F> something unique, <SC>not</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> that is not be learned at <SC>different schools</SC> other schools, I mean.<F>Oh</F> we try to <F>er</F> use the <F>er</F> proficiency program<F>er</F> <SC>by</SC> <SC>which is, <F>er</F> I guess, a program</SC> it's a program by <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H> system, I think. And <F>er</F> of course <SC>I can't</SC> we can't <SC>do the exact program</SC> deliver the <F>er</F> exact courses. But <F>er</F> eliciting some <F>er</F> <.></.> speeches or conversations or ideas from students, <F>er</F> I think those are <SC>more i</SC> very important <OL>matters</OL>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Hmm</F></OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K. <F>Um</F> one day last week, I was <F>er</F> going to church on Sunday. And <F>um</F> I was enjoying the <F>er</F> drive. And it's only <SC>fi</SC> five minutes from home. But all of a sudden, I saw <SC>a green motorcyclist</SC> a green motorbike. And <F>er</F> this guy was talking <R>on</R> on the cellphone. Maybe <SC>she was</SC> he was talking to her <F>er</F> girlfriend. And <F>er</F> unexpectedly <F>ur</F> he <F>er</F> dropped his cellphone and <F>er</F> <SC>we bumped each other</SC> we collided <SC>each</SC> to each other. And <F>er</F> unfortunately his <R>tail</R> tail lamp was broken from the accident. And <F>er</F> <SC>he spea</SC> he claimed <SC>this is my fault</SC> "This is your fault.". But <F>er</F> <F>er</F> I couldn't agree with his <F>er</F> claim, so we called a <R>poli</R> police officer. <SC>There he ca</SC> <F>uh</F> one police officer and took a statement. <F>Er</F> I and <F>er</F> the <F>ur</F> motorcyclist, <SC>we both <F>er</F> claimed <F>er</F> what happened</SC> we explain what happened. And <F>um</F> <.></.> unfortunately, <F>er</F> his motorbike was <F>er</F> damaged too bad, so he couldn't <F>er</F> <SC>d</SC> <F>uh</F> ride on it any further. So <F>er</F> it had to be taken to the mechanics.O K.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Ahh</F> I think <SC>they are <?>not</?></SC> <F>er</F> in general they are very kind.O K. And <R>they</R> <SC>they s</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>when it snow</SC> especially, when it snows <F>er</F> we tend to drive very carefully.<F>Hmm</F>. And I think <F>er</F> very <F>er</F> lenient or generous, should I say. For example, <SC>when we <SC>turn</SC> <R>ma</R> <SC>make left</SC> make</SC> when we make right turns,they let us go, even.So <F>um</F> they're <F>um</F> this patient.And driving manners are generally good.<F>Hm</F>. Because I guess, in countrysides, when it snows or when it's icy,I think all of us<OL>realize</OL> how torturous it could be.So <OL>we drive</OL> very carefully.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Well</F> I'm going to have <SC>some</SC> <F>er</F> a reunion with a friend of mine.And then go home. And give lessons to my students.<nvs>laughter</nvs>Yes. Evening lessons. Yeah.But if I can't make it, I'll have to cancel it. But <R>I</R> I will try to be homeby seven, I think.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Er</F> semi-private. Yeah.Thank you very much.
