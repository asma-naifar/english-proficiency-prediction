And <F>well</F> so <F>mm</F> and <R>a</R> as I told you, my major is <SC>education</SC> English education and American literatures, so I take <SC>i</SC> <SC>more important on</SC> <R>mo</R> more importance on <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> English education. But unfortunately in the course, yeah, <R>ye</R> yeah, the Department of the Literature Two, they don't have many classes for <R>E</R> English education. So <SC>I have to go to</SC> I have to take <F>er</F> some classes in the Department of Education<F>er</F> in the morning or in the afternoon just before the classes I am taking at <F>er</F> <SC>Lit</SC> <F>uh</F> the Department of Literature Two.O K.

So there are many people <SC>on the</SC> at this <JP>gerende</JP>. And some of them are skiing.And some of them are children and they are playing <SC>snowballs</SC> with snowballs.And <SC>the childrens are four</SC> the four children are fighting with snowballs and they look very happy.And in the lodge, <F>ah</F> there is a cafeteria and two people are drinking <F>ah</F> something, <F>um</F> probably coffee or tea and they are talking and drinking in that lodge. And <F>ah</F> <F>mm</F> they are <SC>s</SC> one, two, three, four, five, six, <R>six people</R> six people skiing.<F>Ahn</F> <R>one of</R> one of them <SC>is</SC> <F>ah</F> seems to be a leader who is wearing <F>ah</F> yellow coat. And he is shouting something to other people, probably. And <F>oh</F> <F>ah</F> there is one guy who just fall down <SC>or</SC> <F>ah</F> and he is wearing a black <R>s</R> skies.And <?>probably</?> <R>he</R> he might broke <SC>his</SC> one of his legs.How awful. <CO>And</CO>.<F>Mm</F> yes, I used to.<R>I</R> I skied.And I like skating when I was in elementary school.But now, <R>I</R> <F>mm</F> I prefer walking in the wood.Yeah.<F>Well</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>I</R> I have <F>ah</F> the experience of skiing.But I haven't <F>a</F> tried any snowboard. So <SC>I have</SC> <F>mm</F> I don't have <SC>a</SC> much <F>eh</F> <F>a-ah</F> <R>in</R> information about snowboard.But <F>a</F> the snowboard <R>is</R> <F>ah</F> is a tool <F>ah</F> it has <R>one</R> one board. But <F>ah</F> the ski has two board on the people's <F>ah</F> feet, and <F>uh</F> in my opinion, <R>s</R> skiing is much safer than snowboard.<F>Ah</F> because I've heard many accident happened in the skiing place with <F>ah</F> the people who are <F>uh</F> snowboarding.So <F>mm</F> that's why <SC>I thou</SC> I think the snowboard is a bit dangerous.And, yeah, if I have a chance, <SC>I like to</SC> I'd like to try snowboard.O K.O K.Hello, this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.<OL>So</OL> <F>a</F> <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>?
