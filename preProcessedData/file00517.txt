?
. .
 my name is .
 yeah. Sure. .
 nice to meet you, too. 
 this evening?  I'm    little tired.
Because  today, I was very busy.  but, today  Friday night, so I was very relived.

 .
  yeah. It's very hot.
And very humid.
No. I don't like it. I like  winter better than summer.
Yeah.
Yes. .
 yeah. .   forty minutes.
No. High school.
Private high school.
     I'm a teacher. 
Job? . So  my school is a private high school. So, now,  I am in charge of the third year students. . That means most of them  will   ready to go to university. So, now, everyday,  I had a   interview with my students  which university they should go. I have to advise them.
. So pretty tired. 
  that means,  usually,  what do you do  in the university.   what are you interested in.  always I will ask them.
. Yes. 
 I live alone.
.
Free time? .  so I like traveling. . So,   when Sunday and Saturday are free,     I plan to go to travel. . But, now,  my father  is sick. So  he's is a hospital.
, I have to go back to my parents' house. So, now, I don't have enough time to take a trip. But, if I have a lot of free time, maybe, I will take a trip.
Visit. .    it depends on the  feeling.  . So,     when I was tired, I like to go to a foreign country.
  especially,  Europe and America. But, when I'm  very tired, I don't want to go to Asian countries.
Because,  if I go there, I will be very tired. Because   there are a lot of people.  .  but, when  I am very fine, I prefer   going to Asian countries. And I'm very interested in that countries.
. No.
Yeah.   So the place  in the classroom. So a  female teacher is  explaining  something. Maybe, I think this is a     math class. And   there are several students in the classroom. But   it  seems that most of them are not  interested in the class. And one of them is drinking something. And  one of the girls  is  calculating. And two of them are talking. Only one student is going to study the class. And     the teacher is  explaining very hard. But she doesn't  look at the students. So it  seems that she  doesn't notice the students' attitudes.

.  there is a big difference.
.  because our school is a  girl's high school, so, only girls. So they are very quiet.  and, anyway,      they try to study or they pretend to study.  But they are not noisy. And, if  one of  my students are going to drink something,     we get angry with her.
  so they can't do
 except studying.
.  yeah.  it seems. 
 I don't know how  they understood the content. 
.
.
 no.
O K.
   yeah.  I'm calling because    I feel very uncomfortable   because  I had a bad experience in the tour.
    yesterday, I came back to  Japan from Germany.    I joined a pack tour to Germany in your company.  and,   brochure,  we have a castle.
.  Castle.  and they said  we can enter the castle. So  I was very expecting  because I could  enter the castle. But,  when I went there,   the castle was closed.
So  we couldn't enter it. So I think   your explanation    was very different.
.
Yeah. But you know ?    it's very expensive,     I think you to     pay money back.
.
Because   I paid a lot of money. Because  especially, the tour I joined is a very gorgeous tour. The tour was very famous. So I  joined it.
.
Yeah. But   pamphlet said  we can  enter the castle.       like you    to do something for us.
.
 but,  now,  I'm not planning to go to another trip in a few years. So  I don't like it.
  I want you to pay some .
.
 refund? 
 ? Yeah.
.
 thank you.
O K.
.
Yeah.
 yes.
. Yeah.
. . Two years ago, I went to Germany by myself. But,  during winter time, it was very cold in Germany.
And it had a lot of snow. And  I went to    a   famous small town in Germany.  but   it was a Christmas season. So,  maybe, December twenty-fourth or something like that.
But I was very surprised. Most of shops and restaurants were closed. So  it was very hard to find a restaurant.
 So  there was only    small restaurant
.
.
 very differ</SC> I was very surprised.
.
 yes. But I enjoyed. .
 no.
.
 yeah.
. Can I use she ?
. 
So,  now, it was a dinner time. So  a lady was  going to make  supper. And she opened the refrigerator. But she was very  surprised because  there was nothing in it. So   she went to a supermarket by car. And she bought  several items. And,  of course, she paid. And she bought a lot of food. . And   she put the food she bought   in the car. . And,  after she went back home, she began to cook. And      she like hot cakes or something .
.

You know,  I will go to my parents' house.
