Usually <F>ur</F> from my house,I go to the station <F>ur</F> with my husband with his driving, so I don't get <F>ur</F> rain. Then from <F>ur</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> Station to my office,always they have <F>um</F> <F>ur</F> the roofs <F>uh</F> all the way<OL>to the office</OL>. So usually I don't have <SC>a</SC> <F>ur</F> any troublewith raining.O K.<F>Urm</F> right now, I am in <JP>eigyou kaihatsu</JP> departmentwhich are to <F>ur</F> the all <SC>the opening schools</SC> the new schools.And for that, we have <F>er</F> a lot of documents that we have to <F>ur</F> file.So I do that.And also we get many phone calls from <F>ur</F> like construction companies <R>and</R> and <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> shopping centers.And usually I take <F>ur</F> all the phones, and <F>ur</F> take the message. <SC>And</SC> but <F>ur</F> my most favorite one <nvs>laughter</nvs> in my department is <F>uh</F> <F>urm</F> sending the newsletters about the oversea schools to all the schools in Japan. Like more than fine hundreds schools in Japan,I <F>ur</F> kind of makenewsletters, <F>ur</F> get information from overseas schools,and I can introduce that our company has <F>ur</F> this great network.<F>Urm</F> and <F>ur</F> I'm very happy that many people readthat letter.Difficulties. <OL><F>Mhm</F></OL>.No, I just enjoy it.Yeah, I'm just enjoying making it.So no difficulties. Because usually if I ask something to <SC>the</SC> our overseas schools' managers, they usually respond me very <F>ur</F> quickly so I can <F>ur</F> get information easily. Sometimes when I don't have any <F>ur</F> responses,I just <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> collect information from the <F>ur</F> internet, <F>ur</F> the other websites,then I read books, and then I just try to get the pictures only from the schools and I write everything <F>ur</F> by myself.It's fun also.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Ur</F> <OL><R>I</R></OL>I will <F>ur</F> send E-mail again,And I try to find somebody else at school, too. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ur</F> usually managers are always <F>um</F> busy, <OL>busy, busy</OL>.So I try to get somebody <F>uh</F> very close to <OL>the manager</OL>.Yeah.Sometimes,yes.Sometimes nothing.<F>Ur</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><R>No</R> <CO>no re</CO></OL>.

And <F>ur</F> this is <F>ur</F> a residence area. And I can see a big house and two dogs are in front of the house and two kids are playing balls. And <F>ur</F> one girl is enjoying the jumping rope. And there is one car <F>ur</F> on the street in front of the house. And a cat is sleeping on it. And two women are talking on the street. One of them has a dog. And there is a man <F>ur</F> jogging on the street. And also across the house, <F>ur</F> one man is reading <F>ur</F> newspaper, sitting on the bench. And all of them look very happy.Yes.<F>Mhm</F>. <F>Ur</F> this area, I think <F>ur</F> the people living there have more money than we do because that it's a big house and also they have a big yard. <F>Ur</F> but my area, <F>uh</F> many houses, and the street is not big like this.
