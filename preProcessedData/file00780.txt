So  it was February but it's not so cold.   it was  beautiful every day and yes and it just my mother and me so  we had a common interest in Paris so   we could have the very  relax travel together and I went shopping a lot.

O K. . O K, One day last week the girl and the boy    try to went to camp with their car.   they made a pack and they made a lot of staff in their car and  they went and then     they went to the lakeside and they put on the  tent.    yeah   they  cook next to the tent  but suddenly  it starts to rain and  it became very windy so the tent and the other staff, for example, their pans and their chairs are blow up and they  force to come back in their car. They couldn't stay in the tent because of the weather. So   and they drove and  in the hard rain and thunders. And then they found the hotel, the hotel called Hotel Cosmos, and then they decided to stay at the hotel but the weather outside is   still very bad but they  looked very relaxed at the hotel room.
.    yes. I think I had some troubles but not a big one, yeah.
    the travel which  I said that   I went to Paris with my mother.
And then   we didn't have a lot of cash but we had the cash card of the bank and   it is international card so  we thought we can withdraw money everywhere around the city. And so we tried to withdraw money at the bank  in Paris but we couldn't because  it was the City bank card but the City bank has the   treatment with  another bank so  we thought we can withdraw the money   at A T M of another bank so we tried several times but we couldn't.  so  we very confused and I knew   there are some branches of City banks in Paris so   we went there and we asked them, and they said why don't you try at the City bank A T M so and then I tried and we could get the money.
Yeah, at the City bank A T M. But only at the City bank. So I don't know  why we couldn't do at another bank's A T M, but that were a little trouble 
but it's fine  I could get the money finally.
 . .  after this?
 I have a class after this. I have one class and after that I will go to my ballet class.
.
. Thank you . You, too.
