Cultural difference?
Cultural difference. ,    I think that  in Australia,  everything going slow and relaxed. . You don't have to feel any rush . You can be yourself.    how do I say,  the different kind of pressure  in this country. So,     like,    when you communicate with something  to the     older people. Because   I've been in university about the  three, four years.   I was calling  the professors  in their first names. So   you were like,  you know, talking like your friends or something. So, now, I'm in, you know, here Japan,  have to  show some  respect to  .

One lady, I think, playing piano. Then,   it's  seven o'clock, maybe, in the afternoon. Of course.  dressing up. So, should be afternoon. And  one table already  enjoying dinner since  no one's serving them. . One table,  one waiter's serving, maybe, the wine or some drink.  just  the one table, it might be just   already finished  dinner or   I don't know, maybe, the dishes just arrived, something. .

 this kind of formal,  we have to dress up. .
Just,  you know,   there is something called the  food hall.   it's     I mean,  not restaurant. It's kind of the  integrated the  fast food, .

Australian culture  based on the British.
. So  that's .    I don't .
