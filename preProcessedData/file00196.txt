. One day last week, I and my boyfriend went to Shibuya to eat a dinner.
 it was rainy day. But the dinner is so delicious and I was very fine.
. And on the way to his house, he said, " can you hear someone's voice?". But I couldn't hear it. But carefully, to I tried to hear the voice, and finally, on the way. in the box is so I'm sorry, it was so cold and I think a cat has a cold. So I said him, " I bring him to my house.". But he said, "We can't, because we lived a mansion so we can't have a pets.".
But I didn't give up because the cat is very cute and I think I must be sad if we leave him alone.
 so we fight it. And finally, I won.
So I decided that I bring the cats. but it becomes secret between he and me. So and from next day, the cats became of one my family.
 I don't have experienced it. I have never had a any pets. But maybe cat or dog or someone can't speak to to human. So we must understand what they want or what they feel.
So we must food or place
