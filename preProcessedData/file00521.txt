 there are six students in this classroom. And the teacher is teaching, I think it's mathematics. And, in the first row, two students are studying hard. But one of them is falling asleep. And, from the second rows, students are having a drink and talking to a friend. So I guess this is a noisy classroom and it seems like most of the students are not working hard.
And the teacher doesn't seems to be angry. maybe, she is used to this situation all the time. 
.
.
.
Yeah. I used to like math. But I don't study math at university.

 I lived in Australia. And their math class were separated into four classes with the students' level. And, because I like I was in the top class. And most of the students were Asian students. And, yes, they were always very keen to study. And my math teacher was very kind, polite teacher. And, yeah, I real enjoyed the math .

 this is a very hard situation for the students who wants to study hard. .
