But one of them is <SC>sleeping</SC> <F>er</F> falling asleep. And, <F>well</F> from the second rows, <F>um</F> students <R>are</R> are having a drink and talking to a friend. So I guess this is a noisy classroom <SC?>in</SC?> and <F>um</F> it seems like most of the students are not working hard.And the teacher doesn't seems to be angry. <F>Um</F> maybe, <F>uh</F> she is used to this situation all the time. <..></..><F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Uhu</F>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.

And, <F>um</F> <F>well</F> because I like <laughter>numbers</laughter> I was in the top class. And <SC>all of</SC> most of the students were <F>er</F> Asian students. And, <F>um</F> yes, they were always very keen to study. And <F>er</F> my math teacher was <F>er</F> very kind, polite teacher. And, <SC>I</SC> yeah, I real enjoyed the math <OL>classes</OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Well</F> <SC>it's very</SC> <F>um</F> this is a very hard situation for the students who wants to study hard. <F>Hm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Uhu</F>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.O K.<OL><F>Oh</F> good evening</OL>.

And <F>well</F> I didn't have <F>er</F> enough time. So, you know, <SC>it's</SC> it was not my fault, I think.I mean, <F>er</F> the changing room was full. And <R>if</R> if there was enough space, <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I got</SC> I tried it on.

So I could easily <R>get</R> <F>um</F> get a clothes <F>erm</F> with my pocket money.

And <F>um</F> <SC>there</SC> <F>well</F> it was <F>um</F> early <R>in</R> <SC>in the e</SC> in the morning. And <F>um</F> there were so many people, and the station was very crowded. And <F>um</F> I was standing <SC>behind one</SC> behind a man. But <F>um</F> he suddenly <SC>shook his</SC> <F>um</F> moved his hands. So I dropped my bag <R>to <F>er</F> rail</R> to <F>er</F> railway. And <F>er</F> <F>well</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>the</SC> <.></.> <F>um</F> because it was <F>um</F> very early in the morning, there were all of <F>um</F> trains <R>com</R> coming in. And <F>well</F> I had no time to jump into <R>rail</R> <F>um</F> railway and <R>pick</R> pick it up. So <?><F>well</F></?> I had a little argument <R>with</R> with the man who dropped <R>my</R> <F>er</F> my bag. <F>Um</F> meanwhile, <F>um</F> <R>sud</R> <F>um</F> suddenly, the train came in. And I thought <F>er</F> <SC>my bag was</SC> <R>bag would be</R> <F>um</F> <.></.> my bag would be broken. <F>Um</F>. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <F>um</F> yes, but, <SC>when the train <R>passed</R> passed away</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>pa</SC> <.></.> when the train moved, I found my bag safe. So, <F>um</F> at the end, I asked the <F>um</F> <R>train</R> train person <SC>and</SC> to pick my back safely. And he <?>resume it</?> <F>um</F> to me <?>safely</?>.Yep. I was lucky.<F>Hm</F>.Traffic accident? <OL><F>Uum</F></OL>.I don't think so. <F>Hm</F> <R>I</R> <F>hm</F> I remember, one day, <F>um</F> at <F>er</F> near Shinjuku.That one man dropped into the railway. And <F>eh</F> two other young men and <F>er</F> a cameraman <F>er</F> helped them. And, <F>well</F> unfortunately, <?>they were</?> <F>um</F> all killed.Yeah.<F>Er</F> in this picture, <F>um</F> the man was talking to <F>er</F> another man. And he didn't recognize that <R>there</R> there was a man <R>behind</R> behind him. <CO>So</CO>. And <F>er</F> he seems to be happy, and, you know, <F>um</F> <R>he</R> <F>er</F> he had a lot of gestures. So <F>um</F> he didn't mean to <F>um</F> drop the man's bag, but it was an accident.<F>Hm</F>.Thank you.<F>Uhu</F>.Yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.Yes. <F>Um</F> I'm going to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> from September.<H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<F>Um</F> as an exchange student.<laughter>So</laughter> I have to write a graduate thesis<SC>before I wen</SC> <F>uh</F> before I go to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.I have to be very <laughter>busy</laughter>with working <R>on</R> <F>er</F> on my graduate thesis.<OL>Study</OL>?<F>Well</F> <F>erm</F> if I have time, I would like to <F>um</F> visit Canada.<CO>Because it's <OL>pretty</OL></CO>.Yeah.<laughter>Thank <OL>you</OL></laughter>.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
