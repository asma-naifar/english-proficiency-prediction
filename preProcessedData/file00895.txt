And it's so difficult, but <R>I</R> I like it.<CO><OL><F>Well</F></OL></CO>.<OL><F>Uhh</F> <F>mmm</F></OL>. <F>Well</F> actually I lived in the Netherlands when I was <R>ch</R> child.And <F>uh</F> Netherlands is <SC>near its Fr</SC> near France. So every vacation <SC>I went to the</SC> I went to France with my family. And I really loved the country.Yes. So I decided to learn French when I was little.

But on Tuesday, I go to my ballet lesson. <OL>Classic ballet</OL>.<laughter>Yes</laughter>. And on Friday, I go to <SC>the par</SC> my part time job. Yes. But it's the usual schedule <OL>for me</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <laughter>O K</laughter>. <F>Well</F>, <SC>I</SC> <R>I'm</R> <SC>I'm not</SC> actually I'm not a good dancer because I just started it <R>from</R> <SC>from this</SC> from January this year. Yes. <SC>I</SC> but <SC>I really wanted to wan</SC> I really wanted to take lessons of ballet from I was little child. But <F>uum</F> I don't know, but my parents didn't allow me to take lessons of ballet.I don't know why. But after I could get the <F>uum</F> <R>per</R> <SC>permissi</SC> entrance permission to Waseda University, <SC>I started to</SC> I could <R>start</R> start to go to the class.Yes.

And <SC>it's</SC> it is refreshing time for me.Yes.O K. This is a <R>cl</R> class room. And the teacher is a woman. She is teaching maybe math. And <SC>they are</SC> there is some students, boys and girls. And <SC><R>some of</R> some of them are doing hard</SC>. No. <R>I</R> I can see only <R>one</R> one. Only one boy are <SC>doing</SC> working hard in front of the teacher. But the other students is not doing good in the classroom. For example, a girl is writing e-mail with her cell phone. And <R>the</R> the other <R>two</R> two girls are <SC>chatting with</SC> yes, <R>ch</R> chatting. And <R>another</R> another men is just <F>uum</F> having bubble gum in <R>his</R> his mouth. And the other boy is listening to the music and drinking. He is drinking the juice or something. And yes. That's all.<F>Well</F> <SC>it's</SC> I think it's completely <R>dif</R> different. I was in the girls' school, and the regulation was very severe. And <R>we</R> we knew that we have to work hard <SC>to</SC> <R>for</R> for the preparation of entrance exams for the university. So <R>we</R> <R>we did</R> yeah, we did work hard during the class, I think.Yes. <CO>And</CO>.<F>Uum</F>. I think it's much similar to <R>this</R> this kind of classroom. Actually I had a class <F>err</F> before <SC>I come to</SC> I came to <R>this</R> this building. <laughter>And</laughter> there are <R>a lot of</R> <R>a lot of students</R> a lot of students. And <SC>the teacher</SC> this professor is <SC>o</SC> the only one person who are talking. And actually <R>I</R> I was like <OL><laughter>this kind of girls in that class</laughter></OL>.<R>Usually</R> usually every week, <SC><R>I</R> I am doing</SC> I try to work hard during the <R>class</R> class. But today that class, I found my closed friend in the classroom. So I chat with her.<F>Uum</F>. It's not good.Yes.O K.<.></.> O K.<F>Well</F> I bought <R>this</R> <R>this one</R> this one. But <R>when I came</R> when I came back home, and I opened the bag <SC>I</SC> actually I didn't <SC>like the</SC> like it.So <R>I</R> <R>I'd like to</R> <F>um</F> I'd like to change this one to the other one.<F>Uum</F>. But <F>well</F> or <R>can I</R> can I get this back, and <R>can</R> can you back the money for me?<F>Uum</F>. But <.></.> <F>well</F> <R>I</R> I can find <SC>the same price</SC> <R>the</R> the goods which is <R>same</R> same price with this. So <R>the</R> <SC>the exchange is</SC> <R>there</R> there's some <SC>some exch</SC> problem of exchanging?<OL>Policy</OL>.<F>Well</F>.<CO>Very</CO>.<CO>Consider about</CO>.<R>Exchange</R> exchange or refund?<F>Oh</F>. Yes. <F>Well</F> <F>uum</F> you know, <SC>this</SC> I bought this <SC>for</SC> suit for the present for my father.<SC>So <R>he</R> he is</SC> <F>uum</F> so I don't want him to be disappointed this time. So I <F>well</F> really want to <SC>buy the</SC> buy something which really please him.So I think this one is not suitable for this occasion. <CO>So</CO>.I think <F>um</F> that one is much better for me. And <SC>the same pri</SC> it's a same price. So <R>can I</R> <R>can I</R> can I make it?<OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Err</F>.Thank you.<OL><F>Oh</F> thank you very much</OL>.<OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.<F>Uum</F>. <F>Well</F> no.No, I don't, <OL>I think</OL>.<F>Well</F> I think, yes, when I have a experience when I bought something and go back, <SC>I</SC> but I didn't like the stuff which I bought. But <SC>I gave up to</SC> <R>I</R> I gave up changing or something because it was the thing which I decided to buy at the store.
