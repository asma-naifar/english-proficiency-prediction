Hello.
My name is .
Yes, please.
 pretty good, thank you.
Typical Tuesday? Tuesday is the toughest day for me because I have lots of hard classes.
For example, I have a morning class from nine o'clock. And I have two of the toughest classes in a week in this Tuesday morning. and I have classes from nine o'clock and to fifth periods. So it takes until before six o'clock.
So Tuesday is the hardest day for me. .
 my favorite classes. . I like learning language. it's so difficult, but I like French class.
I've just started learning French from this April. And it's so difficult, but I like it.
.
 actually I lived in the Netherlands when I was child.
And Netherlands is near France. So every vacation I went to France with my family. And I really loved the country.
Yes. So I decided to learn French when I was little. And then I could start from this April.
 usually I go back home, and have a supper with my family. But on Tuesday, I go to my ballet lesson. .
. And on Friday, I go to my part time job. Yes. But it's the usual schedule .
. , actually I'm not a good dancer because I just started it from January this year. Yes. but I really wanted to take lessons of ballet from I was little child. But I don't know, but my parents didn't allow me to take lessons of ballet.
I don't know why. But after I could get the entrance permission to Waseda University, I could start to go to the class.
Yes. And it's class for adults. So yes, it's not too hard.
But it's really fun.
 . I don't know, but when I'm doing ballet
what do I feel? .
I feel I don't know, very openly.
. And it is refreshing time for me.
Yes.
O K. This is a class room. And the teacher is a woman. She is teaching maybe math. And there is some students, boys and girls. And some of them are doing hard I can see only one. Only one boy are working hard in front of the teacher. But the other students is not doing good in the classroom. For example, a girl is writing e-mail with her cell phone. And the other two girls are yes, chatting. And another men is just having bubble gum in his mouth. And the other boy is listening to the music and drinking. He is drinking the juice or something. And yes. That's all.
 I think it's completely different. I was in the girls' school, and the regulation was very severe. And we knew that we have to work hard for the preparation of entrance exams for the university. So yeah, we did work hard during the class, I think.
Yes. .
. I think it's much similar to this kind of classroom. Actually I had a class before I came to this building. there are a lot of students. And this professor is the only one person who are talking. And actually I was like .
 usually every week, I am doing class. But today that class, I found my closed friend in the classroom. So I chat with her.
. It's not good.
Yes.
O K.
 O K.
 I bought this one. But when I came back home, and I opened the bag actually I didn't like it.
So I'd like to change this one to the other one.
. But or can I get this back, and can you back the money for me?
. But I can find the goods which is same price with this. So there's some problem of exchanging?
.
.
.
.
 exchange or refund?
. Yes. you know, I bought this suit for the present for my father.
 he is so I don't want him to be disappointed this time. So I really want to buy something which really please him.
So I think this one is not suitable for this occasion. .
I think that one is much better for me. And it's a same price. So can I make it?
.
.
Thank you.
 thank you very much.
.
. no.
No, I don't, .
 I think, yes, when I have a experience when I bought something and go back, but I didn't like the stuff which I bought. But I gave up changing or something because it was the thing which I decided to buy at the store. So I gave up.
O K. . and he could see coming from the man coming on the bike. And he was talking with the cell phone. And he was talking with her girlfriend. And when they passed by, they crashed. And the man on the bike throw his cell phone . And his bike and his cell phone was broken. And they were started to argue each other. And then the policeman came. And .
 the guy on the bike was angry because his bike is broken. But the man who was on the car was insisted that it was because of the guy on the bike because he was the man who was talking with cell phone when he riding a bike. Then the trucking and the bike was carried away.
 when it is not too big accident, we gonna talk each other. And we will exchange our address or telephone number or something. But you know, yeah, when it was a big accident, we call the police, and yes, we call the police.
O K.
 yes.
 I won't because I don't have a you know, sports class.
So we have no usual class on that day.
So I'm going to go to the driving school.
.
. Yes.
