<F>Uh</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<F>Huh</F> yes, I'm fine. But I have a little bit stomachache.<F>Ah</F> maybe <F>um</F> it always happen when I have a test.<OL>So</OL> I'm a little bit nervous.<laughter>Thank you</laughter>.<R>My hobby</R> <F>er</F> my hobby is to listen to the music.And I especially like rock music and techno music.For example, I like <F>um</F> <.></.> a band of Queen,and <F>uh</F> Pierrot, <?>Durham Gray</?>. <F>Ah</F> why I like these bands, <F>hm</F> because <F>uh</F> <.></.> <SC>they</SC> their music are very emotional. So when I hear their music, my heart are very beating and moving.<F>Hum</F> <F>hum</F> every music of <?>their</?> very nice,<OL>but</OL> I like <F>um</F> "Bohemian Rhapsody" of Queen is best.Because <F>um</F> the voice are <R>very</R> very cute and moving for me.<F>Ah</F> yes.Yes. I work as a support member of a extension center,<OL>of this</OL> college.<F>Er</F> my work is to support classes.For example, I make <F>um</F> prints or textbooks for class. And sometimes I help the students of the classes, like <F>um</F> giving some prints of last lessons or <F>um</F> take care of them.<F>Um</F> it is very exciting to <.></.> meet a lot of people and <F>hm</F> I can learn a lot of things from the textbooks <.></.> I make.<F>Hm</F>. <R>A lot</R> a lot of kind. For example, English books,business books or sometimes culture books like literature.I also make a Japanese literature book. It is very fun for me to read the textbook.<F>Hum</F> I also reading books or sometimes, <nvs>sneeze</nvs> excuse me, <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>er</F> I'm very fond of sleeping.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL> my favorite is <F>ah</F> mystery book.For example, I like <F>um</F> Edogawa Rampo's book,because his books are so fantastic and mysterious.Yes.Yes. The teacher, she is very hard to teach the students mathematics but the class member are very rude. <.></.> <F>Hm</F> except one student, they are doing their <R>fav</R> <F>um</F> their <.></.> favorite things. For example, <nvs>sniff</nvs> this man, he is chewing a gum. And <SC>these ladies are very</SC> <?>yeah</?>, these very fond of chatting. So they didn't hear the lesson. And this man is very, very <R?>tied</R?> <?>tied</?> because he is listening music and drinking a water. So <SC>sh</SC> he didn't listen to her lesson. And this lady is drink something with her mobile phone. So she also <SC>don't</SC> <F>mm</F> doesn't listen to her. <SC>Especially</SC> but he is the one who is listening to her lesson very carefully.Almost <?>look</?> the same.Because <F>ah</F> when I was a high school student, we have to study for the exam of university. So half of us are very, very busy to <F>ur</F> study about <JP>juku</JP> homework.And about <.></.> other half are very, very busy,to speak or play with other students,so they didn't <.></.> listen to the lesson.Me, too. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I was very busy to speak with my friends.And sometimes we are scolded because we are <SC>too cro</SC> <F>uu</F> too noisy.The teacher said to me, "If you want to speak with your friends, <laughter>get out</laughter>.".I was very surprised, so <.></.> I was keep silent since then.Yes.Yes.<F>Ah</F> yes. I have to go New York,<OL>as soon as</OL> <F>ah</F> possible.So <F>ah</F> which train to take is the best?<F>Um</F> when is <SC>the near</SC> the soonest? Because I have to go as soon as I can.<F>Mm</F> <.></.> I don't mind about the cost, <OL>so</OL>.<R>please</R> please tell me the <.></.> fastest train.<F>Ah</F> now, I want to take the express train,so <F>hm</F> I want to buy a ticket of it.<F>Oh</F>.<F>Um</F> but is it the most fastest?O K. I'll wait. So I want to buy a ticket of it. So where can I buy it?<F>Oh</F>. I want to buy it.<R>How</R> how much?<F>Oh</F> one thousand yen. O K. Here's one thousand yen.<OL><F>Oh</F> thank</OL> you very much.<F>Uh</F> thank you <OL>very much</OL>.<F>Um</F> <R>I didn't</R> I didn't decided to go. Because <F>er</F> almost all of my friends are study for their examination of university. Because they couldn't pass the exam last year.So I can't say to them, "Hey, play with somewhere.". <nvs>laughter</nvs>So <F>um</F> maybe this year, I will spend the time with my family.<F>Mm</F> maybe I will make a cake,and eat them with my family.<F>Uhm</F> last year, I learned how to make a <JP>shokora</JP> cake, so I want to make it.<.></.> And <F>um</F> <.></.> I am belong to a music circle. But the members of it are very busy.So maybe we can't do <.></.> <R>any</R> any play.Yes.<nvs>sneeze</nvs><JP><F>Eeto</F></JP> <F>uh</F>. O K. One day last week, a boy and <F>er</F> his girlfriend <SC>walking on the s</SC> <F>ah</F> walked on the street. It was very raining day. They were very happy to speak with each other. Suddenly, he heard <F>eh</F> some voice. He said, "<CO><SC>Loo</SC> <F>mm</F> <R>he</R> <?>hear</?></CO>. There is some voice.". <.></.> She was surprised to hear that. Then, she found a cat in a box. She was <R>very</R> <.></.> very happy to found it and <.></.> she hold it. But the house is not allowed to <.></.> keep pets. So he said, "No. We can't take it to home.". She was very shocked to hear that. But she knew that if she said, "<SC>I want to take it to her</SC> I want to take her home.". <.></.> So he was very, very <F>mm</F> nervous but finally, he was allowed to take her home. <.></.> So <nvs>cough</nvs> <.></.> she put her in the box again and hold the box. And <F>ah</F> she couldn't <.></.> take the umbrella herself so <.></.> he used the umbrella for her and the box. And they went home.<F>Ah</F> I want to take it to my home. But I keep a dog in my house. So <F>hm</F> I was nervous if they are fighting. Because dogs and cats are not so friendly each other. My dog's bark <R>when</R> <SC>when she say</SC> <F>em</F> <SC>we</SC> when she saw a cat on the road.So it is <R>very</R> <.></.> very <F>hmm</F> hurting for me. But <SC>I could</SC> I can't take her home.<OL>Yes</OL>.I will go and eat some lunch.Because <.></.> <SC>I hu</SC> <F>er</F> I am a hungry.I will eat some sandwich my mother made for me.Yes.Thank you very much.I hope you, too.
