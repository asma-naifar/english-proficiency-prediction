Favorite teacher. .  In high school?
 I like  history teacher.   she was very kind and very nice and  her way of  teach was very clearly and easy to understand.   she told me  if you want to study history you should always think  why    did it do that. .
 it was very interesting.
 I don't remember her age.   she was  a bit chubby.
   she  had  short hair. But she was always smiling.

Good. Let's meet there at two P M.
See you. .
Yes.
. I like.
 recently I don't have much time to see a movie  at home.
But  several years ago,  I like to see a movie
in my house.
  I like to see an action movie in the theater. Because there has a good    effective  sound.  and  there are big screen in front of us, so and  if I see a thrilling movie or action movie,   it's more fun than see a movie  at home.

O K.   my friends   like cooking. And one day she thought   she want to make something. And  she is  searching food  in a refrigerator.  but  nothing in a refrigerator. So she was going to the store by her car. And     she got some groceries in a supermarket. And    she paid them. And   she put many grocery in the trunk in  her car. And then she could cook .

 I don't like  because  I live  with my family, so my mother likes cooking.
So and she doesn't want me to use kitchen.   I don't need to cook. 
. She likes Japanese food, so   she doesn't like oily food so she makes healthy food always. 

After this,  . So  I will go straight home, and have a dinner and take a bath   laterly.

O K.
Thank you.
