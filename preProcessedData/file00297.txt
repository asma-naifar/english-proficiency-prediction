Start with this?
. One day last week,   Ken and Ai were walking in a street.    it was raining the day. And     Ken find the noise from the box.   and  they tried to open the box. And there's a cute cat. And  I forgot the name,     Maki found the cat and   try to get out of the box.    and she   wanted      to take the cat to  her house. But Ken didn't like  because he has  cat allergy.  But  he loves her so     what she wanted to do so       he understand to take the cat to their home.  
.
Yes. Yes.   now I have a dog and he's  five month old.
 Very   small  child dog.
 because  we have another dog  but  he died  four years ago.
And when   I    using  internet, I found  the dog very similar dog that we had   four years ago. So  I  check the name of the dog. And   the dog is bearded collie. So we didn't know about the bearded collie so,  we send a e-mail to breeder. There is a breeder list in a   internet. So I send a  e-mail to   one of breeder   so,  he send me a e-mail that his dog had a baby. So   I went to  his house, and check the cute babies.  Then we decided to have  dog.
He's very cute. 
 he has a   long hair. But now he is a  baby so the hair is very short.
And then the color is black and white.   and  when  he became a  adult, he has very long hair and the body is very big, about  twenty-seven kilograms.
Now,  he has already  seventeen kilograms.
. .
 Very big. Very heavy. . It's  very difficult to hug him. .
   .
We call him .
  we try to call him in  several names, and     he came to us  when we call him . So maybe we thought  he like the name.
  easy to decide the name.
.
