My name is .
 so-so. That is because I'm very sleepy now. 
Last night, I had some assignment to do.
 so I couldn't sleep well.
 report
to hand in professor about 
morality and education. The title was "Morality and Education".


Briefly? It is difficult. yes, now for children,
 it is difficult to teach what is morality.
 but teachers force them to obey some rule they made.
But I think it is not suitable for children. I think it is the best way to let them think, let them, children, what is good and what is bad by themselves.
And so I think it is the best way to let them make their rules by their thinking. .
.

I major in English literature.
. I'm sorry?
Now?
 to tell the truth, I want to read some books I want to read, but now,
 I have some books I have to read.
The book is about Shakespeare.
And the Elizabeth era's drama about such kind of books to write some report for the test.
 best play is "Hamlet". 
, difficult.
So I'm interested in.

 live in Prefecture.
 of course by train. It takes one and half an hour.
And firstly to come here,
 I use Line.
And at Station, I change the train to Line.
 and by Line, I go to Station.
And at Station, I change the train to Line.
And I come here. 

Yes. . I live with my family, my parents,
my father and my mother and a dog named Annie.
 for four years.
 when I'm free, it depends. But recently, if I have 
enough time, I go to see a movie or yes, I go out with my friends.
. But I don't have so enough time
because I'm very busy because I have part-time job at cram school.
So if I find sometime, I spend a time to read some books.
 in a sense, I enjoy. But it is very difficult to teach. I teach junior high and elementary school student
but it is difficult to make them understand.
.
And make them concentrate on what they are doing is difficult, .

Yes.
Yes. this picture is a girl's room.
. And in the room, a girl is sitting at her desk. And personal computer and the printer. And in the room, there is another materials, for example, her bed. And on the bed, there is a cat and aside the bed, there is a dog.
 I can't see the dog's face. and cat is sleeping.
 and audio system. and under the audio system, there is a phone. and under the phone, there are some books.
 now the time is nine o'clock. but it seems not so dark from the window, so maybe now is morning, I think.
Yes. . And I think what she is doing. maybe she has to finish some report
and from now on, she will be go to school with that report. And beside her, there is a dash box and in the box, there are some paper. So she must have write over and over again, .

 not so different. I think it's very similar to my room.
I have also personal computer system on my desk. but I don't have bed. I use futon.
So in this sense, it is different. 
Yes.
 .
 can I use "she"? 
 she is poodle. Do you know poodle?
. But it is different from other poodle for me.
 I don't cut her hair in the style of usual poodle cut.
 my mother cut my dog, Annie. she is very good at cutting. 
So she is very pretty. 
Like sheep.
O K.
Hello. 
I'm .
Yes. thank you for inviting me to the party. but I have to say I'm sorry to you.
That is because I can't go to your party. But yes, really if you have another party, in near future, could you invite me?

Yes. Of course. I come.
Yes. And I also like to invite my friends to my house.
 the last party? the last party

. O K. One day last week, a friend of mine, her name is Jullie, Jullie called me. And she invited me to go for some place 
for a dating. And I agreed. And we decided to go to the zoo. . And pick her up to the zoo. And we got to the zoo, we enter the zoo. And firstly, we come to the prison of lion and it looks very fearful. she feared, so I told her, "Don't worry. The lion is in prison, so we are safe. So don't worry.". And nextly, we went to the prison of monkey that was eating banana. And it was very pretty. And she looked pleased with looking at the monkey. and then, we go around in the zoo and looked any other animals and it was very enjoyable for us.
.
 there are many places I want to take them.
 but one of that is Edo Tokyo Museum. Do you know?
 in Ryogoku.
 and in that museum, we can see many kinds of materials that shows Japanese culture.
 I have taken
