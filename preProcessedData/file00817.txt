Good evening.
My name is .
Yes. .
Yes, of course.
I live in Kawagoe in Saitama Prefecture. .
. I should ride Tobu Tojo Line from Kawagoe to Ikebukuro and I change the train to Yamanote Line,
and at Takadanobaba, finally I change Tozai Line,
 I come here.
I work in Nihonbashi near Mitsukoshi Department Store.
Yeah.
 I hate it because it's too crowded, too many people, and, yeah, trains sometimes move very rough.
Yeah, so even in the morning, I'm always tired. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Of course, . But everybody look for seats,
so it's kind of battle .
. Yes, of course, the seat in front of me somebody the get off the train,
of course, I sit down there,
but there are a little bit far from me to the seat,
it's very difficult to .
.
.
 I work at the bank. I work for account
for foreign banks.
. Yeah, sometimes I like it very much, but sometimes I'm boring.
.
Yeah, sometimes we should send some telegram to other foreign banks.
I like it very much because I need to think some sentences in English. I like it very much. . But other part, I have to do same things everyday.
Yes.
Job .
Yeah.
 . Every Saturday, I teach Japanese to foreigners.
. it's a volunteer class.
I like it very much. .
Yeah. . There are many kind of foreigners,
 Canadian, Switzerlander and Spanish or English and .
. They are very good persons. I like them very much, and I really enjoy teaching Japanese.
Yeah. . Because there are some reasons.
At first, I learned Japanese literature and Japanese language at my university,
so I'm very interested in Japanese. And second, my English teacher when I was a high school, she was a American. And she said, "Japanese is very difficult language.".
So, yeah, she went to some Japanese school, but there are only Asian people, so she always felt was so difficult for Western people and the grammar was very far from English grammars.
So she felt very sad every time in the school.
I heard that story, so I wanted to try to teach Japanese.
Yeah.
You're welcome.
Yeah.
Yes. . it's a sunny morning and people live there are very comfortable to talk each other or reading newspapers. And childrens playing with ball or rope.
. And, of course, dogs and cat look very comfortable with their master.
.
Yes.
.
Yeah.
.
Yes.
Yeah. . Yeah, the biggest difference is there are gar wide garden around house. But in Kawagoe, we have only small garden or small room around houses.
. That's the biggest difference. And, yeah, in Japan, there are fence around houses.
But there are no fences. . Yeah, and there are no border between neighbor.

Yeah.
