I used to live in England before.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>. Yeah.So I really didn't want to come to a school in Japan but then I got used to it. <??></??> There's lots of people who are very kind and who are <?>very</?> same situation as I am in. Soand they understand me and I understand them. So I think that's a really good thing about this school.So I like it quite a lot.Yes. <F>Um</F> <F>well</F> <F>um</F> I used to live in a place <SC>called</SC> near <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> which is right north of England. And <F>er</F> I used to go to a <?>private</?> girls' schools so<OL><??></??></OL>. Yeah. It was a private school.And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>um</F> <?>don't know what to say</?>, <R>but</R> but the teachers were really, <F>um</F> <F>um</F> they were very friendly and <SC>there was a</SC> there was lots of communication traction between the students and the teachers all the time.We had small classes. So like, each child got <F>um</F> the maximum attention that she could get from the teacherwhich was very good, because like all of us are at different stage and we're not all at the same level. So that was very good.<F>Um</F> about nearly seven years.I think I was eight <?>in</?> <OL><??></??> eight</OL>.Like second year in primary school.<F>Well</F> <F>um</F> I have two brothers, an elder brother and a younger brother.My my eldest brother goes to a university.

You know, we hang out.And we go shopping or we go watch a film<OL>in</OL> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. We go <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> a lot.Because it's closer to school. We all have our <F>um</F> commuter <OL>passes</OL>,<laughter>so</laughter> like we don't have to pays for <R>the</R> <F>um</F> the transporting fees.So we go to <OL><H pn="others2">XXX04</H></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<nvs>sigh</nvs> <F>Er</F> <F>well</F> there's lots to do in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, I guess. There's lots of shops for <OL>shopping</OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>. So <SC>you can</SC> there's lots of <F>er</F> cinemas so you can watch lots of them. You know, some places they only like show,you know, particular number of films but there's lots of cinemas in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> soyou have a wide choice. Yes. And also I guess <F>hm</F> I don't know. We <laughter>go to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> a lot</laughter> for those reasons, I guess.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.Yes. There are a lot of girls the same age as us. There's even like <F>um</F> primary school students or like about my <SC>st</SC> <F>um</F> small brother's age.You know, little <laughter>children</laughter>in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. And sometimes it just feels like kind of dangerous for them because<OL>there's</OL> lots of <OL>different</OL> people there and<?>you know</?> not everybody there <?>the adults are</?>, yeah,good people.There's been lots of incidents there.We've heard lots of things <?>about</?>.O K. <F>Um</F> this is scene in a classroom. And the teacher is <F>um</F> doing a math lesson. And <SC>the students</SC> <F>well</F> the student at the front is studying but some of the students are playing with their mobile phones, talking to each other, drinking, and some of them are sleeping. And that's it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh</F> <OL>in <SC><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></SC> yeah</OL>.<F>Um</F> <F>well</F> first of all, <F>well</F> <laughter>there are no boys</laughter>, obviouslyin our school. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> we weren't allowed to talk in class. So we were not allowed to drink or play with our mobile phones. We weren't allowed to carry mobile phones into our school. So and the desks were arranged in a more semi-circular way, so <SC>we were</SC> like we were surrounding the teacher.Yeah. That's basically the differences.<F>Um</F> <F>well</F> at first, yes. <CO>And I was the only Asian in the, yeah, our school, so</CO>.Yes.So everybody was, you know, typical white people. So they have some, you know, prejudice or something. <SC>They</SC> it was hard for some of them to accept me and it was hard for me to accept them. So like they sometimes called me Chinese and they started making faces. So that I was very hurt like that. But then, you know, we grew up together, so <SC>it wasn't</SC> <F>um</F> at first, those kind of things happen. But then like we got used to each other being different.So, I guess, I didn't experience any other kind of <?>harms</?> with them.O K.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.O K.Hi, <R>this</R> this is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.Yes. <F>Um</F> I'm very sorry, but <F>well</F> I had a car break<OL>on the way</OL> and I don't think I can go to your party today.<F>Well</F> I was on the way to house and <SC>I s</SC> we stopped and my car broke down. <SC>So</SC> <F>um</F> but we couldn't get it to work any more.And we had to carry the car to a nearby <F>er</F> garage.
