Good afternoon.Yes. I am <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.I'm very fine, thank you. And you?Typical day?<F>Mm</F> <F>er</F>. How I spend <OL>my weekend</OL>?<F>Oh</F>. On weekdays? <F>Erm</F>. I've just <F>erm</F> moved to a new department from February. And <R>I</R> I normally come to the office around ten o'clock and stay until midnight.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>. So, <F>erm</F> mainly, I spend most of my time in meetings. <SC>And</SC> <F>erm</F> so I have relatively <F>er</F> <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> five to six meetings per day.Yes. After that, I do my <R>normal</R> normal work <OL>at my desk</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I want to ask that as well to my boss. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>But <F>erm</F> we have a very <SC>good</SC> <F>er</F> strong relationship with our <SC>agency</SC> advertising agency. And we tend to share a lot of information together, and not only by mail, but also meeting each other. We think that we can strengthen our relationship.<F>Erm</F>. In my free time, <F>erm</F> if I'm in the country, <F>erm</F> <SC>I would like</SC> I like shopping, <F>erm</F> spending time with my friends, watching movies. And, if I can have <SC>time</SC> enough time to go abroad,<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> I like traveling especially to southern islands.Yes, like Asian countries.<F>Erm</F>. I went to Cebu in the Philippines. <F>Erm</F>. I pretty enjoyed. I used to live in England when I was very small. And I <F>er</F> traveled a lot of places in Europe. But, these day, I tend to visit Asian countries and also <F>erm</F> to the States as well.<F>Erm</F>. I have many friends <R>in</R> <R>in</R> in other countries, and I visit <F>er</F> them.<F>Erm</F>. I have friends in the Philippians, and also in Thailand, Singapore.<F>Erm</F>. In <?><H pn="company name1">XXX03</H></?>, there are many international training courses. And <F>erm</F> I met those <F>er</F> friends <R>in</R> in that courses.Yes, it's very interesting.<F>Oh</F> <F>erm</F>. This, I would like to go there. <nvs>laughter</nvs> This is a ski resort, and <F>erm</F> many <SC>per</SC> people enjoying <F>er</F> skiing and also <.></.> making snowballs, throwing snowballs. <CO>And <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> somebody is <SC>falling down</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> falling off the, how do you say</CO>. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> And some couples are skiing very good. And also, there is a lodge near <R>the</R> the place. And some couples are having coffee together. <.></.> It's very fine day. <.></.> Anything else?<F>Erm</F> sports. <.></.> Other than resorts.<F>Umm</F>. <R>I</R> <.></.> I like beach rather than <F>er</F> these <R>winter</R> <SC>winter sports</SC> winter resorts. So <F>erm</F> that kind of sport is one of my favorite places. <.></.> And, <F>erm</F> <.></.> since I spent most of my time working <F>er</F> in this <F>er</F> center of the city, <F>er</F> I would rather like to go out to a relaxing place with <R>a lot</R> a lot of green, <F>erm</F> quiet place.<F>Erm</F> <R>I</R> I just only had chance to watch the news <SC>when I</SC> <F>erm</F> after getting back to home. So <F>erm</F> I watch the <.></.> short track, <F>er</F> the skating race and also <R>the</R> the "ski dance". <laughter>I don't know</laughter>. <F>Umm</F>. <.></.>Ski. <F>Oh</F>. Sorry, sorry. <F>Er</F>. <R>Skating</R> skating dance.<F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <R>I</R> I realize that <F>er</F> there was <R>sad</R> sad situation for the Russian couples <R>who</R> <SC>who supposed to</SC> <R>who</R> who first of all won the gold prize. And, <F>erm</F> basically, <SC>Olympic is supposed to be a very</SC> <F>erm</F> <F>mm</F> <.></.> <R>it</R> it should be run by justice. <F>Ur</F>. So <F>erm</F> I thought <F>erm</F> it's a very sad thing to happen. <.></.> But <F>erm</F> <SC>I think both the</SC> I think it was the Canadian or <SC>the</SC> from the States, <F>erm</F> <SC>was al</SC> did also well. And also, the Russian couple, <R>the</R> <SC>the</SC> their <.></.> demonstration was <SC>very</SC> also very nice.Yes.Yes.<F>Mm-hm</F>.Yes. <.></.> Excuse me.<OL><F>Erm</F></OL>. I bought this clothes <F>er</F> the other day. But <F>erm</F> it didn't really fit to my size. So, would it be possible for me to exchange it to the other size?<.></.> <OL><F>Er</F></OL>.<OL>When I buy</OL>? <F>Er</F>. <.></.> <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I did. <.></.> But <F>erm</F> it really didn't match me after getting back home when I <SC>try it</SC> tried it again. So <F>erm</F> <F>er</F> it's only yesterday that I bought. So I was thinking whether <F>erm</F> it's possible <R>to</R> to change it to the other type.Yes, I have this <OL>with me</OL>.<F>Erm</F>. <.></.> I see. <F>Mmm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Too bad. <R>Any</R> <SC>any possibility</SC> any other chances for me to <OL>exchange</OL>?<F>Oh</F> then, I'll pay the gap.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>. Because I don't like this <.></.> type. And <F>erm</F> even though I keep it, I will not wear it. So I'd rather pay the gap.<F>Umm</F>.By the way, how much is the gap?<.></.> O K. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Trouble?<F>Erm</F>. Yes. When I visited Spain, I bought this leather jacket. And <F>erm</F> it was very nice, and it was <R>a</R> a shop close to my hotel. And, after coming back to the hotel, I noticed that this <F>erm</F> <.></.> security tag still on. And <SC>I don't</SC> <SC>I did</SC> I don't know why <SC>it didn't</SC> the bell didn't ring when I left the shop. So I went back <SC>and</SC> <F>erm</F> <R>to</R> to exchange it. But then, I was asked to show them my passport. In Spain, they require <R>to</R> to show the passport in any occasions. And I didn't carry my passport. So I had to go back to the hotel again. And then, came back in the third time, <SC>I wa</SC> I manage to change it and also let them take off the tag. They didn't apologize <SC>as</SC> at all. So I was very disappointed. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><..></..> <F>Erm</F>. Then, explain?<F>Uh</F>. Yeah. One day last week, <F>er</F> there was a man who's driving on the street. And then, <R>from the other</R> <F>er</F> from the other side, there was a guy <F>er</F> riding a bike <F>er</F> and also talking <R>on</R> on his mobile phone. Probably, it was his girlfriend. And then, <F>erm</F> <SC>that car</SC> <SC>the man</SC> <F>erm</F> <..></..> <F>er</F> when <R>the</R> the driver <F>er</F> tried to turn to the left, <R>this</R> <F>er</F> this guy who was riding the bike, he dropped his mobile phone. And that mobile phone hit to the car. <..></..> And <SC>also the</SC> the bike also <F>er</F> bumped into the car. And then, <F>erm</F> this guy who was riding the bike tried to complain to the driver. And <SC>he was trying</SC> he was showing his damage to bike. And then, <SC>the driver</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>so proba</SC> <F>erm</F> the driver, I think, <F>ur</F> called the police <R>to</R> <R>to</R> <F>erm</F> <.></.> to <R>help</R> help them out. And then, the driver tried to explain that since the mobile <R>phone</R> phone hit the car, <R>the</R> the driver tried to <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> avoid hitting. But, in fact, <F>erm</F> in the end, <R>they</R> they hit. <.></.> And, in the last, <F>ur</F> <.></.> <R>the</R> <SC>the bike had to be</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <F>erm</F> <JP>naosu-tte-nante</JP>, <R>it was carried to</R> it was carried to <F>erm</F> <.></.> be amended? <nvs>laughter</nvs>In the train?If it's very short, I don't mind. But, if it starts <R>to</R> to become very long, I'll start being bothered <.></.> because, <F>er</F> normally, <F>er</F> <SC>the train</SC> <R>in</R> in the train in Japan, is very quiet. And <F>er</F> people tend <R>to</R> to talk in a quiet voice. And also not only the mobile phone, but people who are <SC>listening on</SC> listening <SC>the</SC> their M D <F>er</F> and also the C D player on the train, and even they use the earphone, the sound will come out. And that is sometimes bothering.After this interview, I have a meeting <OL><laughter>with the agency</laughter></OL>.<F>Er</F>. Fortunately, I have <F>er</F> one<OL>only</OL> left.<OL>So</OL> I left the office yesterday in midnight. So, today, I plan to leave much much earlier. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL>Thank you very much</OL>, indeed.
