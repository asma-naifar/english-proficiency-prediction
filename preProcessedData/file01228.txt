.
 my name is .
.
Yeah.
 Thank you.
 my mom.
 when I ask her, she said it fits my face but I don't know.
I'm in the second year.
 I'm in football club.
And it's O K here .
 strict
it's not really strict.
 clothes and.
Clothes.
Right.
 like other schools, like they maybe strict to uniforms. But here, even if you come in your own clothes, though they do care but they don't really say much.
Because when I was in Germany,
 
and school was interesting.
I could get into here just by writing essays .
And I was in England.
I lived in England for about five years.
 I got used to English by like playing football.
Because that's the only thing I could do. I could only say like, "Yes" or "No".
 like by enjoying school life there,
 to it .
 and I could speak just 
normal, daily-life
English
 in about a year.
Can't compare, but I think I prefer Germany.
Because it's cleaner
and maybe it fits me.
 I did like England but maybe I thought Germany fit better.
 mainly food.
In England, just like food is like I wouldn't say delicious, but in Germany but there are like many food, not horrible.
 maybe it was more free than.
Like here, it's like everyday there's something to do. So it's busy and like all the studies.
I did study there but 
not the schedules aren't bad as here.

Yeah.
.
 looks like a math class
with a student who is concentrating on work but there are some people who are playing around,
listening to music.
 this class looks like .
Yeah.
Maybe.
 looks it's more free. the teacher seems doesn't care .
. . 
Not exactly but .
Because I think that in Japan, the teachers don't really care about students like that during class. Some teachers do but mostly.
In England or Germany,
 all joined in. And we all talk together.
And it's more free but everyone's concentrating on this lesson
 teacher makes it interesting,
.
The most impressive?

Maybe history 
 music or history.
It was like they made me 
compose music.
So .
Like the teacher was like really good in music.
And it was just three people in a class, so 
like if you like music a lot, it's very interesting class, 
you learn about music in whole world and like get to know many instruments of the .
O K.
O K.
.
 I bought this stuff and I brought to back home but I didn't really like it. So
 could you exchange it back to my money?
But I've already bought it just .
But I never really opened it .
So.
 I bought a book.
But
.
 I've already decided my mind to buy it so it was I never really bothered to check it. .
O K. 
 exchange it with the same book or.

 I was in a hurry. And it was present for my mom.
And I didn't really have the time for the party. .
O K.
.
.
.
 not really.
Yeah.
.
Clerk.
 where?
 I think in Japan, it's more kind.
But maybe too kind.
Because whenever I like go into like clothes shops, it's like they just go over to me and ask me like "What size would you like?". "If you want to try out for that?". But over there, it's like you can just 
They don't really talk to you.
Except when you ask something about I think shop over there .
So make the conversation?
 a man called John was driving down the road.
There was another man called Paul
 riding on his bike, talking to his girlfriend.
Then suddenly the two crashed. And Paul's phone dropped on the road. And it broke. And Paul said to John that it's his fault phone broke.
 and then police comes.
 but John says that he shouldn't be talking on the phone while driving.
And then finally, 
 bike got taken over
and ended happy.
 the driving on the car .
 he's talking on the phone.
From picture it looks like the car crashing with the bike, so
maybe the car could have been more careful.
 talking on the cell phone?
.
 yeah.
 E-mail.
Maybe writing E-mails are a lot cheaper.
And maybe you can just talk when you are free. On the phone,
it cost more.
 both of them have to be, like you know, free in time to talk .
But E-mails are like you can back reply when you have time.

 like if you talk to friends in schools, maybe I just E-mails but if you don't meet that someone a lot, you don't talk to he or her 
maybe phone is better.
 but he's like far away, maybe E-mails.
 I might just go to club but
if I don't, I just go back home and study
because, yeah.
Math.
 next .
.
I don't think I'm that good but I don't think it's bad maybe.
.
 O K.
Thank you.
