<OL>Afternoon</OL>.<F>Um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL>Right</OL>.Yeah.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Thank you.<OL>I think it's</OL> my mom.<F>Er</F> when I ask her, she said it fits my face but I don't know.I'm in the second year.<F>Er</F> I'm in football club.And <laughter><F>Er</F></laughter> <??></??> <R>it's</R> it's O K here <??></??>.<SC?>It's that</SC?> <SC>it's not <R>st</R> strict</SC>it's not really strict.<CO>Like <??></??> <.></.> <F>um</F> clothes and</CO>.Clothes.Right.<R>Like</R> like other schools, <SC>they may</SC> like they maybe strict to uniforms. But here, even if you come in your own clothes, though they do care but they don't really say much.Because when I was in Germany,<OL><SC>I</SC></OL> my mom's friend found this school and I looked at the <??></??> <?>Internet</?>and <??></??> school was interesting.I could get into here just by writing essays <??></??>.And I was in England.I lived <R?>in</R?> in England for about five years.<F>Um</F> <F>er</F> I got used to English by like <SC>playing</SC> <R>play</R> playing football.Because that's the only thing I could do. I could only say like, "Yes" or "No".<F>Um</F> like by enjoying school life there,<OL>I got used</OL> to it <?>then</?>.<F>Um</F> and I could speak just <R>normal</R>normal, daily-lifeEnglish<R>i</R> in about a year.Can't compare, but I think I prefer Germany.Because it's cleanerand maybe it fits me.<??></??> I did like England but maybe I thought Germany fit better.<??></??> mainly food.In England, just like food is like I wouldn't say delicious, but in Germany but there are like many food, <F>um</F> not horrible.<CO><SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> maybe it was more free than</CO>.Like here, it's like everyday there's something to do. So it's busy and like all the studies.I did study there but <OL>I did</OL>not the schedules aren't bad as here.<??></??>Yeah.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Er</F> looks like a math classwith a student who is concentrating on work but there are some people who are playing around,listening to music.<F>Um</F> this class looks like <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H>.Yeah.Maybe.<F>Er</F> looks it's more free. <F>Er</F> <F>um</F> the teacher seems doesn't care <OL>really</OL>.<CO>It's</CO>. <F>Um</F>. <??></??>Not exactly but <OL>kind of</OL>.Because I think that in Japan, the teachers don't really care about students like that during class. Some teachers do but mostly.In England or Germany,<OL>like</OL> all joined in. And we all talk together.And <SC>it's more</SC> <R>it's mo</R> it's more free but <SC>all</SC> everyone's concentrating on this lesson<OL>because <SC>it's</SC></OL> teacher makes it interesting,<OL>I think</OL>.The most impressive?<OL><F>Er</F></OL>. <..></..>Maybe history <OL>or</OL><OL><R>mu</R></OL> music or history.It was like they made me <OL><F>er</F></OL>compose music.So <laughter><??></??></laughter>.Like the teacher was like really good in music.And it was just three people in a class, so <SC>we <OL>could do</OL></SC>like if you like music a lot, it's very interesting class, <OL>because</OL>you learn about music in whole world <R>and</R> and like get to know many instruments of the <OL>other cultures</OL>.O K.O K.<OL>Good afternoon</OL>.<F>Um</F> I bought this stuff and I brought to back home but I didn't really like it. So<SC>cue yo</SC> could you exchange it back to my money?But I've already bought it just <F>er</F> <?>hours ago</?>.But <SC>I never touched</SC> I never really opened it <?>a lot</?>.So.<nvs>laughter</nvs> I bought a book.But<OL><R>when a</R></OL> when I wanted to read it, and I opened it. The front cover was a little <??></??>.<F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I've already decided my mind to buy it so it was <??></??> <SC>to</SC> <SC>nev</SC> I never really bothered to check it. <CO>So</CO>.O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs><CO>I thought you could <SC>change it</SC> exchange it with the same book or</CO>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Er</F> I was in a hurry. And it was present for my mom.And I didn't really have the time for the party. <CO>So</CO>.O K.<OL>O K</OL>.<OL>Thank you</OL>.<OL>Thank you</OL>.<F>Er</F> not really.Yeah.<CO>The shop difference between <OL><??></??></OL></CO>.Clerk.<OL>Between</OL> where?<OL><F>Oh</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> I think in Japan, it's more kind.But maybe too kind.Because whenever I like go into like clothes shops, it's like they just <SC>come</SC> go over to me and ask me like "What size would you like?". "If you want to try out for that?". But <SC>when I</SC> over there, it's like you can just <??></??>They don't really talk to you.Except when you ask something about <??></??> <F>hm</F> I think shop over there <??></??>.So <R>I</R> <?>I don't really have to</?> make the conversation?<SC>A man was</SC> a man called John was driving down the road.There was another man called Paul<OL><nvs>sniff</nvs></OL> riding on his bike, talking to his girlfriend.Then suddenly the two crashed. And <F>er</F> Paul's phone dropped on the road. And it broke. And Paul said to John that it's his fault <OL>that the</OL> phone broke.<SC>But John</SC> <SC>but</SC> and then police comes.<SC>And</SC> but John says that he shouldn't be talking on the phone while driving.And <F>er</F> then finally, <..></..> <F>er</F> <..></..><SC>Paul's</SC> bike got taken overand <F>er</F> <..></..> <?>the day is</?> ended happy.<F>Er</F> the driving on the car <OL>maybe</OL>.<OL><??></??></OL> he's talking on the phone.From picture <SC?>it's li</SC?> it looks like the car crashing with the bike, somaybe the car could have been more careful.<SC>Cell</SC> talking on the cell phone?<OL><CO>What <?>they</?></CO></OL>.<F>Oh</F> yeah.<?>I think it's</?> E-mail.Maybe writing E-mails are a lot cheaper.And maybe <SC>you jus</SC> you can just talk when you are free. On the phone,it cost more.<OL>And</OL> both of them have to be, like you know, free in time to talk <OL>a lot</OL>.But E-mails are like you can <?>out</?> back reply when you have time.<??></??><F>Um</F> like if you talk to friends in schools, maybe <SC>it's</SC> <SC>I can just</SC> I just E-mails but <SC>when you</SC> if you don't meet that someone a lot, you don't talk to he or her <OL>much, and</OL>maybe phone is better.<F>Uh</F> but he's like far away, maybe E-mails.<SC>I probably</SC> I might <SC>have</SC> just go to club butif I don't, I just go back home and studybecause, yeah.Math.<?>I have to study for</?> next <laughter>year</laughter>.<laughter><F>Um</F></laughter>.I don't think I'm that good but I don't think it's <F>urm</F> bad maybe.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> O K.Thank you.
