My name is .
 Sure.

I  a bit nervous because a lot of people are here.
 to me.   . O K.
Sure. My name is . I work for a Danish shipping company. . Shipping company means  operating company, not shipbuilding company. And,  now,  I'm in a export department for Europe export.
  so we export a lots of  cargoes  from Japan to   Europe.
It's a Danish company. So  we have  lots of Scandinavian ports, of course,     everywhere in the world.
Not necessarily, no, no.
 I take   reservations, we call it  bookings   from  manufactures or   trading .
.
 Right. . O K. .  for example, automobile manufactures     some contracts. .   to sell and to buy. And  they  make bookings to  shipping careers like us.   so we take bookings, and  we export 
cargoes.
O K.
. Free time? I go  to see my masseur.  For example,   even this morning, I went    to enjoy  massage.
And I like aerobics, and  I like jogging, and  I like learning languages like in Russian and French.
Exercise? Like ?
.
.   I would rather   something positive like doing something like  aerobics, jogging, and    I think it's a kind of why.
.
O K.
.    there is a teacher, and   there are  school kids in a like a classroom. One    lady is teaching    mathematics,  I'm not sure. And     one student's  very  serious. But  the rest of the all  kids    are relaxing and chatting and    and something.
 . Because he is looking at   the board.
And  I think  he seems to,   listen to  his teacher.
. How was that like?  . I don't remember. 
 . Because it's  so long time ago. . .
Sure. .   when I was   high school student in third grade,  I think everybody   listened  to the teacher. Because   we were facing   the examination
to pass university. But,   in  junior high school and elementary school,   it's just like this. 
Yes, I did.
Sure.
.
O K.
. Yes, please. .  I just missed,  my train.  I'm in a hurry. I've got to go to my office right away.   but my train at eight O five  was delayed. So,  could you  pay me back? . I just bought one ticket.   because my commute pass expired yesterday. So,  is it possible for me to pay me back?
.  my god.   where should I go or  what should I do?
  . But I have no time. I've gotta go to the office. . I've only one minute. ?
Yeah. I know, I know. But,  where should I go? .  I don't think you are a right person to talk with me.
Yeah.  do you think   it's possible   for me to talk with a station master?
. Sure.
 my god. . So, O K. . I've gotta go. So  I'll go to the office right now. I'll be back  at around four o'clock in this afternoon.
, is it possible?  will he be there?
.
Really? 
 it's not fair because I'm a passenger. I paid for the ticket. Right?
 my god.  But   I'm in a hurry, so I've gotta go  now. And  I'll buy another ticket.
.
 my .  .
O K.  at four o'clock in this afternoon. ?
Are you sure?
 great.
That's O K. Thank you very much .
O K.
Thank you.
. Yes, I have.
But  I don't remember something serious .
. Yes.
. Yes. I sometimes see,  not very often,
but   I have seen  some disabled people
 some problems
 and get off.
Like that.
.
 I'll be glad to help them.

but  I'm usually in a hurry  at  seven o'clock or eight o'clock  
and even in the evening. So    it's hard. 
It's difficult.
 . To help some ?
.  I think it's very big problem   for Japanese people because  it's a question of  Japanese mind or Japanese  nationality or culture.
Yeah. Because   very many Japanese people ignore
some disabled  people. .

.
 It is.
.
.
.  I don't have any time to rethink and ?


O K.  .  One day last week, I was planning to go on a picnic   with friend of mine. And     I went to  Yamanashi Prefecture and  try to make a tent to stay over night. But,  suddenly,  started raining. And     the rain was  strong.  so     we tried to   drive back. And   we just found a small hotel on a way. So   we changed mind and stay there over night.
No, .
Yes.
 .  .  No idea.
.  because I'm not interested. But,   sure,   it's not popular  thing.
Because everything is very expensive  .
To buy  a car   to get there. . 
Yes, I do.
I went to Vietnam.
. .
. I went to  Hanoi first, and I went to Hue next, Hue  which is a very very small town but very traditional, very beautiful city, old city like Kyoto in Japan.
   and I went to Hochiminh City,  commercial capital. 
And    I met  some friends. So,  even now,   I've write some  E-mail message to him. . They  give me back.
It is.
. .
 yes. .  not just with some foreign friends, but also  Japanese friends.
.
What's different? What's different now?
 .  What's different now? . It's a good question.
But  I'm not sure. What's different? .   I don't call  many friends
  since a couple month ago. 
Because I don't need to.
.  What else?  I'm not sure. .  What's different? .  I don't call them.  write 
 and I don't write any letters.
.
. O K.
.  .    I'll go to see my  
  doctor.
No,    yeah, Chinese doctor.
Yeah.

Yeah.
.
Thank you.
