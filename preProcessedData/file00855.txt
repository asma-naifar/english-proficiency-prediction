My name is .
.
Nice to meet you, .
 I'm not so fine. I have a cold.
I started to have  a sore throat on Friday.
I stayed in bed on Saturday, all day. I thought I had almost recovered, but I'm still have a sore throat.
 I think sleeping is the best .
Warm and sleep.     and   I took a  drug.
But it's not so  effective to me.
 .
 but  today's morning, I have to take .
 I couldn't go to the clinic.
.
      I usually clean the rooms,  do the laundries, such a thing. And   I sometimes go shopping.  But .
 Yes.
.    I go to Shinjuku,  and  I sometimes go to Odaiba.  .
Odaiba?
.  Yes.  I like Odaiba because     there are many modern buildings, and  there are some shopping malls.  And  actually I don't buy clothes   there. I just    looked at them. But     it's convenient, very clean.  and I have a daughter. So   she likes  there because   there are many shops  that sells     what children usually likes.
So, yes.

Yes.
Shall I start?
 Her name is .  This is her room.  She is in front of the computer now. She likes  Internet.  She often  buy books or C D    through the Internet.   she has two pets,  dog and cat. Usually dog and cat are  in bad  but they likes each other.  And     it's three o'clock now.  She thinks  she have to give  foods to them,  but both of them are sleeping now. So  she probably  restart to  Internet.
.  my daughter is still  eight years old.      my daughter's room is mess.
There are so many  comics books. Or stickers  or other goods are on the floor and on the bed, too.  She never    puts them.   
.
But    I have to  clean her room.
   yes.
I usually do.
.
  I just say, "If you don't    put them up into  closet or something,   I will throw away.".
.
Yes.
.
Yes.

Thank you.
Actually, I haven't  rent a video for a long time. But,     recently my child  go out with  her friends, so    I can have free time  for myself. So, yes, I rent a D V D last week. I thought it's good   for learning English for me, so I rent the  D V D last week.
Because    I can choose Japanese or English  of super or language.
So  I can read the conversation.   yes. . .
Yeah. .
O K.      one day last week, when Mana was walking  on the street with  her boyfriend, they heard a  voice  from a box.    when they opened the box,  they found  a cat  in the box.  They wondered what they  should do.    Mana  insisted to  bring  the cat to her home,     but her boyfriend didn't agreed to her.        he knows her  mother doesn't like cat.  So      she asked him  to tell her mother  the cat is  the present from him.   he was worried,  and actually he didn't want to, but    as his girlfriend wanted to do, he finally  agreed to her.
 I've never  raised  any  animals,  I'm not familiar to  any animals. My daughter want to have cat or dog, but she has asthma.
.
Not good.
.
  I usually finish my work at five thirty.
I live in Koto  Ward.
  it takes less than one hour from here to  get my home.
 yes.
Yes, but I live with my parents, 
they take care of my daughter.
Yeah.
.
 yes, yes. I've been working for a long time.
Thank you very much.
