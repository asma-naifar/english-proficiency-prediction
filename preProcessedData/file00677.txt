 He is a business man just like me. And he work in the company.
Yeah.
In this company? about or, no, no, no, seven months.
. Yeah. I'm fresh man.
 the job is hard, but I really enjoy it. Yeah.
 to get early, get a most of the different point. but I can earn money by myself, and you know, I can save or using or whatever I do I can. Yeah.
Yeah. actually you know, the fresh man salary is not so big. but I bought some suits or yeah, some wearing.
Yeah, except Friday. You know, Friday is a casual day. We call casual day, and suit is option. But except Friday, we have to wear the suits. Yeah.
 in my division, my boss wearing suits even on Friday. So most of the my boss is wearing the suits so I also follow that. So I don't have the casual Friday.
Why. I have lots of the chance to meet my customers. So the customers usually are wearing the suits. So yeah, that's why.
 That's right.
 I like playing football. Yeah. So I am playing football yeah every weekend, yeah, especially on Sunday.

Yeah.
 what would you like to know? 
Anything?
 we have a match every Sunday. So sometimes we practice on Saturday, and have a match on Sunday. So and now a days lots of the players are very young, and the team condition is not bad, I think. We can play
very well.
Yeah. That's right. I think so.
 I think there is some in the class, maybe I think it's university because the guys are not wearing the uniform. And someone is concentrate on the teacher. But someone is speaking with friends. And someone is using a mobile phone, maybe typing a mail. That's all. 
.
 I think in the class, it is mathematic class. And you know, some students is not interested in mathematics. And yeah, that's why.
Yeah.
 can't say it's good.
But, in the university, it's natural. Yeah. So just natural, I think. When I was in university, it's same like this.
 pers it depends on the people. So you know, this guy is very concentrate on the class. But university is very optional so how can I say, it's not good view, but it depends on the people. .
Yeah.
 maybe I will shout, say, "Shut up.". . But in this situation, teacher also to blame because she can't control this class so it's a problem. I mean that al quiet. . 
Right.
. You're welcome.
Yeah.

 I bought some clothes here. And unfortunately, I don't feel like wearing this color. So could you change it, or?
 But now a days, some shops change the some clothes I bought. So do you have any service like that?

 some shop staff recommend this color. But when I went home, and saw it again, I thought the color is not suit me so.

Nice color? Why don't you think so? 

 But I don't like it so.

Right.
 All right. . right. I'd like to talk about my lucky story.
It happened last week.
Yeah. .
 I tried to get on the train. And when I was waiting in a platform, the next guy suddenly push me by his elbow And I had a bag, and he push the bag so drop the bag down on the train lane. So but you know, the train lane is very dangerous to I can't do it because I don't know when the train was coming. And at that time, train was coming, and the train ran over my bag. And I felt my bag had already broken. So after train ran over, my bag is no problem. And rail staff picked it up, and I got it.
. 
 No, no, no. .
.
Accident. someone is dropped a bag on the rail. But fortunately, at that time there is no train, and pick up. So it's no problem. So I don't have the experience exactly like that.
.
 you mean the points of the uncom.
Anything?

No, no, no. I haven't seen it. in the crowded train, so some man is reading newspaper. And people is very close. So this news paper is just in front of me.
It's uncomfortable.
