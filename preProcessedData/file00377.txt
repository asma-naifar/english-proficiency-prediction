But      there are a lot of students and teachers. And  if you see the movie, you will get something new.

Is that ?
.  Last week,          I went to Mt. Fuji.
. And I          I went there     by our car. And  near the Mt. Fuji,      we brought our tent, and put the tent and    ate   and cooked our dinner by ourselves and   we ate it.
. But   suddenly,    it began to rain  late afternoon.   and then the wind   brew   harder and harder. And  we could not stand  on   the earth. So we decided to move  to somewhere,  by car. And on the way,   we found the hotel. So,  we decided to  stay at the hotel  that day. And  the hotel was expensive, but  it's very comfortable.  So, we could  relax  ourselves. .
.
 Yes. Sometimes. .
Yeah. There is a big difference.   So  when I  travel alone,          I can do what I want to do. . And also at the hotel,   I stay  alone. So   I have a lot of time to write a letter or to read books or I can relax by myself very much.
But  when I go hiking,  I often go with my friends. Because            to clime a mountain alone    I think dangerous. .
 I need a partner. .
And also    when I travel with my friends,   I can talk  to my friends about my work  my  friend about our company.  so    I can relax.
No.
      I'm going home, but I already ate dinner.
. . Thank you very much.
