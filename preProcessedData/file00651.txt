. My name is .
Yes. Sure.
I live in .
Yes.
That area? .    I live in the   residential area. And, you know,  has many factories. But  they are all in the  ocean area.
.   .  . I don't live there. And  is very  long city.
And    how do you say, I live in residential area, not in the factory area. And  what else?  . .
Yeah. I'm living with my family.

Parents?
.  My mother is a piano teacher. And she always plays piano.
And she teaches piano in my house.
And what else? . But    when I was a kid,  she always asked me to play the piano. But I didn't like to   I went outside to play with my friends. And     I wish I had played piano. But now, I don't play piano. I can't.
.
Now?
'Cause    I like music very much. But      as   for pleasure, I think it's very good to play the piano.  it's gotta be very interesting when I can play piano.
But, you know,  I don't know how. So  maybe I should ask my mother. 
In my free time? . Actually, recently I don't have  much   free time. .
. I'm very busy right now. But if I have free time,   I like to play sports. I like to play baseball with my friends or I like to go  jogging  in my free time.
  I belonged to track-and-field team when I was a high school student. And  at that time, I always ran long distance. And now, I don't belong any teams. But I like to go jogging.
? . A lot of people   have asked me that question. But  there is no answer. ,  I like to run, just.
 that's the     only reason I go jogging,  you know. Everybody  says that running is very, you know, hard,
and it's not interesting. But I don't know why   I like running. I don't know why. That's the reason. . .
  just describe?
. O K. .  It's a room. And   the cat is sleeping on the bed. And it is a dog. It's also sleeping  on the floor. And  there is a lady sitting on the chair.   and  there are computers and printer on  on the desk. And  she is looking at somewhere. And   there are   C D players on the bookshelf. And  the door is  open right now.  . Maybe   what,  she's asking someone how use the computer or how to set up the computer.  Yeah.  .
My own room?
     there is a computer in my room.   but     this computer is a desktop computer. But my computer is a    laptop computer. Yeah. And  ?      there's no  animal in my room. And    there are two big bookshelves in my room.   and there are many papers and  books on the floor.  it's very messy. And  this room is very  clean. .  My room is    much more dirty,
 this room.
.
How?
. How?  .  .
What purpose?
.  I surf Internet  with my computer.  or I send e-mail. And, of course, I write some  reports or essays using my computer.
What else? .
Functions?    I first bought the computer   when I was, what, when I was freshman at this university.
So maybe it's  five or six years ago.  I ask my friends  how to use computers. And  he told me a  lot about how to use computer.
And    after I learned the basis of using computer, I  what,   I studied how to use computer by myself. And five years have past.
 and I can use the computer,
very well. Yeah.
. 
O K.
.
  O K.
Yes.  I'd like to   change my tickets to  another train. Because   I've just arrived here and the train I had reserved   has already left.
And   I was late here. Because   the train     I took to get here was also late.
So that's the reason   I was late. So could you please change     to the ticket for another train?
   I know. But  you know,  the train I took to get here was late. So it's not my fault,  you know. .
.
All right. .
Manager?
So could you please call me your manager?
 so, what should I do? .    can I get money back?
Tomorrow?
 Is there a possibility that     I can have pay back?
Yeah. O K.
Thank you very much.
 .  that kind of trouble?
.  I think I've never had that kind of trouble. But    I think I'm very punctual. ,
             I'm not late.
And I think   I could always catch the train that I want  to catch.
So, no problem.
.
How?
I think     it depends. So    if there is a reason, I will explain it.
.  When I'm late,   I think I always have the reason. So  , you know,  I explain it. 
maybe   that's how I  you know,    that's how I explain.
May I start?
O K. One day last week,  one lady went to the department store to buy  a birthday present for his husband.  and          she bought tie for his husband as a birthday present. Yeah. And      she paid three thousand yen  for the tie. And after she bought  the tie,    she found that   the sale was going on there. And    she bought some  clothes for herself. And   now she got  a   lot of bags to carry  with her.  And she left the   department store.
Gift? .     in September,     I  bought  birthday present  for my father.
'Cause September twenty-first was my father's birthday. And  I bought handkerchief  for him.
, it's not so .
And   I know     my father  is always using   same handkerchiefs. So  I thought  I should buy  handkerchief for him.

Yeah. I think so. .
'Cause I live with him.

 I always go back to home  very late .
. But I can have some time to talk to him.
 very late  night. Yeah.
.
