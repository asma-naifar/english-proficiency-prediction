O K. One day last week,    I went to the station at eight o'clock to go to  work. . In the platform,    I mistakely drop my bag  on the rail.   Because   a gentleman   who is  my  left side   elbowed me.
. So,  I claimed him. . But    he didn't do anything to   help me to  pick my bag up from the rail. .    the train    came into the station.
And    pass over my bag. I was surprised. . Because     there were a lot of gadget  like personal computer or cellular phone in my bag.
  after the train    passed away,   my bag remained  in no damage.
        I'm sorry, after that,  a  railroad man came down to the rail and pick my bag up. And  
 gave me.
.
. Yes.
.
.  I'm in  human resource development .
So,  I'm working in English  to discuss about the matter or issues about human resource development.
. So, this is a   very, very difficult thing to communicate. .     if the discussion occur in Japanese, it is very difficult.
Because    I must think a lot of thing and   and   and express my opinion   correctly, it is very difficult in Japanese. But in English,  it is more difficult.
So,    to communicate in English, my work place is very, very difficult.
.
. . O K. . In the human resource field,     coach is tend to ask a lot of information   from student.
So coach  ask me, "What do you think about that? What do you think about that? Why do you think about that?", . So,   in the Japanese ,  there is no reason or no clear reason     to  my opinion.
  so  it is very difficult to  explain  the background or    back side information,
 to him.
.
Thank .
. . . Yes. .  last year,  my daughter  got a entrance examination to high school.
 so my family went to the  some shrine  for the learning.
. And     asked my daughter to pass .
So,  in this New Year,  we will go to the same shrine to thank  result .
Thank you.
