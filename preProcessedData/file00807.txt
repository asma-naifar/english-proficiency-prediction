I tried <F>err</F> in my house. So I didn't try at <SC>the</SC> this store, <SC>so when I buy</SC> so when I bought this <F>er</F> stuff.So <SC>the</SC> I tried in my <.></.> house, <F>er</F> say, <R>this s</R> this sweater.So this sweater <F>err</F> you know, that doesn't fit to me. So <R>the</R> <SC>the part of</SC> <R>the</R> <SC>the length of <SC>the</SC> this</SC> <F>err</F> length of <SC>the</SC> <F>err</F> this part, it's too short to me. So that's why I like to <F>er</F> get back. <SC>But <F>er</F> if you have a</SC> yeah, and <F>er</F> I look at <SC>the</SC> <SC>your</SC> you know, <SC>the other sw</SC> <F>er</F> other sweaters. But I don't like the others. So that's why just I like to get <F>err</F> back the money.<OL>So</OL> is that O K for me <OL><??></??></OL>?<F>Hmm</F>.<F>Hum</F>.O K. So if you don't mind, <R>could you</R> <F>err</F> could you talk to your boss or store manager so whether it's possible to <SC>change</SC> <F>er</F> get back the money?<F>Err</F> O K. So when so is he <F>er</F> going back to the store? <OL>Yeah</OL>?In two weeks? O K. So if it's O K, <F>err</F> <R>I'll</R> I will come back so after two weeks.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.Then <R>I</R> I will talk to the <F>er</F> store manager.Yeah.<OL>Yeah, yeah</OL>. O K.Yeah.<F>Uum</F>. Yes. Yeah. I like to shopping. Yeah <SC>the</SC> but <F>err</F> <R>I don't</R> <F>err</F> I don't spend <F>err</F> much time for shopping.

First, yeah, the golf shop. Because the golf is my favorite.<OL>And</OL> <F>er</F> other one <F>err</F> <SC>the clothes</SC> <SC>the</SC> you know, apparel. <SC>The</SC> just I like to update myself. So <R>what's</R> what's new <F>er</F> what's going on <SC>the</SC> you know, the fashion trend. So that's <F>err</F> my another favorite.<OL>Yeah</OL>.O K. The ideal golf club? So the first, the golf club should be <F>err</F> the appropriate weightfor me. So <SC>the</SC> if the club is <R>too</R> <R>too</R> too light, <F>err</F> the <SC>swing is</SC> golf swing is <R>not</R> <F>err</F> not <F>err</F> going accurately. So the appropriate <R>weight</R> weight is very important. Too heavy is sometimes so <F>err</F> <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's also not good.<OL>So</OL> the point is <SC>the</SC> to choose the appropriate weight club, fitting to me. <OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.Yeah.O K.<F>Um</F>.O K.<OL><F>Um</F></OL>.<F>Um</F>. My story?O K. And using this pictures?O K. My story. O K. <SC>The one day last week</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> <??></??> yeah, one day last week, <SC>the</SC> <F>err</F> I went to the station so nearby my house. So usually <R>I</R> I take a train from <SC>this train</SC> <F>er</F> this station. So when I was in the form of the station, so accidentally I dropped my bag. Because <SC>the</SC> this guy <F>ee</F> hit to <SC>my le</SC> <F>err</F> my hand. <SC>That's why</SC> so <SC>the</SC> I dropped my bag <SC>to near</SC> <F>er</F> on the rail of the train. So I complained to <SC>this guy</SC> <F>err</F> <SC>but</SC> <F>err</F> <.></.> yeah, this guy. <.></.> But suddenly the train came <R>into the</R> into the form. So <SC>the</SC> I really afraid my bag will be crashed by train.But once the train <R>went</R> <F>err</F> went away, so my bag was safe, no problem on the rail. <SC>So</SC> because <SC>the</SC> just below the train, so when train so <SC>passed <SC>the</SC> this</SC> pass this station. <.></.> Then I ask the people in the station so <R>to</R> <R>to</R> to pick up my bag <R>in the</R> <F>er</F> in the rail of the train. So he kindly help me to pick up and <F>er</F> pass the bag to me.Yeah.Yeah.<F>Um</F>.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>. O K. <F>Hm</F>. <.></.> I think <F>err</F> I would do the same thing. So <SC>I could not</SC> <F>err</F> <R>I'm</R> <F>er</F> I'm afraid to pick up my baggage by myself. Probably I ask somebody in the stationto pick up my baggage.<OL><F>Err</F></OL> <F>uum</F>. If this guy, <SC>is a</SC> <F>uum</F> <R>is</R> <SC>is</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>was caref</SC> <F>err</F> how do you call, is not careful,so about <SC>his attitude</SC> his behavior like this. So since this is the very crowded situation, so everybody <SC>have to be</SC> have to behave nicely,so especially so like <F>er</F> you know, the gesture or this kind of behavior is not appropriate in the situation. But if this guy, <SC>is just</SC> <F>err</F> you know, <F>uum</F> just <.></.> <F>err</F> did accidentally,so probably I don't get angry like this.Just, you know, say something.Yeah.<F>Hm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Er</F> this afternoon? Yes. I'm going to be busy. Yeah. I have <F>err</F> three meetings.<F>Er</F>.Yeah.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah. O K.<OL>O K</OL>. Yeah.
