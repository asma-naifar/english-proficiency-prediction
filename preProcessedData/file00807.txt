. And    one of them is  working for the construction company
in Kanagawa Prefecture.
. At that time, so I thought the  foreign company like  ,
so I thought  the salary is  higher than the other  Japanese company.
And   I thought promotion is  earlier
than  you know, the ordinal Japanese company. That's why   I choose  this company.
Yeah.

. .
Yes.
O K.  this is a kind of   class. Probably the junior high school or high school. So this lady must be a teacher and  teaching probably the mathematics. And   they are students. But some of them are not listening to   what she is talking about. So these lady are chatting each other. And   he is  drinking   some juice or water. But I think    this boy and this lady, so they appear listening to her.
 Yeah.
Yeah.
.    I guess  these bad students, so     they might be dropped from  this  class. They could not get  good score  on the mathematics. Probably they will have a problem in near future,
I think. Yeah.
 Yeah. Not so good. But  yeah,  just average students, yeah, I was.
 bad, especially    I belong to the,      I don't know the English name, but,  yeah,  handball team.
So  everyday after class so I played the handball. So everyday the hard practice.
So during the class, sometimes  I slept on the desk. So I didn't listen to , you know, the teachers. So    that was a problem. 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
O K.
O K.
Yeah. .
.
Yeah.  I bought   this stuff  at this store today. But  so  I didn't like this. So   I like to change and  if it's possible, so I like to get the money back to me.
.
O K. . . . 
. .  Yeah. I tried  in my house. So I didn't try at  this store,  so when I bought this  stuff.
So  I tried in my  house,  say,  this sweater.
So this sweater  you know, that doesn't fit to me. So     this</SC>  length of   this part, it's too short to me. So that's why I like to  get back.  yeah, and  I look at   you know,   other sweaters. But I don't like the others. So that's why just I like to get  back the money.
 is that O K for me ?
.
.
O K. So if you don't mind,   could you talk to your boss or store manager so whether it's possible to   get back the money?
 O K. So when so is he  going back to the store? ?
In two weeks? O K. So if it's O K,   I will come back so after two weeks.
.
Then  I will talk to the  store manager.
Yeah.
. O K.
Yeah.
. Yes. Yeah. I like to shopping. Yeah  but    I don't spend  much time for shopping. Quickly  go there and quickly decide and  you know, go back. I don't want to waste  time,
for the .
Yeah.
Favorite shop? Yeah. First, yeah, the golf shop. Because the golf is my favorite.
  other one    you know, apparel.  just I like to update myself. So  what's new  what's going on  you know, the fashion trend. So that's  my another favorite.
.
O K. The ideal golf club? So the first, the golf club should be  the appropriate weight
for me. So  if the club is   too light,  the  golf swing is   not  going accurately. So the appropriate  weight is very important. Too heavy is sometimes so    it's also not good.
 the point is  to choose the appropriate weight club, fitting to me. .
.
.
Yeah.
O K.
.
O K.
.
. My story?
O K. And using this pictures?
O K. My story. O K.     yeah, one day last week,   I went to the station so nearby my house. So usually  I take a train from   this station. So when I was in the form of the station, so accidentally I dropped my bag. Because  this guy  hit to   my hand.  so  I dropped my bag   on the rail of the train. So I complained to      yeah, this guy.  But suddenly the train came  into the form. So  I really afraid my bag will be crashed by train.
But once the train   went away, so my bag was safe, no problem on the rail.  because  just below the train, so when train so  this Then I ask the people in the station so   to pick up my bag   in the rail of the train. So he kindly help me to pick up and  pass the bag to me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
. O K. .  I think  I would do the same thing. So     I'm afraid to pick up my baggage by myself. Probably I ask somebody in the station
to pick up my baggage.
 . If this guy,        how do you call, is not careful,
so about  his behavior like this. So since this is the very crowded situation, so everybody  have to behave nicely,
so especially so like  you know, the gesture or this kind of behavior is not appropriate in the situation. But if this guy,   you know,  just   did accidentally,
so probably I don't get angry like this.
Just, you know, say something.
Yeah.
.
.
 this afternoon? Yes. I'm going to be busy. Yeah. I have  three meetings.
.
Yeah.

Yeah. O K.
. Yeah.
