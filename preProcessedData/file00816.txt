My name is .
Yeah, please. Please do.
Yeah.
Fine. I haven't taken a language test for long time, 
I just have been too lazy to take any test for long time, so I just feel so nervous.
.
This test? No, no. But I've taken a, you know, other language test like TOEFL and TOEIC. But I've never taken a spoken test.
 a spoken test partly because I didn't do well in a interview session. I'm looking for job and then they chose me as one of the candidates, but I think I was not chosen because my spoken skill was so low compared with other candidates so I thought this is a great opportunity for me to 
 practice, you know, my spoken English
 person who I don't know well.
 university.
 I am teaching English right now at a university but like I cannot really work there forever. there is like five year of time limitation, so I got to look for job before
 the time .
Yeah.
No, no. I am working
. I'm teaching eighteen classes now and looking for job.
 really give up working,
 I need to look for job.
Can't afford to .
Me? . let's see, what do I do? I really don't have too much free time at this moment because I'm going to a graduate school. And I'm teaching eighteen classes. But let's see. . when I have time, I enjoy spending time with cats.
 that's a most relaxing thing that I do at this moment.
.
 just being with them. people are really nice but I really don't know sometimes I I feel very comfortable with cats.
. I don't need to behave like as if I were other people. . .
. that's probably the, precious time
that .

 the cats?

 I anyways I had a wonderful cat, but the cat was and he brought so many other cats to feed . So strange cat. Anyway so some of them decided to stay. I got those they're at my mother's. I live alone in my apartment, you know, like when I see my mother, I can see those cats as well.
.
.
Yeah.
I suppose this is a classroom situation. And their age group vary. some of them are probably in their thirties and some of them are in their late teens. So this is like where high school dropouts can start studying again to get their high school diplomas, I guess. .
And teachers looks nervous.
 she reminds me of .
 students are not really interested in studying English. And they remind me of my students. .
 I suppose that yeah, I don't know. Just I don't want to be too judgmental but if this teacher is more interesting or more motivating, they may be interested in studying. I mean, and then also if she is more student-centered or whatever, because it seems like, to me, I mean, I don't know really what's going on but, they decided to study again.
So I cannot really blame students too much and teachers are responsible for their motivations as well.
. I think, the first of all, that the material should be more interesting. I don't know. . It's a good question. how I would manage this class. . the material should be something that they can learn without too much problems. And the materials should be related to the daily situations. I'm not saying every single thing that she teaches should be related to the daily life, but some should be something that they can relate themselves to very well. . But I really like this picture because lot of times in a Japanese materials, the teachers all has to be always men, but this happen to be a woman.
.
Yeah.
O K.
O K.
Hello? This is .
 I'm say that I'm sorry that I cannot come to the party. I really appreciate your invitation and I was gonna be there. But I have a work to do. And then I thought I can finish it by like two hours ago. for some reason although I worked very hard, I couldn't finish it. So I cannot make it to the party. I really apologize. . 
Yeah. I really understand, but nothing I can do. but if there's another chance, it would be nice that you could invite me again.

 I cannot expect I can finish this work within a couple of hours or anything, so I don't want anybody to wait for me. so in I would like to see them at another chance?
.
See you.
.
No.
No. I go to a party, the experience like this?
, no.
 when I determined to go to a party, I go whether I work to .
.
. the last party was I mean, at the previous work, my boss was so nice, he was always nice to me and we talked a lot because both of us are writing dissertation. then so this man finished dissertation before I did. so then he was invited to me a salvation party.
 I went there. .
Yeah.
.
 should I call this man by a certain name or what?
O K. Mister Suzuki went to the station to get to work. That was around eight. And he was waiting for his train to come impatiently. at while doing that, ner thinking about what he has to do at work. He has a big project to do. So he was, I guess, very careless. And then, a man next to him pushed him. And he dropped his bag. and the man and Mister Suzuki was wondering what they should do. . it doesn't seem like it's really good idea for them to reach the bag. And while they were talking, the train that the Mister Suzuki was going to get on came. And, of course, he was so nervous, and he almost had a heart attack. let's see. but, fortunately, the bag looked O K. And it was not damaged at all. things got out of the bag or anything. And the man working for train station came to pick up his bag. And then the that man gave Mister Suzuki the bag he dropped.
 no, I take subway
to Ueno and then I take J R
 the closest station.
 it's always packed. I really appreciate that I can ride trains because in the States, I had two serious accidents, you know, nothing really happen to my body or anything, but I'm not a good driver. And I really appreciate that I can take advantage of that transportation system. Although it's packed, then I just feel it's O K. As long as I don't need to drive, I'm happy.
.
 I'm going to work again. 
 then recently, I just talked to Mister .
I'm making a presentation of a computer-based TOEFL.
, yes. that's another job I have.
Yeah.
