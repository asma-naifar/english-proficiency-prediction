And there is an instructor and two people are <SC>taking</SC> <F>er</F> listening to his lecture. Maybe <SC>they wants to learn</SC> they want to learn <F>er</F> how to ski. They are beginners. And there are four kids <SC>playing with <R>snow</R> snowballs</SC> throwing <R>s</R> <R>s</R> snowballs at each other. And one man slipped <laughter>because of</laughter> maybe his bad technique.I don't ski but I have skied once. <F>Um</F> I used to be a junior high school teacher.<OL>And</OL> <R>I</R> I and other teachers took our students to <H pn="others8">XXX11</H>where where there was our sister school. And I had time to ski. And actually one teacher taught me how to ski for the first time and it was very helpful. But I haven't had any <F>um</F> chances to ski since then.How I felt?<F>Well</F> <SC>I</SC>it felt it was excellent. I didn't imagine that I could ski.<F>Um</F> <R>but</R> but actually I'm <??></??> and I slipped a lot. My students <OL><laughter>laughed at me a lot</laughter></OL>.But <F>er</F> gradually I improved.I hope I could show that <F>er</F> making efforts is very <laughter>important</laughter><OL><F>um</F></OL> to them.I hope so.O K.<F>Um</F> excuse me. I bought a C D player yesterdayat your store and I have a receipt here. <F>Um</F> would you exchange <R>this</R> this C D player to a new one? <F>Uh</F> because actually it was broken. I didn't drop it but it didn't work.<F>Well</F> it might be difficult. But <F>um</F> <F>uh</F> <F>well</F> I didn't check it at your store. And actually, I live very close to your <F>um</F> store, so there's no place where <laughter>I can drop</laughter><F>um</F> the machine.Do you have his cellular phone number?<OL><F>Oh</F></OL>.<SC>I</SC> yes, I can wait. <SC>But I hope</SC> <F>um</F> <F>well</F> I can wait <SC>for</SC> <F>uh</F> yes, O K.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL> thank you. So are you sure you'll exchange the C D player <OL><F>er</F> to a new one</OL>?<F>Oh</F> really. <F>Um</F> I hope you won't say that <F>um</F> I bought <SC>the</SC> this product a long ago.<OL><SC?>I</SC?></OL> <F>er</F> please remember I'm waiting.<OL><F>Um</F> I</OL> came here<OL><F>um</F></OL> only one dayafter I bought.<F>Ah</F> thank you.<F>Uh</F> thank you.<F>Well</F> <F>uh</F> <laughter>fortunately</laughter>, I haven't had any such experiences. But <F>er</F> I bought the computer <SC>through</SC> over Internet. And the package came to my house and I tried to set it up. But my floppy disk didn't work.So I called <R>the</R> the company and asked them to fix it. And it was the company's fault.Actually the connection was bad.But when the man who were sent from the company came to my house and <SC>pushed <OL>it</OL></SC> <SC>pushed the connection</SC> pushed the tool more tightly, it began <laughter>working</laughter>.<F>Um</F> <laughter>fortunately, no</laughter>. <F>Um</F> I have a virus detector and <SC>some virus</SC> some mail with viruses came, but <F>urm</F> the virus detector killed them<laughter>successfully</laughter>.No problem at all.O K.One day last week, <F>um</F> suppose <F>er</F> I am the driver, I was driving a car. <F>Um</F> I was on my way to the company. And the man <SC>in a</SC> on a motorcycle came <SC>from the <R>different</R> different lane</SC> from the different direction and <R>he was</R> he was calling his girlfriend with his cellular phones. And he was paying attention <SC>very care</SC> <F>er</F> at all. And <..></..> the man <SC>in</SC> on a motorcycle hit my car and dropped his cellular phone. He claimed that it was my fault. And he wanted me to pay the damage for him. However I argued that it was his fault because I knew that he was talking on the cellular phone which was illegal. We decided to call a police and the policeman listened to our story carefully. <F>Um</F> <.></.> and I told the policeman that the man on a <F>um</F> motorcycle were <R>calling</R> <SC>calling a cellul</SC> <F>er</F> calling with the cellular phone. And <SC>he understood</SC> he means the policeman understood the situation. <F>Um</F> <.></.> then policeman decided that <F>um</F> most of <SC>ma</SC> the fault is <R>o</R> on the man on the motorcycle. <SC>But</SC> <.></.> and the man had to go to the police. And <SC>the man</SC> <SC>the me</SC> <F>er</F> the man's motorcycle were sent to <R>the</R> the <R>fix</R> fix company.<SC>And</SC> but fortunately, my car wasn't <laughter>damaged</laughter>.But I had to lose some time.I would tell to both of them that <laughter>they should drive more carefully</laughter>.<F>Um</F> especially to the man on a motorcycle <F>um</F> that <SC>the</SC> he should never, never drive or <SC>rode on</SC> <SC>rode the</SC> ride the motorcycle and talk <R>at the same</R> at the same time. <F>Well</F> <R>to</R> <R>to me</R> to me or to the man <SC>wa</SC> who <SC>were</SC> was on the car, <F>um</F> maybe he could have avoided <SC>the sit</SC> <SC>this situation</SC> the accident, if he had <SC>dro</SC> driven more carefully. <SC>So</SC> but I'll just give him a warning.I'll scold the man on the motorcycle more severely.<F>Um</F> no, I haven't. I just hit <SC>my</SC> the back of my car<OL><F>er</F> <laughter>by myself</laughter></OL>.I just checked the dent <SC>of the car</SC> of my car. And <F>eh</F> I considered it acceptable. I left it as it is. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Still</OL>.<F>Um</F> <F>um</F> actually, <laughter>I don't have</laughter> any plan. So maybe it's already one o'clock. So I'll have lunch somewhere andgo back to <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Thank you.
