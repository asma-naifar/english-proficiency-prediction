Hobby.   my hobby is playing basketball.  I've been playing basketball for ten years more. So  I played in my junior high school and high school and  in my university. But  now, work is very busy.  but        not playing basketball is   not good for health. So   now  I am belonged to  my company's club, and    play basketball once a week.

O K. .  . This picture   describes  this  two people's   anniversary.  now  I think  they were married last year. And today  it's   one year anniversary for them. So        they comes to  the famous restaurant in Shibuya.  and now   they are drinking   red wine. And now  he is tasting wine. And this   a lady wears      pink sweater, and  has a   necklace with pearl. And this man wears  yellow suits and wears blue ties. And  they are talking about   their child. And  now   he is talking about    his child's  score in   his  school.  but      they love  their child very much. And  only today  they decide to    forget   their child.

  O K. My favorite restaurant is in Shibuya.    that restaurant is    very noisy. And  can drink  tequila. And so  to compare  this restaurant with  my favorite restaurant ,  a    and there is big difference. So, this restaurant is   very noble. And  very quiet. So and  I think  it's costs    about   two hundred  or three hundred  thousand yen. But  in my favorite restaurant   it costs  only   fifty and sixty thousand yen.
It's  big difference.
