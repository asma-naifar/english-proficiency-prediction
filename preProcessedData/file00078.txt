 I'm busy. Maybe.
Yes.
 I have to and, , most of my friends, appointments to go many place.
For example, and, , maybe I'll have a party with my friends.
So.
, my friend said, there is a bar. And maybe two or three days before, and so, they, to congratulate to have a party.
Maybe.
 yes.
.
 but, I didn't get any postcards or, .
 because, so I mean, last year, I had to have a, , I had to study very hard. So I didn't have any time to write, any postcards. So I didn't write or, my friends also was the same and, gave me a postcard. But, others, last year I didn't write anyone.
. there are many people. But, maybe there is a man and there is a woman, and maybe they are couples. And, they came here to congratulate on their meeting. so. And, they will have a dinner. And now, they are choosing, which wines or, champagnes, will they drink. And maybe after this, they eat, delicious, .
. , my favorite restaurant is near my house. but I think it's not a restaurant. , to be sure, it is it's very reasonable. And I think, that restaurant is very high price, I think. And the mood is very good. And, I can see the woman who plays the piano, so maybe there is a nice music. And, 
 yes. Yes.

Yes. Only once. when I was fifteen years old, Hawaii and I stayed there about five or six days and the Maui Island and Oahu Island. And I think, the Maui Island is better than the Oahu, because there are not so many people and especially Japanese people. and in Oahu, it is, good, I think, but there are many Japanese people and maybe we, don't have to speak English. they can understand Japanese, so, I think we didn't use any English in Hawaii. So, it's nice, experience for me but, I don't like Hawaii so much. 
 yes. , three students go wanted to go to somewhere. But, it was the rainy day. And they were wondering where, did they go. But, three of them thought, the movie theater. they didn't have to care about the weather. So they decided to go the movie theater. And they went to the movie theater and bought the tickets. And, so the movie is about, after they watched the movie, they were very exciting and, it was nice, holiday.
for them.
 Japanese movie? some of the works of I like. But, about other kinds of Japanese movie, , I don't know and I haven't seen. but for example, do you know "Ring"?
 I think, "The Ring" is the horor movie and I saw on T V. But I was interested in the movie of "Ring". But I didn't go to see that movie because "The Ring" is for me, it's horror. maybe I couldn't see all of that movie and, I think, it's not, reasonable.
. Because I paid much money and, go to see. so I didn't go to see that movie.
 I think so. . To be sure, it is nice place, because if they see the love story, the atomosphere is very good and maybe, they can understand the stand of heroine or hero. So, it's good. But I have never had a boyfriend 
Do I don't know, how I feel when I go to the movie with my boyfriend.
?
 yes. next week, maybe, I have to work, part-time job, and, maybe I also have to go to this university to study, in library, because I have two reports. And one of them needs to be written in English and other, needs to be written homepage. So I must come here and study very hard. And I have tests, next month, so, , I have to study very well.
Thank you very much.
