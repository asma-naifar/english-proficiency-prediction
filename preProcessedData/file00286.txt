. My name is .
Nice to meet you.
. Where from?
. From  Prefecture.
. Do you know the city ?
. Place? . You know, they have a soccer team, .
I think it's, maybe,  famous  for the soccer team.
And they have many department stores.
It's a very big city.
 .
. I like tennis.
. Last time? I was    learning and having the tennis course  in private  tennis club. And,  you know, ,   I'd rather like to   watch  tennis games on T V .
. It's  very exciting.
.  In free time,  I like to read books.
And  I love dogs, and I like to care about them and go for a walk with them.
. Two.
Yeah.
. One's name is Run because she  runs very very fast. And  she is got  surgery    about two weeks ago, and    she had to cut off tumor in her eyes, and she's getting well now.
   it was there about  an year and was just  very small like  at first. And we thought it was some  kind of,    how do you say, creature or something. . But it wasn't. it was a tumor and grew, grew, grew.
 yeah,   it seemed it didn't hurt her. So we  was just  kept an eye on it and became so big now, so we cut it off.
.
.
Yeah, I do.
 My father is  very  strange and square,  yeah, office man and  working for a company, and he loves jogging.
And, one day,     I came my home from the station. . He was jogging in the night. So   it is,  you know,   pretty dark and  a little bit dangerous that he might    crashed into the car or something. So    we  put   the brightening star on his hair, and  the light   goes  on and off. So he's , and
  I feel a little bit ashamed. 
He was very funny with star.
Yeah.
Yeah?
.   he just went on jogging. ,
just "Bye.". 
Yeah.
Yes. . This is a very  high grade restaurant. And the time is, I think, seven  at night.  and, front of this picture,  couple, woman and the man  is about to enjoy the dinner and     want to call this man. .     he showing the wine to a man. And I think the man is tasting and smelling the wine if it is O K for the night or not. And there are two other couples   in the restaurant. And they're  enjoying their nights. And,  beside the clock, there is a piano, and woman, I think, is  playing a nice   music there.
. Not like this. More cheaper. 
. Yeah, I think you see  these  carpet. . It's like purple carpet. And I    feel  when we walk it, we feel it's very nice.   so  I don't usually drink wine . And I think this is the western style restaurant. But  I prefer  Asian restaurant. So that's the difference.
O K.
.
Hello. This is .
Is this ?
. ,  thank you for your invitation.
And, by the way,  I cannot     make to go  to  your dinner party on the day.
Sorry.
  .    .          I  forgot that I have  my     cousin's    
marrige  party on that night.
 I forgot to tell you about that.
. I'm sorry.     it's from eleven in the morning  till midnight. So I think  I can't   join your party.

Go out with? I think, yeah, about Shinjuku, Shibuya restaurants.
Yeah.
. Eating out, window shopping and we go museums.
.  we see pictures.
Last time? Last time?  .  far away. . It's  in the Ueno  Museum, I think. . Then, the Tate  Gallery from  England    came. And   no,  we went to see the Picasso
last time, and that was about Picasso's  world of children. So Picasso drew many children.  and    it's a real</SC>  he draw it   pretty real at first, but,  then, they became it's like not real.
And the face was funny.
Those kind of things.
.
.
. From here?
.  . One day last week,  I looked into the refrigerator, and there were  absolutely no foods   to eat. I was very hungry, so I  immediately ran to the supermarket to buy some foods. And I  chose foods, and I bought bread and some vegetables here and meat also. And then, I bought it.  I went to the cashier and bought everything. And    I carried it  like on the back of my car. And then, finally,     I cooked sunny-side-up eggs. And   I cooked a lot more, and I could eat my breakfast.
Yeah, I do.
I cook   egg dishes or  salad.
. It's,  what to say,  scramble egg with  cabbages or lettuce and      mix together?
. So it's more simple and it's more healthy, I think, because I do like vegetable. Yeah.
.
After this? . I'm going to meet my old friend.
. She is my dormitory friend at  my high school.
She is just  came from Nagoya
to Tokyo.
And    she stayed at a doctor's house  last night. And the doctor is very  good man. . He is kind of a father of her.
Yeah.  he is very very,  what to say,  
, 
Chinese doctor.
And  he is Japanese, but,   what to say,  he is  applying  medicine of the Chinese.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
