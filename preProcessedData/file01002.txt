Yes.  my name is .
Yes   I feel tired.
 because  I came to Tokyo last night from Hiroshima by bullet train.  but I couldn't make  a reservation.    so   I had to stand in it.     I think  that's why so crowded. . Maybe  if  ordinary business  person's    took a holiday last Friday, maybe  they could get four holidays. So  maybe   they went to some  playspots.
On the train?
.   it depend on my mood.
   if I want to sleep is of course   I get sleep. .  without sleeping,   I usually reads  English textbook or  newspaper and so on.
     compared with  flight,      I usually like  bullet train.
  last bad experience.
.    If I take  bullet train next time,  in advance, I try to check  which is better,   flying or bullet train.
Yes.
.
Different points are  time.
. Time and cost and  last one is comfortable.  compared with flying,   it is comfortable for me to take a bullet train. And  cost is almost same. But a little bit    flying is  cheaper than  bullet train.  but it's  main difference point is  if I take a bullet train  I don't needs to  transfer    I can take   Tokyo station  from Hiroshima station directly. But     flying is   to have to  transfer,  for example,  bus, monorail, of course, flights. So, I prefer  bullet train.
 basically.
.
.  I usually go English conversation school. Or    almost sleep.   I always  sleep because on weekday, I have to work   by  midnight. So  I usually sleep or studying English.

Yes. . . One day last week,    Ken and Ken's boss,    he is name is  Mister Tanaka. . They went to the   Italian restaurant. .   they ordered  a set of menu. .
