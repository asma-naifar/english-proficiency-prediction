?
Yeah.
One day last week, I walked with my girlfriend in a rainy day. I found a box which I came closer to get better hearing. actually, it had a baby cat. And my girlfriend hugged the baby cat, and she wanted to keep the cat. But I said no. Then she was sad, so I was wondering if I can keep the cat in my home or not, and kept thinking and thinking. And then, I decided to we decided to think whether we should keep the cat or not. .
Yeah.
 yes.
 .
I like cat, but I don't think I can keep a cat in my dormitory, because nobody complains maybe, but I cannot afford to keep because of money. 
Stray cat? I don't know .
Cats? Living in Tokyo?
. I think they are fed well, because of so many garbage including leftover of food. So they're in good situation to live. I think it's much better than living in wild.
.
 I don't keep the cat, but I just can bring it to animal hospital, to do check up for the cat. and I want to keep the cat, but I cannot so I will leave it
to the hospital.

Yes.

I already hurt my back.
 also I shouldn't do those kind of thing because of my age.
 I'm already in my late twenties. So, 
I should work study or,
yeah, just doing part-time job and studying is disgusting enough
 for me. .
It sounds like that to my parents,
yeah, everybody.
