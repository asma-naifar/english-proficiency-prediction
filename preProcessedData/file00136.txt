So, <OL>yeah</OL>.This is a very good experience.<OL>Yeah</OL>."<OL>One day last week</OL>". <F>Ah</F> O K. Let me explain. <SC>The guy</SC> <.></.> <F>oh</F> one day last week, the guy went to his office. <F>Urr</F> so now, part one the picture is on their way to his office. And I think time is eight o'clock in the morning. And second picture is a, <.></.> <F>mhm</F> someone hit the man. And <SC>he</SC> <SC>man</SC> the guys <.></.> is a dropped <SC>the</SC> his luggage or baggage from his hand. And the luggage is <F>er</F> dropped, <.></.> you know, on the railroad. And third picture is a man was complaining about, you know, his luggage to <F>er</F> someone. And next to someone <nvs>laughter</nvs> is the other guy <SC>is just watched</SC> just <R>wa</R> was watching what happen. And the fourth picture is, I think the guy is asked <R>the</R> you know, <F>uhm</F> <.></.> the station clerk to <F>er</F> bring his bag to guys. And then <SC>the station officer</SC> station clerk is a you know, bring her luggage to this guy. <F>Urrm</F> fifth picture is, <F>uhm</F> fortunately, he could get a luggage again. So, <F>mhm</F> without a, you know, <R>com</R> complaining and <??></??> he <SC>dro</SC> <SC>ge</SC> got onto the train. And sixth picture is <.></.> he <SC>was</SC> <F>uhm</F> sat on train seat and <SC>wen</SC> he could went to <SC>the</SC> <.></.> <F>uhm</F> his office <.></.> without a, you know, big <.></.> deal.But <R>I</R> I think he was a little bit late, <F>uhm</F> than usual.<F>Mhm</F>. I hate <F>er</F> commuting by train. So <.></.> that is why <R>now</R> now I, <F>uhm</F> go to school by bicycle.<OL>Yeah</OL>. Because <SC>I</SC> my hometown is just, you know, a rural or <laughter>country</laughter> so, <F>urr</F> I <.></.> went to the <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> at first, so <SC>I'm sho</SC> I was shocked to see a, you know, crowded train. <SC>So</SC> and at first, <F>urm</F> when I went to school, <R>I</R> <F>mhm</F> I took a train. But <SC>I</SC> in the morning or in the evening, <SC>rush hour <F>er</F> is so</SC> <F>mm</F> I was exhausted into get on train. So <.></.> <F>er</F> I <R>gave</R> <F>er</F> gave up, <F>er</F> taking <F>er</F> train. So, <F>er</F> <R>my</R> <.></.> <F>mhm</F> my, you know, communicating <R>is</R> is <SC>changed</SC> totally changed from <SC>a train</SC> taking a train to bicycle. And especially rainy season is a, <F>mhmm</F> you know, the very humility is high and everyone is <F>er</F> bringing their umbrella. <R>And</R> and <SC>more worse</SC> what is worse, <SC>the very crowded train is a</SC> <.></.> <SC>I hate</SC> <F>mhm</F> <R>I</R> I feel uncomfortable. So that is why I hate commuting by train. So <R>now</R> nowadays or <.></.> now, I go to a school by bicycle.<F>Er</F> after this S S T, I have to go to school and to check a <.></.> <F>mhm</F> stuff. So next week, <F>urm</F> on Wednesday, I have to have a presentation for Master thesis. <SC>So</SC> but, <R>I</R> I <R>now</R> <SC>now</SC> right now, I never <.></.> do <F>er</F> about my presentation. So I have to check a <.></.> materials or I have to study or I have to check a references or. So <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> yeah, after this S S T, I have to go to school and go to library, and I have to study.Yeah.<F>Mhmm</F>. <F>Urr</F> I hope so.<OL><F>Oh</F> thank you</OL> very much.
