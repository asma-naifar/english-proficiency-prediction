And there are many kinds of students. I guess <F>um</F> students from <F>er</F> <SC>all of</SC> <R>all</R> all generations. And only a few students listen to the lecture and somebody <SC>is</SC> are chatting in the classroom. And there is a <SC>man</SC> middle-aged man who is chewing the gum. And there is a boy drinking a juice or something. And he is also listening to the music with headphone. And <F>ah</F> the girl is looking at her mobile phone. So there is only one student who <F>er</F> are studying the class. <R>The</R> the teacher seems <SC>to</SC> <F>um</F> <.></.> <R>she</R> she doesn't care what the students do and she <?>is keeping</?> teaching her mathematic lesson.<F>Well</F> my class was not like this.<F>Er</F> most of students listened to their class.

Because <R>in the</R> <SC>in the trip</SC> in this trip a lot of things are different, <R>from the</R> <F>um</F> from the brochure. So <F>um</F> I would like to know what happen the plan.Yes.<F>Well</F> I really want to my plan back and want to do what I planned in Japan.

And if tour the guide <R>doe</R> doesn't do anything, maybe I'll call the office in Japan or tour agency in that place.<F>Oh</F>. <.></.> Yes.<F>Um</F> my mother bought <F>er</F> sweets in super market and it was <F>um</F> Fujiya's Home Pie. But when I opened the box, the pies in the box was all black. So I can't <R>eat</R> eat them, of course, so I called the Fujiya's headquarter and tell them what happened. So <SC>they said</SC> they told me to send the box back and I could get a <?>free</?> <F>ah</F> boxes of pie.O K.Excuse me. Should I talk as if I am <F>er</F> one of them?<F>Ah</F>. O K.Yes.One day last week, I and my friend went to a camp <SC>with my car</SC> <SC>in my car</SC> <F>ah</F> <laughter>by</laughter> my car. And we got to place and we set up the tent and <.></.> we made curry and rice. And it was <F>er</F> very good. Because the weather was good and <nvs>sniff</nvs> everything was <SC>fine</SC> <SC>good</SC> going well. But <R>just</R> just when we finished <?>at the</?> set up a tent, the <R>clouds</R> <.></.> <F>oh</F> clouds covered the sky and it began to rain. <?>And, you know</?>, and we didn't care. <F>Ah</F> we thought that <SC>it would stop</SC> <SC>it will be s</SC> it would stop raining soon.

But just we relaxed in the hotel room, the sky was getting cleared and sun came up.<OL>That's it</OL>.<F>Hmm</F>.Yes.<F>Er</F> I don't know. But I guess it's because <F>um</F> most of people live in a city.So there's like, <?>you know, no wind</?>, any nature, so they want to feel the nature. Because that's it. That's the reason.No.Because I hate mosquitoes.When I was children, my parents took <?>me</?> camping so many times. I like cooking outdoor. But, you know, always <R>I was</R> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>er</F> I was a good <F>erm</F> girl for mosquitoes.
