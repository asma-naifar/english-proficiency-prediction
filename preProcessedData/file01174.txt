Yes. My name is .
 to meet you.
Fine. Thank you,
?

I live in   City along   Line.
Yes. Near the  Station.
Yes. It's very good place.
Why. Because  it's very   new place.    ten years ago,   near the station, there is nothing but a bank. But now we have  plenty shops,   brand-new and  so  Warner Brothers cinema and lots of  community hall or spaces,   city library or city hall   so it's very convenient to live there.
Yes.
Family? I live  with my husband  who works at  Japanese brokerage company. And I have   two daughters, and  older one   is  ten years old. She is going to be eleven next,  no, in July. And the other one, younger one is nine years old.
   with family?
 this season,  we just walk   around my  house, because  we still have  lots of trees and lots of parks. So we just going walk and have some tea at coffee shop.  Because   my children,   they are quite busy going to  or you know,  it's supplementary school, piano lesson or swimming. So we don't have much time  to do something with the family but  at spare time
we just go walk.
 not really.

.
 I see.     just once a week, on Thursday, I teach English.
 and the other day,    I am a just housewife,  doing many things
at home.
And yes, I do some  calligraphy lesson once two weeks.
   and my parents-in-law live near  our house and I sometimes go there to help, because my father-in-law is not very well.
.
  because my mother-in-law has to stay at home with her husband, so I sometimes go shopping for them. Or I just go to their house   to have lunch with them.  or just I listen  mother-in-law. Because she has so much frustrated and  she need someone   to talk to .
.
O K.
   describe?
. A lady is sitting  maybe in her room  in front of her  desk and computer.     and she has a bed, and so audio player in her room. And a cat is on the bed.  and a dog is sleeping beside the bed.  the lady seems to be talking to cat. Maybe  a dog .  maybe   she wants to talk to something about she saw on the computer.  maybe it's nine o'clock in the morning. Because it's not dark outside. The door is half open. And  she has also a telephone in her room.  she has a red typewriter which is not very common now
.  she's wearing  green  sweater and she's wearing blue skirt.   and  the calendar on the wall is June, so it must be June now. .
 yes.
.
 just  doing  by myself.  but I'm not very good at
 doing computer,  it's very   do e-mail with  my friends very often. And   that's the most things that I do on the computer.
.
.
.
Yes, I don't have to buy stamps, I don't have to go to post office if I do write letters on e-mail.   when I want to communicate with my friends in  overseas, it's more convenient. Because   it doesn't take any time.    and  we also can pass the e-mail to other people.   we have some groups. That's very convenient.
Yes.

 the things .
Damages.   when I was in France
I borrowed the scale  for my baby,
which is very old one. And then    the keeper said that they would come to  pick it up  on someday. But they didn't.
 so I called them in French.
And then  they said maybe a few days later they would come but they didn't either.  so the second time,   I was angry, and I told them I was going back to Japan so I had to bring it.  then the man came to pick . 
Yes.
.
.
O K.
 .   one day last week,    John was on the way to his office by his car  because   he was in hurry to get in time to do his work. And           the other man on the bike  was coming  talking on his mobile phone with his girlfriend. And I think he was careless  because  he was riding with just  one hand. And    then, when John  I said John? 
When John was trying to  turn right,   he didn't see the man on the bike. Then        when he was to turn,    he touched the   hand holding mobile phone with the man riding on the   bike. And then the mobile phone was  was smashing down on the road. John was talking to the man on the bike. A man on the bike was very angry because his mobile phone was  broken. And then they called police officer to talk about the accident. .     maybe John was explaining to the police officer that  the man on the bike was    riding with his mobile phone.  maybe   John was telling police officer that  the man on the bike was careless. And    because the bike was also damaged,  it was moved by the small truck. . 
.
Today?
   I don't know but  when I was a student, it was many years ago,  I was living near here.
Maybe I want to go  to see
the place.
.
