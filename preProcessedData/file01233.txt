You know, K-one grand prix or soccer,baseball, concert.<F>Um</F> you know, <H pn="others3">XXX06</H> is not very well-known place for artists <OL>or</OL> event promoters,so they don't <F>er</F> hold eventsin <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>.<OL>So I</OL> like enjoying going to events in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>.<F>Er</F> that's thevery difference.<OL>Yes</OL>, yes, if you like eating foods.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>One day last week.<.></.> <F>Hm</F>. O K.<F>Er</F> one day last week, <R>I</R> I remember it was Wednesday. In the morning, I was going to <SC>the station</SC> the nearest station to my home to go to office.And on the platform, <F>er</F> I was waiting for a train to come, of course. But suddenly, a gentleman standing close to me hit my shoulder by accident, not intentionally. And <F>er</F> my <F>er</F> <SC>bag</SC> very important bag <F>er</F> fell to the railway. <SC>I</SC> you know, <SC>I was</SC> <F>er</F> <F>uh</F> <R>I wa</R> <SC>I was upset</SC> I mean I was surprised and I got madat him although he was not intentionally trying to, you know, <F>um</F> <??></??> hit my shoulder. <nvs>sniff</nvs> But anyway, it happened. So I <F>um</F> asked him to <SC>pick up my bag</SC> just go down and pick up my bag. But, you know, it doesn't work. I mean <R>yo</R> you can't just step down on the railway, you know. So I was kind of at a loss and I was <F>er</F> looking for a <F>um</F> person who takes care of the accidents like that. But <F>um</F> you know, it's in the morning, so the train runs very frequently and <SC>one</SC> an express train unfortunately came into the station and ran over by bag. You know, <F>er</F> I couldn't believe it, my important bag. There was a very important documents and <JP>keitai</JP> and so on inside. <nvs>snap</nvs> So I thought that they were going to be broken, you know, scrapped. But fortunately, <F>um</F> after the train went away, I found my bag <F>um</F> as it was because the bag fell between the <SC>railways</SC> you know, <R>two</R> two rails.So it relieved me a lot. And <SC>I</SC> <F>um</F> you know, which made me stop <F>um</F> being mad at the gentleman. Finally, <F>um</F> <R>the</R> the person <F>er</F> working for the station kindly picked up my bag and gave it to me. So I <F>er</F> felt happy and went to work <F>um</F> <.></.> happily.Yeah. That's it.That's what happened <OL>last week</OL>.<F>Er</F> yes. <R>Two</R> two meetings.Afternoon.<F>Er</F> yeah, I hope so. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Urm</F></OL> yeah.Forty-five <SC>s</SC> minutes.As usual.I eat out.Yes. <SC>I</SC> you know, there are <SC>ff</SC> <R>only</R> only three or four choices outside the company <OL>and</OL>yeah, <SC>last</SC> yesterday, I had <JP>ramen</JP>, so probably today, <F>um</F> <JP>chirashi-zushi</JP> <OL>or</OL> something.Thank you.Bye-bye.
