And   we sat down the seat  and     I choose   about the meal.  and also    I asked about the menu    to the waitress and  I said, " what do you recommend?   what is the today's special?".  today's special was the  chicken fry    and fish. So  we choose it. And    we enjoy to eat dinner with my father. And   I was full.   and also  I cannot pay the money, because my father paid it.  so   I'm very satisfied.  and  when the dinner was finished,   I   said good-bye.
