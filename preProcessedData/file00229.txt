    I used to   go to for shopping with my family.  my son is playing soccer. So,   holiday,   I go to  see soccer game of my son.     I can enjoy it.
 he started soccer     no, no, no,  five years ago.
       it's a difficult question.   I'm not him.     when he is very young,   before entering the  elementary school,   I and him,    used to go see a  professional soccer game. And   he like it very much. Yeah. Especially,    Cerezo Osaka, which is a  professional soccer team,  he likes it very much.  And when he started to play soccer,        he loves  to  do sports. He likes to  move  his  own body. So  soccer is very   good for him.

Here is a  ski .   it's a  very heavy snow.      many people  are   enjoying  ski. .   most adults are  skiing but,  maybe their children is    not skiing.  they're  throwing a ball of snow  each other.  They seems to    do  game.    there is a   cottage.  In the cottage,  two people are  having a coffee or something.        next to the cottage, there is a    car  with a caterpillar.  in front of the car, there is a,   how do you say,     snow doll   wear muffler and  bucket.  .   in front of cottage,  there are some  ski.

    one day last week,    my father and I went to  have a dinner.     in the town       my father   asked    .
    my father told me he knew a very good restaurant. So  I agreed to go.    when we  enter the restaurant,   my father    asked the waiter   which table is vacant. And waiter guided us to  vacant table. And   we sat  at the table and    we asked the waitress to bring the menu  and then she brought the menu.   and  my father said  I ordered for the  cuisine.       I ordered the beer and fish, my father ordered the  wine and  chicken.  .  The cuisine was   very good. So  I've had enough  very much.    luckily my father   paid all of them.   , ,  and, ,  we went out the restaurant  and I said good-bye to my father.
 I'm going to  go back to my office and work.
Thank you. Is that all?
