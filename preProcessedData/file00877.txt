. Because  I have slept for over eight hours. . And I feel very refreshed. .
. Usually,  my sleep  only for   four or five hours.
. Because,   in this season,    I'm very busy in    my work. . And,  as you know,     in this season is the end of the accounting term. And    I have to  make a lot of documents for my bosses.  and I'm a accountant. . So I'm very busy.
. If I feel very sleepy,  I rush to the  toilet,  and      I sleep  with using the    tissue roll,        on the back of my neck, and   it is very comfortable. 
.
. I've not decided  to be an accountant. . Because the company    decide me to  be an accountant. . And I'd like to be a sales person. .   and now,  I have the same dream  to be a sales person. So  sometimes  I said such things  to my bosses. And   I would try to change my job to a sales person.
Yeah, I think so. . But,    maybe,  in six months,   I will change to the sales person.
. Because    I like meeting  anybody. . And,   as you know,  accountant is  working in the office, and the guest is   only for  my colleagues.  so  it's a very small world, I think. So    . So    I wanna be a sales person.
