One day last week,     I drove  with my car  in the street.  so,   a man   who was riding  his motorcycle  with calling
 mobile phone. And    his mobile phone and my car  clashed.
And  he was very angry
 because  his motorcycle and his mobile phone  was broken.
But  it was his mistake, I think,  since   he was riding and with mobile phone.
It's  very dangerous.
So,   it was   not my responsible.  so, I  explained  the things to the policeman.
 and he agreed
 my opinion.  rided ma    so,  I called  wrecker
and    made    his motorcycle   send  to the  factory
to repair his motorcycle.
Yes.

Yes.

Yes.
 I have a plan   with my wife
 to have  something eat.

Thank you.
