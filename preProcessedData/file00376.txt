And she want to bring back to home, but Ken  doesn't  accept hers  hope.  but  Minako try to ask to him again and again. And finally,   Ken  agree with hers  demand, and they bring back to  the dog to  theirs house.
Actually,  I'm having pet at my parents' place.
. I would like to bring him to my place, but    that is a kind of mansion, and I can't have the animal at the mansion.
  I don't know. But when    not talk maybe the animal can relax the human's  heart or,
.   I can't understand their feeling. Because  the dog or so animal cannot talk but     they have life and   I can't understand  the people can throw away animal like a garbage or something. They are  they have the feeling.
 Maybe  I do  .
