But when I buy <F>er</F> engine parts from foreign countries <F>er</F> I don't get in touch with foreign country people directly. Because there is an importing group in our section and <R>they</R> <F>mm</F> they deal with foreign countries.My hobby is <F>er</F> baseball. <R>I</R> I like playing baseball and watching baseball. When I was in university, I played baseball everyday. I belonged to a baseball club.Yes, almost every week. Every weekend I play baseball.<F>Urm</F> various people. <F>Erm</F>. <.></.> <SC>My</SC> I belong to two teams. Both teams are not connected with my company. I found both teams by <F>er</F> Internet.Yes.<F>Er</F> one year.Yes.<F>Mm</F>. I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX02</H> prefecture and my parents <F>er</F> live there.

And my father <SC>will</SC> is going to retire this year. <.></.> And <R>I</R> I'm going to meet them <F>er</F> this weekend because the big holiday is coming. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F>. A party is going on and <F>er</F> <.></.> a young couple <.></.> are sitting on their chair. <.></.> <R>And</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> and they started drinking wine. <.></.> And after <R>the</R> the man <SC>drank</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> <SC>dri</SC> drank a little and he is <F>er</F> <R>de</R> describing the taste of the wine.

But the train has already started. I couldn't <F>er</F> get on the train.

And ‚hdon't have <F>er</F> enough money for another ticket so <SC>I really</SC> <F>erm</F> I'm really in trouble, and I want you to change this ticket.Because <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I came here by bus but there was a big <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <R>tra</R> traffic jam. And so I couldn't <F>er</F> come here in time. <F>Er</F> Because there was a car accident.

No. <R>I</R> I have been to foreign country only twice.<F>Er</F> I went to Hawaii.<F>Er</F> I have been to Hawaii twice.<nvs>laughter</nvs> I went there to run marathon, Hanolulu marathon.<F>Er</F>. <SC>It</SC> <F>er</F> first time when I went there <F>er</F> a friend of mine <.></.> <F>er</F> said <F>erm</F> "Let's go to Hawaii to run marathon <SC>for the</SC> <F>er</F> for a graduation trip.". So I felt interesting and maybe <F>um</F> to run a marathon <F>mm</F> must be <R>very</R> <F>er</F> very hard thing. <R>But</R> <.></.> but <SC>I thought</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I want to <SC>experience <.></.> of</SC> experience to run marathon <F>er</F> once in a life. So <F>er</F> we went Hawaii <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <R>with</R> with about <F>er</F> twenty friends. <.></.> And we sleep there for a week.
