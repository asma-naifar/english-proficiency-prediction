My name is .
I'm in the purchasing department, and I'm responsible for buying engine parts. . I buy electric parts mainly.
.
Yes about seventy percent is from Japan and others are from foreign countries. But when I buy engine parts from foreign countries I don't get in touch with foreign country people directly. Because there is an importing group in our section and they deal with foreign countries.
My hobby is baseball. I like playing baseball and watching baseball. When I was in university, I played baseball everyday. I belonged to a baseball club.
Yes, almost every week. Every weekend I play baseball.
 various people. . I belong to two teams. Both teams are not connected with my company. I found both teams by Internet.

. A party is going on and are sitting on their chair. And after the man drank a little and he is describing the taste of the wine. And the the hotel-man , who is serving the wine to them is listening to the young man describing the taste of the wine. 
Sorry?
. No. I don't go restaurant though I often go to 
. when we go to our purpose is to drink beer and get drunk, and have fun But when we go to these kind of restaurant the purpose is to feel the atmosphere and taste which we can't eat usual life. the main difference is the atmosphere, I think.
Yes, I'm in trouble. I reserved a seat of the train. But the train has already started. I couldn't get on the train. So I want you to change this ticket for another train or pay the money back.
. I have to go even if I will be late. And ‚hdon't have enough money for another ticket so I'm really in trouble, and I want you to change this ticket.
Because I came here by bus but there was a big traffic jam. And so I couldn't come here in time. Because there was a car accident. I couldn't expect that so I couldn't come here in time. being late?
O K.

 I went to Hawaii.
 I have been to Hawaii twice.
 I went there to run marathon, Hanolulu marathon.
. first time when I went there a friend of mine said "Let's go to Hawaii to run marathon for a graduation trip.". So I felt interesting and maybe to run a marathon must be very hard thing. I want to of once in a life. So we went Hawaii with about twenty friends. we ran the marathon.
One day last week, we're talking about how do we spend the But weather cast said it will rain that day. going out without rain, somewhere we can avoid the rain. And suddenly we came up with a good idea. We decided to go to movie theater because before. bought tickets. was two thousand and five hundred yen. And after we bought tickets, we bought popcorn and coke drinking and eating. about an movie was very exciting. and after we finished watching movie, we went out of the movie theater and talked about the movie. And we could have a very nice time. And that's all.
When? . To play?
. the third of May.
Now? . I don't practice, I want to have a game when I was in university, I really practiced baseball hard but now I don't want to practice anymore.
Yes, but play hard.
