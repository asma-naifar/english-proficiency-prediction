.
.
 . My name is .
.
. Of course. Sure.
. I have a little bit cold, so I have a stomachache. So I wonder I could come here today or not because it was snowing in the morning. And you know that my home is in  in . It takes more than two hours to come here and have to change trains three times. So I wonder I really could come here or not today. But I'm really happy to come here and have a test today.
.
Nothing in special. But   I drunk  hot ginger. What shall I say? Hot ginger or something like that. Yeah. To put honey and ginger. It makes me warm.
I don't like. Even though I like skiing, I don't like cold weather. Because I am easy to catch cold, and I have to worry about my children. Yeah. And my daughter is really easy to catch cold. .
My son,  he is O K. But
 my daughter is not .
Ski trip? Yeah, yeah.  we haven't been to ski with my family because my son is already good at skiing.  so she must be worried about me, because I'm not good at skiing. But, in my younger days, I used to go skiing with my husband. At that time, he was not my husband at all, but I had a  lot of great time with him. .
We used to go    Shiga Kogen, because both of us  originally come from Osaka.
So I heard  from my friend that many people living in Kanto area go to Zaou, Tohoku area. But,   people living in Osaka or Kansai area,  maybe, I think, go to Shiga Kogen, Nagano Prefecture. .
Because it is near  from Kansai area.
. Really? . It was really nice. There are a lot of cute houses. . They sell fancy goods. So, when you are young, you real like   so many cute sweatshirts or fancy goods. So   I used to buy some fancy good when I was young. And now, my daughter, ten years old, has a  same kind of  hobby or taste. .
.
. The most  clear thing is the taste of food. . Especially, . So   the color of the soup is different.    I'm not sure, I should call that our  like that. But  ,  you can eat in Osaka very  what shall I say, clear color.
. Compared with  in .   first time I saw  in , it was like . So the color is very thick. Yeah. Very strong. And the taste is not   so good for us. 
So   I wonder what they eat when  people in , they have cold. . When we have cold, we eat , but we can't find any  store in Kanto area. .  but one of my friend told me when they have cold, they eat  or .
Yeah. We tend to take  a lot more, instead of .
Yeah. Maybe, I think, the same. But children in Osaka   are much more interesting, compared with the one in  area.  . Excuse me.  So my son and my daughter can understand what my husband and I are talking in Osaka dialect. But they can't repeat in a right intonation and right rhythm. So,  when they try to speak in Osaka dialect, for them, Osaka dialect is not  Japanese, but some kind of foreign language. They really try to imitate.
. Yeah.
. A women is trying to tell the dog and the cat how to use computer. But they don't have any interest in them.  So, maybe, she doesn't have any child. So that this dog and this cat is, for her,  like her children. So  she spends a lot of time with them. And these two animals   have good relationship each other. Maybe, the dog  came this home earlier than this cat.        but I think she likes this cat a lot more. Because  dog is really loyal to any other human beings. On the other hand, cat is not.  but,  for women, they have a tendency to take care of the one who doesn't have any interests   for her. But they have a very good atmosphere. And she must have a job at home. And, even though she is really busy,   she is really happy with them.
.
.   because  I never taken care of any animals because I have an allergy. But one of my friend told me that it is easier to take care of dog,  compared with the cat. So, once she is used to tame one animal, she tries to tame another kind. So that I think dog comes first.
.
.
. Itches, and I can't wear my wedding bands, because metallic allergy. So my husband wears wedding bands, though I don't. So it's a really strange thing. Because so many women  try to wear wedding bands, but     husband  don't want to wear them,  maybe. But, in my case, he wears, but I don't wear.
.
.
O K.
.    can I ask you  what was your name?
? O K, O K.
Hello, . This is .
Hi. I'm afraid I can't go to your party. Thank you for invitation.  I really wanted to go, but I couldn't. Because my son is sick in bed, so I have to take care of them. He is all right right now, but  he threw up last night. So  I'm really worried about him. I can't leave him alone at home. I'm really, really sorry.
. I really miss them. But   he is twelve years old. I think if I explain it to him, he could say, "All right,   Mom. You can go. I can hold myself.".  so, when it  come to throw up, maybe, he has to take medicine. . Yeah. I'm wondering if he throw up. What  he would do taking care of himself. So I'm really, really sorry. Please say hello  to some people    you've invited. And, please don't forget to invite me again. ?
.   he is on the business trip, and he is now in Osaka. I wish he was there right now.
.
 . Truly sorry.
.
.
. Thank you, I will. .
Bye-bye.
. Thank you.
. Many times. Because I have two children. .
. So, first, my son gets cold, and, next week, my daughter will get cold, and, the last, sometimes, my husband. And, unfortunately, at last, I myself got cold. So, in that case, I can't    not especially go out. I can go out to buy some glossaries, but I can't go to Tokyo, or I can't get together with my friends for a whole month.  but it's really nice to have two children, one son and one daughter and  a nice husband. So we sometimes think about    we will be very happy. Even though I like my mother-in-law and my father-in-law, the life would be different if we live together. So I am enjoying my life now  with four family .
. To keep it secret   to my father-in-law or mother-in-law.
.
. One day last week,   I went to a department store to buy a nice necktie for my husband's birthday. And  it takes a long time to decide   which tie is suitable for my husband. So I ask some of the sales representative which one is the best. So I finally  decided the nice tie. And, after I paid  for that,       I deci saw many good shoes. And they were for sale. Thirty-percent discount. So I was wondering I could buy or not. Luckily, I have my  credit card, so I think I could use it. And I bought one pair of good  shoes. And, after that, on the right corner, I saw another good thing. That was clothes. That was so beautiful and nice. It would be very nice if    match the shoes I've already bought. So the color is nice, very suitable for spring. So I decided to buy both skirt and blouse. And I  went on buying, , buying. And, at last, I bought many things. So I didn't think when I  just went into the department store. But I'm  really happy, and my husband will be very happy   if I wear beautiful clothes suitable  for his tie.
. It's good. . You can buy, maybe, double. .  and you can save a lot of money. But the    one thing it is not good is  you spend a lot. 
. Thank you.
. Maybe. . Because my son told me that he has a slight stomachache. So I really like to be at home when he comes back.
. But he comes back at around four o'clock. So I think I could have  something to eat for lunch.
. Thank you .
I really appreciate. .
