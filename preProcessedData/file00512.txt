So the box  was  closed.  and  also, I think the    something in the box  don't   wet for the rain.   and there is a cat in box. .  but    the cat was     brown hair.     my girlfriends   said, "  I want to  take this cat to my house.".   but I think  her parents  permit  to bring the cat to house.        so I rejected to        take the cat. . But  she   insist  to take the cat. So   finally,  at I      permitted to  take the cat .
   I had a  rabbit.
