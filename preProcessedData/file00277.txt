  . 
Yeah, because      I could not   sleep well.
   yesterday night,    I was going to bed  around  two .   and  I wake up this morning around five-thirty.

    I handled import-export business  and  now,  my partner   is  wedding vacation,  so I have to work for her.

Yeah.

    it requires   export-import   rules and  documentation skills     and contact  other country's people   by  e-mail.  recently,   I don't use the telephone   to overseas.  .

   .   this room is    home office, I think. And  she works at  her house  using the computer and    use  typewriters and  she have pets,  one cat and one dog.    now she's relaxing.  maybe she will start to make some documentation of report. .     I think sometimes  while she work,   she's listening music or  radio. .

.
.  I think  on  the people.
     if I work at home,  it is difficult to manage   my time,  so    what time  I start the work
and what time until the work.   but  if   I work at office,           the   schedule is    fixed. Yes.
   so it is easy  to control the     work volume.
