And maybe I will start jazz dance from next semester.
. . .
But I've not taken action yet.

So I don't have so much time now.
So I don't know whether or not I can start jazz dance.
.
. Actually, my courses.
. I take some courses for becoming English teacher.
 all courses are extra courses.
 so I have to take more classes than classes required. So I've been busy. And, now I have to take many examinations.
And I have to hand in some essays.
So very busy.
Hobbies. maybe just talking with my friends. 
Yeah. And I like playing the piano.
But now, I live alone in . So I don't have piano here. So I don't have opportunity to playing the piano. So my skill get worse and worse. .
.
. . I started to take piano lessons when I was five or six years old.
 I kept on playing the piano till I was eighteen,
years old. So actually, I wanted to become a piano teacher. how should I say? I don't know. But I want to go to university for music,
 piano.
. but I'm interested in English as well. So and actually, I was belong to volleyball club.
 
 and I played volleyball very hard.
So I didn't practice piano very much.
And then, piano turned just my hobby.
.
.
. O K. . when teacher is explaining about mathematics, in spite of this, many students don't concentrate on her story. two students are talking with each other. And one student is drinking something. And then another student is chewing gum.
But only one student is studying very hard. he is sitting in the front seat. . e-mailing someone, maybe.
.
 actually, I went to a private high school and very strict high school. So I can't believe this kind of situation in my high school.
So, all students were studying very hard. And teachers always strict. So we couldn't talk during class.
. but when I was a junior high school student, classes were like this picture.
Yes. . So this picture is like my junior high school student class.
. . .
 very bad. 
. I can't believe that this guy is making balloon .
Yeah. His attitude is very bad, I think.
. . . When I was junior high school student, I chewed gum by secretly. 
. So not in presence of teacher.
So I mean, at toilet,
or backyard,
 junior high school.
.

O K. .

. Actually, I got this 
T-shirt at this store. But actually, I don't like it.

 for another one, please?

But this T-shirt is very fashionable now.
 this kind T-shirt is in now. But I think I again, "But maybe this kind of T-shirt will be out next year.".
 so I want standard T-shirt very usual T-shirt.
So I need another T-shirt.

. Excuse me. . Is this girl is me?
.
. one day last week, a girl and a boy were walking along a street on rainy day. . they heard cat's voice. . Especially, a boy realized that a cat a boy realized cat's voice. and they found a box . When they opened the box, they found a cat. . . And she asked her boyfriend if she could . he said no at first. But she asked him again and again. So he allowed her to bring a cat home. . because she had a cat, she couldn't have her own umbrella. so they used the same umbrella and they went home.
