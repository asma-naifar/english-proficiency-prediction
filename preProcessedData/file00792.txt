S S T.
 . I know you are trying to yeah, investigate what level my English how can I say, I'm interested in measuring speaking ability using I R T.
And G theory. And the purpose is to introduce speaking test into the entrance examination because the Ministry of Education has focused on the improvement of the speaking ability. But there is no speaking section into the entrance examination. So there is a big gap between the class content and the purpose of the guidelines. Of course S S T one of the speaking test, but I believe the S S T is proficiency test. But my interest goes to the achievement test.

Train system ?
 not system, but is very crowded, and is not so crowded. not system again, but so expensive, you know. . But most system is very punctual. And they should be very proud of it. But is two or three minutes delay is a matter of time, I mean it's of course, you know. So they should have more punctual system or systematic.
.
 I don't like picture test.

You have to choose . 
.
 I should start now?
 a man is driving a car. And another man is riding on the bike while he is talking to the his girl friend on the phone. But unfortunately, what is that? as the man a riding on a bike why is that? So he is absorbed in talking too much so that he had ignorance of shit, I hate that, coming. so he had a car accident. What a messy story, I don't know. two so the two man had quarrel to be blame. and so they call for a policeman's help to solve the problem. And the man who drove the car, his argument was the bike man had talked with his girl friend using mobile phone so this is his fault. I'm sorry, seem to accept the man's statement who drove the car. And finally, it seem that a solved. And the bike was carried away by truck. .
I don't like .
. But I'm not sure about number there's pictures.
. reasons. For example, the when you use mobile phone on train, that makes passenger very noisy. and I happened to listen to his talking, and the talking is nonsense, you know, just like B U L L S H I T, you know. but some people are needed to use mobile phone such as the salaried man or older people like you know, in my case, for example, some children has sick, and his mother need to contact with his father. But most of them are just like fashion. Everyone has it so I have to do it. you are talking about.
