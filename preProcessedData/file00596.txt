So sold ties. and I find one and bought it. and way back on the way back, I found there is a final sale said they sold it so I thought I don't have this chance so I thought to just look at something . But I couldn't stop buying one of them. Then I keep walking another when I went to the clothes shop, they sold shirts and blouses and dresses. they sell them for fifty percent off. so " why not buying I thought. And I found a blouse very much my taste. and it was fifty percent off the price. So I bought that one also. so finally, I bought many things and went out from the department store.
. . yeah I also choose necktie or scarf or something. but my father has his taste.
 it's difficult to find one.
But my mother don't know what she herself like.
So I think it is good idea to buy her something to wear.
