And    his facial expression tells    the wine is fine.  it is red wine.    and   the waiter   brings   other bottles of wines.  so maybe she asks  them   which they prefer.    and   more tables  there. And also  a pianist is playing a piano      the  backside. And   the next to the piano, there is a  big clock. The time is seven.

. .  one day last week,      I went to a department to buy  my husband's birthday present.    so         I was thinking of buying something small  and  maybe  something    like a tie. So  at first, I went to a place    they  sold ties.  and     I  find one and       bought it.  and    way back on the way back,     I found there is a final sale  in shoes shop.    they  sold them for thirty percent off.  so I thought          this chance  to just    look at something  . But I couldn't stop buying   one of them. Then     I keep walking  and       when I went to the clothes shop, they  sold shirts and blouses and dresses.   and  they sell  them for fifty percent off.  so " why not buying  one of it?",  I thought. And I found    a blouse     which color is    very much my taste.  and it was fifty percent off the price. So I bought that one also.  so finally, I bought many things  and   went out from the department store.
.  .  yeah I also choose        necktie or scarf or something.  but my father  has    his taste.
 it's difficult to        find one.
But my mother      don't know   what she herself like.
So    I think it is good idea to buy her something to wear.
    I'm going back   to the house. In the evening I have a  job. And before that I want to      cleaning my   house and make some food.
