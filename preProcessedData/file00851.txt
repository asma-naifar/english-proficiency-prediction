Yes. Since five year .
Yeah.
No, by myself.
My family lives in Kumamoto in Kyushu.
.
Yes, I am.
 the way talk.
Yes.   when I came here,
and, when I talk the way I talked in Kumamoto, they couldn't understand any.
  actually, a little. But,  not at all.
, but not that much.
 I'm not sure  what I .  I said something to my friend, ,
you know,   the  tone was nice and smooth.  but, when I stopped talking, and every my friends, I guess, like shocked. 
. "What did you say?", and something like that.
.
Yes, .
  actually, I'm in university.
 and, now it's spring vacation. ,
actually, I didn't do anything.  now I'm going to driving school
to take my license, but it's not started yet.
 actually,  not because I already have my bike's license. 
it should be easier
 others.
 because I don't have to study on the desk.
 just drive and  that's all.
 I don't have any test for getting my license. Just only drive.
 I drive good, it's good. 
.
Yes, I do.
 sometimes, yes. But, if you ride the way
right, ,
 it's not dangerous at all.
Right, right.    right for law and follow the law ,
you know, and safe speeds.
And  you brake faster than others, you know. And  anything else?
.
My hobbies?    used to be,  I liked to climb mountains.
Yes. But,  lately, I didn't go because   none of my friend goes to mountains.    I  
a lot to fall off.
 fall off?
 it's much more fun when I go to with my friends. .
Yeah. .
Sure.
.
O K.  they're having math class. And  the some of students listen carefully, but a little, just  two that I can see. And  one student chewing gum, and  two of the girls are talking. And one guys,   he is not sleeping.  he is drinking    something, listening music. And   teacher is lady, and the window is open. .        yeah,  actually, just one student is listening, just one. And one other is  not listening,  having fun with, , mobile.
 that's  about at all,
I think.
And, should I say anything else?
. Yeah.
 think so.
Sure.
? O K.  we wear the uniforms.
 it's one difference. And  none of the students chewing gums and drinking anything. And   the teacher is   .
And   what else?  .  about same instead of it.
, because  we didn't have mobile phone when I was high school student. So it's different.
. Yeah,  I think
that's all.

very American.
Yeah, because,  actually I was in the American high school, too,   in Michigan
and took   math class also. And  it's about same. Talking, drinking something, with listening music and chewing gums and  not listening   teachers are saying. . But, instead of the mobile phone,  that's about same.  but  they are little hard worker. 
 actually, I do love the school in Michigan because   teacher was nice. And it was very fun to listen in English, and  talk in English, and study a lot because  I was good at math, and  none of the students are good at math  in America.
Lots of students   in Japan are much better than Americans, so   my friends and teacher said, like, I'm genius, you know,
 it was fun, and   it was nice to stay there and learn that thing .
. Yeah.
.
. Sure.
O K.
Yes. I think so.
Yes. Hello. It's   calling. . .
Yes. Hello.    I'm sorry.      when I came back my home, 
 my window was broken, you know. And   I don't know what happened. But  I don't know. So I want you to fix it, please  if you had time. Do you have time now, or you ?
Tomorrow morning? Yes. Yeah,  but, you know,   window broken.
Why? Like,  I don't know. Somebody could came in, you know?
 but 
  if somebody sneaked in 
you know, took something off, .
.
 do you know some  windows company or fixing company or anything?
.
Are they? .
Do you know any like  doing every job in twenty-four hours. Or, no?
.
O K. Good. Thank you.

.
Sure, sure.
Yeah. .
 Yeah.  bring to where? 
 room? Or?
O K. Thank you. Thank you very much.
My number is  
 
.
.
See you later then. Thank you very much.
. .
Like what kind ?
 the biggest problem was my language problem. ,
it was tough. It was tough to listening and   talk to.   but     I hosted  with my host family, and my host family was very nice.  and, especially my host dad was correcting my English everyday and every day.
And  he is good,  character to me really, and,    now I have problem talking in English.
  actually, I'm not talking in English so like   four or five years, like talk in usual, you know?
But,  actually I'm studying Spanish now  like five years.
So  to English, and,   when I want to talk in English, my Spanish came out.
 it's tough to talk in English now.
.
 both.
Sure.
.
Last week?
. O K.  I'm the man here?  or
?
.
O K.  I cannot die, so 
should be somebody.
 last week,   some guy was driving in a car. And,   when I was sitting in a motorbike and driving it,   my friend was calling. And  I knew that it was bad, but  I couldn't wait it, so took it, you know? And  I was driving with my mobile phone   in my ears.  and, after that, like a minutes, it happened.   I crashed, and  car and my mobile phone  broke, too, you know? And   I knew it's  bad, too. But, you know,  I was so mad at him, and,  with my broken my mobile phone because     I didn't take any note for my memories and numbers. So  I said the guy, "What did you do with my mobile phone?". You know?    the bike was not that problem.  but    it's usual thing but he was  mad at me, too.   we called the police, and  policeman came, and  the guy said, " he was talking on the phone and driving it.", you know? And, yeah,   after he said that, I couldn't say  anything, you know?  just standing and  doing nothing.   but I was so mad. But, after that,   the guy and policeman  went away, and  I was all by myself with my bike. But  I didn't know it was so bad, but I couldn't move any.  I needed to call  my JAF or something like that or  company. And my bike was gone with truck, and I was all by myself now. 
Yeah.
Sure.
.
In a train?
They shouldn't use it, or,  you know, someone talks really loudly,
and someone talks really . But,      if you didn't have time, or it's really important phone call,
it's not bad to take it. 
you should say, that  "I'm in a train. I'm gonna call you back later, please.". So  they could understand it, you know?   and   it's bad thing  time goes first and business goes first and anything. , if you miss the, like, point,  they go away.  and   I don't know, but,   actually I don't turn off my mobile.   so  I don't know, it really affect to somebody. Or,   actually, they shouldn't talk loud, or they shouldn't talk long 
just  brief note and say something or "I'll call you back later, O K, and please.".  they would understand.
 my friend does,
 so do I. 
Yeah.
Sure.
.
When?  next April.
Yeah.
  until my retiring,    I don't know what can I do. 
I wanna do a lot of things,
and I wanna learn a lot of thing
and, you know, have my family and kids. And  that's all I wanna do.
And watch the kids growing, you know?
That should be nice.
Yes.
. 
Thank you very much.
