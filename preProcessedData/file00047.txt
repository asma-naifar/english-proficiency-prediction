And <R>I am</R> I am a kind of assistant to some lawyers and patent lawyers and paralegals. Yeah, <SC>and</SC> so <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> assistant means, <F>er</F> making copies <laughter>and</laughter> clean up the room and <F>er</F> <SC>look for</SC> <F>er</F> looking for <F>er</F> everything <F>er</F> required by lawyers. So I'm always, <F>er</F> going to court or <F>er</F> lawyer's association. That's my job.<F>Well</F> <F>er</F> because <F>er</F> a friend of mine from <H pn="school name1">XXX03</H> <F>er</F> used to work there, and <F>er</F> <SC>she introduced to</SC> she introduced me to the office, because now I'm studying at night class, <R>so</R> <F>er</F> <SC>so</SC> <F>mhmm</F> and <F>er</F> I was looking for a job <F>er</F> near college. <R>And</R> and I have to go to college at night, so the job was <F>er</F> <F>er</F> daytime job. So I decided to work there.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Well</F> <F>urr</F> I don't think I can cope with it <.></.> this age. <SC>So</SC> <R>but</R> <F>mhmm</F> <.></.> <R>but</R> <R>but</R> but <SC>always</SC> I always <F>er</F> concentrate on what I'm doing now. So I think that's the way to handle with <.></.> both role <.></.> maybe.<F>Well</F> I like watching soccer game, <F>er</F> because my hometown is <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>. So I'm very big fan of <H pn="others2">XXX05</H>. So <R>I</R> <R>I often</R> I often go to the stadium and also <R>watching</R> watching games on T V. And my husband <F>er</F> also big fan of soccer games, so <R>we</R> we enjoy seeing it. And <F>er</F> what else? <F>Mhmm</F> and <R>I like listen</R> I like listening to music, especially rock music from overseas. Yeah.<F>Urmm</F> <F>well</F> actually <R>I like</R> I like watching <R>any</R> any kinds of sports. But <SC>specia</SC> the reason why I specially <F>err</F> <R>like</R> <F>er</F> like soccer is <F>er</F> my hometown is <H pn="others1">XXX04</H>, and <F>err</F> <.></.> the town <SC>is not so famous</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> was not so famous before. But after the club came, <SC>it</SC> <F>mhmm</F> <R>we</R> <R>we have</R> <SC>we have</SC> <F>er</F> we could feel a kind of pride and <F>er</F> <.></.> so, we found a joy. So, <F>mhmm</F> <R>I started to</R> I started to watch game <R>and</R> and <SC>naturally <F>er</F> <R>my</R> <F>mhmm</F> my</SC> <F>mhmm</F> <laughter>naturally</laughter> <SC>I became</SC> <R>I</R> I became to <F>mhm</F> love soccer.O K. <F>Er</F> <R>this is a</R> this is a <.></.> room in a hotel. And <.></.> <F>oh</F> sorry, it's not. Yeah, I think it's a restaurant. And there are three tables, <R>and</R> and there are three couples and <SC>two server</SC> two <R>waiter</R> waiter are serving. And <R>in the</R> in the middle of the restaurant, the couple is <F>er</F> drinking wine. And <F>err</F> the man is <.></.> testing the wine and saying something to the waiter. Maybe he is sommelier. And <R>he</R> he show the bottle to the man. I guess he is explaining something. And <F>er</F> the couple, <F>er</F> they dressed very nicely. <CO><R>And</R> <.></.> <F>mhmm</F> <R>and</R> <.></.> <R>and</R> <F>well</F> and</CO>. <.></.>O K?<.></.> You mean, in our free time?<F>Er</F> like this? <.></.> <F>Well</F> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I sometimes eating out with my husband. But we don't get dressed like this. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <..></..><nvs>laughter</nvs> It's very different from restaurant to we often go. We often go to a kind of family style restaurant <.></.> such as Denny's or Skylark. So I wish I could <SC>go like</SC> go to a nice restaurant like this.<F>Well</F> <SC>fir</SC> at first, it's very cheap and they served very quickly. And, <F>er</F> most of the cases, <F>er</F> that kind of restaurant is in suburb, so <SC>people are very</SC> <F>er</F> people can go there very easily. I think they are good point of family-type restaurant.O K.<F>Er</F> <F>well</F> <F>er</F> I have a reservation ticket, but <F>er</F> I had a accident and <R>I couldn't</R> <F>er</F> <SC>I couldn't go</SC> <R>I</R> <R>I couldn't</R> I couldn't <R>ge</R> get on the train I reserved. So <R>I'd like to</R> <F>er</F> I'd like to paid back <F>er</F> <R>to</R> to the ticket. Is it possible?<F>Oh</F> but <F>er</F> the accident was caused by J R, so <R>I</R> I couldn't helped. So I think this is a kind of special case. So could you ask your boss?<F>Er</F> I see. <F>Er</F> <SC>maybe it was a</SC> <F>er</F> <R>may</R> <F>er</F> maybe <SC>I got a</SC> <.></.> I got something to prove from police because it was a suicide accident. <CO>So</CO>. <.></.><F>Oh</F>.O K. So <F>urr</F> <.></.> O K. <F>Err</F> <.></.> <R>once</R> <F>er</F> once <R>I</R> I buy the new ticket, <SC>so</SC> but <SC>I really need</SC> <F>er</F> I really wanna <R>pay</R> pay back for the ticket, so here is my address. So <F>er</F> <SC>let</SC> <F>er</F> <R>could you</R> <R>could you</R> could you give me a call later?Yes, I have. <SC>I have</SC> <F>er</F> <R>I</R> I have been to <??></??> the United States and France and Italy, Singapore and England.<F>Well</F> <F>er</F> at first, <R>I like</R> I like taking airplanes. So <R>most</R> most of the people <R>are</R> are complaining about food or <F>er</F> seat <.></.> on <?>the</?> planes, but I love the atmosphere, yeah. <SC>It's a</SC> <R>I</R> I can feel like <F>er</F> "<F>Oh</F> I'm going abroad.".So I'm very excited. So I like the atmosphere. And I like the food because I don't have to serve, I don't have to cook. So it's very comfortable. <R>So</R> <F>mhmm</F> so that's <R>one</R> one of the reason I like traveling abroad. And <SC>after I arrived at</SC> after I arrive <SC>at the pla</SC> <F>er</F> at <F>er</F> foreign country, <F>er</F> <.></.> <SC>it is</SC> <F>mhmm</F> <R>I can</R> I can enjoy what I can't experience in Japan. So everything is very fun to me.No, <OL>I'm sorry, I have not</OL>.O K.Yes. <F>Er</F> <R>one</R> one day last week, <F>er</F> I went to a department store <SC>to buy my</SC> to buy <R>a</R> a tie for my husband. <SC>And I</SC> but I didn't know, <F>er</F> what kind of design is good for him. So I asked the clerk. Then <F>eh</F> <R>he</R> he recommended, <F>er</F> <R>green</R> green one to me. <R>And</R> and <R>I</R> I paid for it, and I asked him to wrap as a gift. <SC>So</SC> <R>and</R> <R>and</R> and <R>I</R> I paid two thousand yen to him. Then <F>er</F> <R>I would like to</R> I would like to buy <R>other</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> other things for me, so I asked him <SC>where is the</SC> <SC>where</SC> <F>er</F> <R>wha</R> what floor is for women's clothes. <?>So</?> he said <SC>it's <SC>third</SC> thir</SC> it's third floor. So <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <F>mhm</F> I go up to the stairs to <R>the</R> the third floor.Yeah.<F>Urr</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> <.></.> <F>mhmm</F> <R>I think</R> I think <SC>it's a</SC> <F>er</F> the number of <F>er</F> year-end gifts is decreasing because the most of young people don't like that custom. And actually I don't do it, so. <.></.> But maybe <SC>the number is <SC?>not so</SC?> <?>not</?></SC> <R>the</R> the number is not so big, but I guess <R>it will</R> it will continue. <.></.> But personally I don't like the custom <.></.> because it's waste of money. Because, for example, I give you the gift and then <SC>you gi</SC> you will give me the gift, so <SC>it's</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can't understand their idea.<F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I have to go to college, because I have some classes tonight.<F>Urr</F> <F>well</F> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <R>I want</R> I want to study English education, <SC>so</SC> but I graduate from a vocational school, so, <F>mhm</F> after I enter the company, my interest about English became bigger. But <SC>I not</SC> <R>I</R> <SC>I rea</SC> one day I realized I didn't study a lot. <R>So</R> so I decided to go to college again. <R>So</R> <R>so</R> <F>mhm</F> so now, I'm taking, <F>er</F> <F>er</F> some lessons for teachers. <R>So</R> so I would like to take a certification for <.></.> English teaching.That's my plan.Yes.<F>Oh</F> <OL>thank you</OL>.Thank you very much.Thank you.
