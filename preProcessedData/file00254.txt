This is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking. <F>Erm</F> I joined your <F>erm</F> <.></.> gorgeous <.></.> tour, <SC>what</SC> <F>erm</F> but in fact <F>erm</F> when I <.></.> joined the tour, it wasn't gorgeous at all. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Why? <F>Oh</F> because <F>umm</F> I've heard that <R>we could s</R> <F>erm</F> I could stay in <F>erm</F> very <.></.> <F>erm</F> excellent hotels like Hilton or <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> like that. But <.></.> <F>erm</F> <R>when I <.></.> arr</R> when I arrived at the hotel, it wasn't <F>erm</F> like that. It was <SC>o</SC> like <F>er</F> <.></.> only small room and orthodox <.></.> <F>erm</F> <R>dec</R> decoration <SC>in</SC> <.></.> and no separated bath and <.></.> <F>er</F> shower room, so. <R>And</R> <.></.> and what else? <F>Erm</F> <.></.> <R>no</R> <R>no</R> <SC>no sss</SC> <.></.> no gowns and no slippers <SC>or</SC> and the reception's attitude towards guest were not so <.></.> <F>erm</F> appropriate like <F>erm</F> <.></.> you know, <SC>top</SC> <R>good</R> <.></.> good hotels.<F>Erm</F>. No. This is <F>oh</F> my first time.<F>Oh</F>. <SC>Because</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <F>well</F> that's because <R>I</R> <.></.> I <.></.> chose your company <R>and</R> <.></.> and I <.></.> asked <.></.> you <R>to</R> to <.></.> reserve that hotel. <R>So</R> so, I thought that this is the way <R>to</R> to tell you. Not direct to them but direct to you <SC>is much more</SC> <.></.> be much better and <nvs>cough</nvs> much polite.<nvs>cough</nvs> Yes. <F>Umm</F>. <.></.> <F>Well</F>. <nvs>cough</nvs> Excuse me. <F>Erm</F>. <R>I</R> <R>I</R> <.></.> <SC>I'd like to</SC> <.></.> I'd like you to give me back some money. <.></.> Because I couldn't accept appropriate service there.O K.<laughter>Honeymoon trip</laughter>. O K. <SC>By m</SC> <F>er</F> about myself? <nvs>laughter</nvs> O K. <F>Er</F>. We went to Hawaii. <F>Um</F> <F>er</F> Oahu and Maui Island.<.></.> Yeah.<F>Umm</F>. Since I visited Oahu Island before <F>erm</F> <.></.> with my family. <SC>So</SC> <R>and</R> <.></.> and Maui was my first time to visit. So, Maui was the most impressive place to me.<F>Er</F> <.></.> <SC>unlike Oahu</SC> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>like</SC> unlike busy street <.></.> like <F>er</F> <SC>Kaua</SC> Waikiki Street in Oahu, <F>erm</F> Maui is <F>er</F> very <.></.> quiet <.></.> and <.></.> much more nature. So, <F>um</F> that is <F>er</F> <.></.> thing I liked.O K.O K. One day last week, <F>erm</F> I went to the department store. And <F>erm</F> since <.></.> the next day was my husband's birthday, <SC>I chose <F>er</F> some</SC> <F>uh</F> I chose <.></.> one very nice necktie for him. And I paid <.></.> <SC>the</SC> that fee to the clerk and <nvs>laughter</nvs> I was <.></.> on my way to go out from the department store. But at that time, <R>I</R> <.></.> <R>I</R> <.></.> I saw some <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> <R>final sale</R> <.></.> <F>er</F> final sale <F>umm</F> poster <.></.> at the <R>shoe st</R> shoe store. And <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <R>I must</R> I must <laughter>buy some</laughter> nice shoes for me, too. <SC>And</SC> but <.></.> <R>nex</R> <R>nex</R> <.></.> next moment, <F>erm</F> I found <R>much more</R> <.></.> <F>umm</F> <R>much more better</R> <SC>much more</SC> better attention. That says fifty percent off. So, <SC>I went into the</SC> <.></.> I went into that clothes store and I chose one blouse for me and I bought it. <R>And</R> <.></.> <R>and</R> <.></.> <F>oh</F> and also <F>umm</F> some nice <JP>one piece</JP>. And <.></.> finally, I went out of the store <SC>with my</SC> with this many <.></.> paper bags <R>filled with</R> <.></.> filled with <F>erm</F> lots of items.<CO>Store like a <R>Fa</R> Family <R>Mar</R> Mart or</CO>. O K. <F>Well</F> <.></.> <F>er</F> one <.></.> big difference is, <F>er</F> <.></.> the time they open is so different. <F>Erm</F> department stores usually <SC>st</SC> open at ten a.m. in the morning and <F>erm</F> usually <SC>finish</SC> they close at <F>er</F> eight or nine <.></.> <F>er</F> in the evening. But on the other hand <F>er</F> in the small convenient store <R>o</R> <SC>open</SC> sometimes open twenty-four hours. And so, <R>it's</R> it's more convenient <R>for</R> for customers. <F>Hmm</F>. But on the other hand, department store <F>em</F> have a <R>va</R> variety of goods <F>er</F> from <.></.> food to <F>er</F> clothes. <.></.> <R>On</R> on the other hand, <F>er</F> <F>em</F> small convenient store doesn't <SC>ha</SC> sell <.></.> clothes or <F>um</F> lots of other items that department store sell.Tonight? <F>Well</F> <R>tonight I</R> <F>umm</F> tonight <R>I</R> I don't know. <F>Erm</F> I don't have any <SC>sp</SC> particular <F>erm</F> plan. But <F>erm</F> <.></.> this <F>er</F> afternoon, <SC>my</SC> some of my friends <SC>vis</SC> will visit my house <OL>and we'll have lunch</OL>.Yeah, <SC>I ha</SC> <OL><laughter>I must cook first</laughter></OL>.<F>Well</F> actually I've not decided <laughter>yet</laughter>. But <R>I</R> I think I'm gonna make some pasta and some <F>erm</F> vegetable soup and <OL>salad</OL>.Yeah.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.You, too. <OL>Thank you very much</OL>.
