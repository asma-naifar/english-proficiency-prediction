So, <.></.> it was <.></.> fun. <F>Hm</F>. And <.></.> because it was a farewell party for me, it was <F>er</F> <SC>kind of moving</SC> so moving for me. And <F>umm</F> <.></.> it was a good memory, also. <F>Umm</F> I liked it very much.O K. <.></.> One day last week, <F>umm</F> Mister Ito <F>umm</F> <.></.> went to the <.></.> station and took a <.></.> train as usual. But <F>er</F> on a platform, <F>umm</F> <.></.> by accident, he dropped <SC>her</SC> <F>uh</F> his briefcase <.></.> <F>erm</F> <.></.> from the platform to the <R>rai</R> <.></.> railway. <F>Er</F> <.></.> <SC>he blamed to</SC> <.></.> he blamed <.></.> a man who was standing next to him <.></.> for <R>the</R> <.></.> the accident, because <.></.> <F>er</F> <SC>the man's elbow <.></.> was</SC> <.></.> <SC>no, elbow</SC> <.></.> <F>eh</F> the man hit <.></.> Mister Ito with his elbow <??></??> <F>urm</F> <.></.> And the briefcase dropped off <.></.> from the platform. But while they were <nvs>cough</nvs> trying to pick up the <.></.> briefcase, the train came <.></.> in. And <.></.> Mister Ito was almost <.></.> hit by the <.></.> train. But fortunately, Mister Ito was safe on the platform. And finally, <.></.> <F>erm</F> staff from the <.></.> station <F>erm</F> <.></.> <SC>go</SC> went down to the <.></.> railway and picked up his briefcase. So <.></.> finally, Mister Ito could <F>erm</F> <.></.> take back his briefcase safely. But <F>erm</F> <.></.> people should be very careful <F>erm</F> on the platform, because something like this <F>erm</F> <.></.> may happen to everyone.<F>Erm</F> <.></.> <F>hmm</F>. O K. I like driving car very much. So, <F>umm</F> <.></.> I like <.></.> going somewhere by car. <.></.> But <F>er</F> I think it depends. <.></.> If we <.></.> go to <.></.> downtown or <R>other</R> other areas, we <F>umm</F> should go by train, because there are <.></.> few parking lots <.></.> and <.></.> maybe road must be very crowded. <F>Umm</F>. And train is very punctual in Japan and cheap <.></.> than highway <.></.> fare. So, <.></.> <F>umm</F> I always <SC>took a</SC> take a train to go to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> so <.></.> <SC>I an</SC> <F>uh</F> my husband and I and my parents <F>umm</F> maybe make a <.></.> short trip <.></.> <OL><R>arou</R></OL><R>around</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>umm</F> <.></.> around the area. <OL><??></??></OL>.So, <F>hm</F> <R>that's</R> <F>er</F> <.></.> <F>umm</F> that's <F>er</F> <.></.> maybe a plan for my Golden Week.<F>Hm</F><nvs>laughter</nvs><OL>Thank you</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Thank you.<F>Oh</F> you're welcome.
