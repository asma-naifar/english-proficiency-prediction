Good morning.
My name is .
I'm from .
  I moved to   about  two years ago  so,  I also,  not about    very much.  but  it's a nice place  to live.  there still are paddy field around my house. And  there are many small stores and   parks. So, I like  the place.
. I took    train. And it took about fifteen minutes.   I think it's very   
 actually, . I don't have any  job now. I  go to a  school to learn interpretation and translation. So,   four class a week.
.  .     I  interested in translation first. And  I'd studied translation about   a year before I started  studying   interpretation. Because I'm not good at  listening English. So,  that's why I  started translation first. But   as I learn  translation, I thought I  need   more  skill related to interpretation,  such as    interpretation speed and vocabularies. So I started    interpretation  classes, too.
.
  mostly,   watching T V and reading books, listening music and house chores.
. I like   watching news now.   and some other  programs about everyday's information.
O K.   this is   ski , I don't know.   people are  skiing  on  mountain.   And  some people  are skiing and    some are  playing    snowboard. And some are playing with  snowballs   throwing to each other.    there is a lodge   near the  ski course and two people are  taking  coffee or something.  the sky is very clear. People are very enjoying themselves. 
No. Never. 
.
No.
 I've never  been to  skiing.
 I think that's a little bit scary. 
And I don't like  cold weather.
.
My ideal vacation?   ideal vacation.   my ideal vacation is    like to spend my vacation near the beach  with a very    warm and dry  weather.      maybe  .
.  And  so,     I'd like to do what I want to do,
 vacation.

O K.
Hello?   I'm .

I'm very sorry. My mother had a car accident. And  she is O K. But I had to  take care of her and    make some arrangement to      have her  car  repaired and take her to the hospital, so. And  I was so    nervous   and very     upset, so I couldn't make a phone call    last night. And  very sorry.
.
 I'm terribly sorry.  I wish I    could  make a phone call. But  I was so   upset and nervous, so.  .
. . she just  drove into a bush.   so, no other people were involved. So, that's   very fortunate. . But  she had a   slight injury on her neck, so   then I  had to take her to the hospital and   make arrangement to, for some  medical tests for her.  so,   she was also very  nervous and upset. And  I had to take care of her.
.
O K.
. I'm sorry.
O K. .
Partying?  maybe,   I think I  like it. Because I've never  ,  attended  not many .
Party? .  It was a farewell party.  .  It's part of ?
 So, it was  actually a  farewell party for me.   when I   left my  company. . So,  it was  fun. . And  because it was a farewell party for me, it was   so moving for me. And   it was a good memory, also.  I liked it very much.
O K.  One day last week,  Mister Ito   went to the  station and took a  train as usual. But  on a platform,   by accident, he dropped   his briefcase    from the platform to the   railway.     he blamed  a man who was standing next to him  for   the accident, because        the man hit  Mister Ito with his elbow    And the briefcase dropped off  from the platform. But while they were  trying to pick up the  briefcase, the train came  in. And  Mister Ito was almost  hit by the  train. But fortunately, Mister Ito was safe on the platform. And finally,   staff from the  station    went down to the  railway and picked up his briefcase. So  finally, Mister Ito could   take back his briefcase safely. But   people should be very careful  on the platform, because something like this   may happen to everyone.
  . O K. I like driving car very much. So,   I like  going somewhere by car.  But  I think it depends.  If we  go to  downtown or  other areas, we  should go by train, because there are  few parking lots  and  maybe road must be very crowded. . And train is very punctual in Japan and cheap  than highway  fare. So,   I always  take a train to go to  so    my husband and I and my parents  maybe make a  short trip  
     around the area. .
So,      that's   maybe a plan for my Golden Week.


.
 Thank you.
 you're welcome.
