My name is .  ?
O K.
I'm very fine. Thank you.
. Friday, I'm very busy to prepare for  the weekend dinner. Because my husband  works five day in a week  and he stays at home Saturday and Sunday. So, I prepare    more delicious meals for him.
.   when I take a dinner, I  very much favorite French dish. But it's very difficult to cook. So, my  usual  home dinner may be  Japanese or Chinese or some ethnic  food. 
 I'm almost Internet junky.  I'm at my computer.
. English education site is  the best. And I have  many Internet mail friend in Europe, Asia. So, I write  many e-mails in English. It's very difficult  for me and it takes a lot of time.
. There are many  pen pal  site. And I   access that seeking pen pal site. And I find   Japanese    I can't . And   I found people who are interesting in Japanese people.
.  Many of them are young. So, they are interested in Japanese animation or Japanese popular song,  visual rock band and. So,  I read many   topics. And   I write to them .
.  Mister and Mrs So-and-so  went to the French restaurant, because    they'd like to celebrate their  marriage     memorial day.          Mister  So-and-so  ordered a special wine for celebrate their  memorial day. But Mrs So-and-so  doesn't drink  wine.  Perhaps she's prefer  to take some delicious  or so, I think.         I hope the husband  more take care about  his wife.
 . Not so . And at night, today  is my  wedding . And,     I say to my husband and just    it's very important for us, our children's .
