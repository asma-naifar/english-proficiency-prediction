Because <F>uum</F> <R>I didn't have</R> I didn't have to have anything <F>uum</F> because I wasn't here. So now I don't have <SC>no</SC> anything to do <OL>in my office</OL>.New job. <F>Um</F> <?>development</?>. So before I went to the United States, <F>err</F> I go to see my client or insurance company, but now <R>I have to</R> I have to make <R>some</R> <F>uum</F> some new business model about insurance or guarantee or something. So that's my new job so.Nothing.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Um</F> actually, I've never studied about this kind of <SC>new pra</SC> <SC>new model</SC> new business model, but <F>uum</F> I don't know why I was chosen <laughter>as</laughter> <F>uum</F> the position <R>but</R> but my boss and my co-worker suggested <SC>to my boss</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> to my big boss to do this kind of job. I don't know why. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter>.<F>Um</F> sorry?<F>Uuum</F> actually, <F>uum</F> before I went to the United States, I didn't have any time to do something except for job, but now I have time, so I want to go some musicals or some performance <?>to see</?> because <F>um</F> <SC>I have</SC> I had never been to such kind of shows and musicals or plays before I went to the United States. But while I was in New York, after I left from Indianapolis when I went to New York to see my co-worker and my clients, and then I saw some Broadway Musical and, do you know Stump? <F>Err</F> make noise by newspapers or beep <F>uum</F> plastic bag or something, that kind of show. I saw that and I'm just interested in <R>th</R> this kind of performances now, so I wanna go some performance or plays or something <SC>in Tokyo</SC> even in Tokyo.<OL><F>Mm</F> so</OL>So do you know Stump? <CO>Stump is kind of</CO>. <F>Uum</F>.Yeah. Stump is <F>uum</F> kind of music but <F>uum</F> this music was made by just noise like <R>clap your hands or</R> <F>uum</F> clap your hands or coughing or something or <R>scratching</R> scratching <R>some</R> <F>uum</F> some bottles or everything. So the music <F>uum</F> that was made by noise. <SC>It's very</SC> it's very impressive, <R>very</R> very exciting <F>um</F>.<laughter>Yes</laughter>.O K.O K. <R>This is a</R> <F>uum</F> this is a classroom and <SC>it</SC> I think it's a mathematics class. And it is summer because almost all students <SC>have</SC> wears short-sleeved shirt. And the teacher is woman and wearing <R>glass</R> glasses. And half of them, no, just two student are very <F>um</F> hard to study about <??></??> mathematics or something. But almost all students are not so eager to study. Because some of them having chewing gum, and some of them chatting and some of them <SC>didn't</SC> <F>er</F> doesn't hear what teacher says and listen to the music and drinking something. So it's not good class, I think.<OL><F>Uum</F></OL> <R>to</R> totally bad. Terrible class. Because <F>err</F> my class has about almost ten students, and half of them are from Saudi Arabia. And they are not so eager to study, because they have a lot of money, so they came here to <R>just</R> just play. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>Just time consume</SC> <R>just</R> just consume. So they are not so eager to study so almost all Saudi Arabian, chatting each other in the class or <SC>they want</SC> they didn't hear anything what teacher says <laughter>or</laughter> actually they hear some music or something. So I don't like the class. <CO><OL>This kind of</OL></CO>.Of course, <SC>teacher tried to do</SC> <F>um</F> teacher <R>tried to stop</R> tried to stop what they did, chatting or listening to music or something.

And I have lecture in Chicago and <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> after the lecture I went to New York. And New York was a kind of exciting city, and Indianapolis, not exciting city. So New York is very <SC>good city</SC> <F>um</F> interesting city for me, because it's <F>umm</F> similar to Tokyo. So I can go everywhere to see some musical, I go to drink or something. So actually, I hadn't <SC>drink</SC> drunk <F>uum</F> in Indianapolis because <SC>I have to</SC> I had to drive every time. So New York was kind of exciting city, so. <F>Uum</F> <SC>New York</SC> <F>er</F> actually, I lost my weight in United States because <R>I don't like</R> <R>I don't like</R> <laughter>I don't like</laughter><OL>United States</OL> food. So in New York, I have a lot of Japanese food. But in Indianapolis, it's not so common, so <SC>I can</SC> <R>I</R> I found some of them but <F>uum</F> it's not so good for me. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>O K.<OL><F>Uhu</F></OL>.O K.<F>Uhu</F>.<OL>One day last week</OL>.O K. <SC><R>One day last week</R> <nvs>laughter</nvs> one day last week <R>my</R> <F>uum</F> <SC>my sister</SC> O K my sister</SC> one day last week, my sister went to the <JP>depaato</JP>. <F>Um</F> she said <F>uun</F> she didn't have any purpose to go to <JP>depaato</JP>, but <F>uum</F> <R>just</R> <F>uum</F> just on the way, she went to <JP>depaato</JP>.

So first, she <SC>bought</SC> had that tie. And after that she paid <SC>by</SC> the money by cash and <SC>on the way <R>to</R> to go back from</SC> on the way to leave from the department store, she found <F>erm</F> some bargain sale of shoes. <SC>And then after the she</SC> and then <R>she bought</R> <SC>she bought new sho</SC> she bought shoes <R>and</R> <SC>and after</SC> and then she found another bargain of some shirt.
