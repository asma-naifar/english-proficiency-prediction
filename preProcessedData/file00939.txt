I usually  watch T V
or listen to music   or   do my homework.

 I prefer to go shopping to Shinjuku or Shibuya or somewhere.
   but  if it's get dark,    my house is far from here

   walking around the park.

And    one of the student in front of the teacher    is listening to her very eagerly but  the boy next to him    seem      and the girl next to the boy is  playing with her cell phone.
And    other students also talking and drinking and      totally they seems rude for her.
Favorite class of university?
Yes.   before I came here, I take  seminar class.
It is about  Japanese literature.
But  we taught it in English.
And  the member of the seminar are  about six student. And maybe two of us    had lived foreign county so they can speak English so fluently.
And the teacher is American.

Maybe there are many foreign movie.
 .     foreign movie seems maybe more interesting for me.
Recently, I like action movie.
For example?  during summer vacation,   I watched  " Driven". The  main cast was Sylvester Stallone.
And it is the  movie about    car racing.
And  there are car crash and   racing,
   many explosion and  I was very excited .

One day last week, a  woman went shopping to a   department store. Then,   she planned to  buy the birthday present  for her husband. And she bought a necktie.
   but    on the way back to home,  she  found the shoes  were on the sale.
 So  she thought ". Lucky".  Then she bought one
because it is  thirty percent off.
Then  she also found that the clothes    she have wanted to buy
was on sale. And it is fifty percent.
 " yes. I take this one".
Then   she bought many many things and    now she has no money.
My birthday is May twenties.
This year?
 I went to my friend's house and  there are three of my friends and  I made them .
  one of my friends
 made   birthday cake 
 we ate it. That was very delicious.
And    the other girl  gave me a present.
And other two girls didn't  give me any present because they didn't have .
But that was O K.
 I was so happy to be celebrated. And   we stayed  until late at night.
 We talk much.
 so all of us    go to different university so   about our university and our friends
 many many thing.
     we were  a  friend when we were high school.
.
  yes. 

sometime for friend
and sometime for family.
 Christmas?    especially Christmas?
.     at first,   I decide      up to how much I can use for the present.
Then,     I prefer  more  practical one.
   the latest present  I give to my friend was watch.
 I thought it is very practical
 useful.
 but   less than five thousand yen.
.
.
.
O K. I plan to go back to my hometown
   spend  some days.  but actually, my mother's hometown is in .
 maybe we will spend New Year's Day in .
But after that,       some winter vacation days  would be left so I want to go back  my hometown in  again.
 maybe   one week or so.

Thank you.
