The same as chicken, frankly speaking. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.<OL>Price was different</OL>. Of course, service or atmosphere <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> it's very nice.Yeah. For us, a little bit <R>too</R> too nice. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>My pleasure.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Mm</F> <F>hm</F>.O K.Yeah.<F>Oh</F> yeah. <F>Ah</F> I joined one <F>er</F> travel tour to Las Vegasand <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> of course, <F>er</F> <R>you</R> <R>you</R> <F>mm</F> <SC>you said</SC> <F>er</F> you advertised<OL>this tour was</OL> very nice.<OL>And <SC>very <R>lux</R> luxury</SC></OL> <F>eh</F> <F>mm</F> <F>er</F> <?>a lot of</?> very luxury feeling I can enjoy.Yeah. But <F>eh</F> unfortunately, we have some <F>mm</F> problem. Actually, three problems. One is <F>eh</F> <SC>meat</SC> quality of meat or so. So first day, it's not so bad, but second day, <SC>it was</SC> <SC>it's</SC> <R>I</R> I was very surprised. <SC>It was</SC> <SC>it seemed it was</SC> <F>eh</F> it seemed a kind of vegetable day <laughter>or so</laughter>. So, small meat, <R?>wh</R?> <?>what</?> probably chicken meat or so I can, but <R>I went</R> <F>eh</F> we went to U S A, so I expected <F>er</F> to eat or so, other such kind of very expensive meat,<OL>I expected</OL> but unfortunately, I didn't enjoy one day. And so next day, <F>well</F> <R>so <F>uh</F> I</R> you know, so I didn't enjoy any beef or so.<F>Eh</F> chicken is <SC>expensive</SC> <F>eh</F> more expensive than the beef? I don't think <laughter>so</laughter>, even if in U S A.And second point is room. Of course, room size itself <SC>not</SC> no problem. But how to say, <SC>how</SC> room <R>keep</R> keeper or condition <F>er</F> it was not so good. For example, <F>eh</F> I couldn't get hot water. <F>Er</F> <R>p</R> probably <R>withi</R> within one liter or so <F>eh</F> when I opened the <F>er</F> it starts <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> I forgot the exact <??></??> <SC>exact</SC> when <SC>we</SC> I try to have <SC>wa</SC> hot water or so in the bath or so, nothing, so shower, I have to wait five minutes, ten minutes. <F>Oh</F>. But finally, a little bit warm. Of course, Las Vegas itself <SC>not so warm</SC> <F>eh</F> not so coldbut <F>oh</F> I like to have hot water, <OL>close</OL> to forty centigrade but I didn't.Third one? <F>Oh</F>. Third one. Very <R>I</R> I expect very, how to say, luxury tour, <R>so <F>uu</F> our</R> how to say, <R>our</R> <F>eh</F> our <F>mm</F> group member should be, how to say, very <??></??> very high society or luxury people I expected. Actually, <F>eh</F> <R>it's</R> <SC>it's</SC> <F>eh</F> I suppose it was <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> group or so.<OL>I was very</OL> surprised. <F>Erm</F> so I went to Las Vegas with them, then, <R>its</R> its looks like, how say, discount tour, economic tour or so.<OL><SC>I</SC> so</OL>, I didn't expect such kind of thing.<OL><??></??></OL> Yeah.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Ah</F>.Frankly <laughter>speaking</laughter>, not yet. But <R>I</R> <SC>I mentioned such kind of</SC> <F>eh</F> I expressed such kind of <F>eh</F> argument to <F>uh</F> the tour conductor or so. I forgot <F>ur</F> his name or so, actually. <F>Uh</F> probably <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H> <JP>san</JP>? <F>Oh</F> sorry. <F>Er</F> excuse me. <F>Er</F> probably she. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah.<OL><F>Hm</F> <R>any</R></OL> anyway, so I didn't <??></??> mention such kind of thing to local <??></??> staff or so.<OL><CO>But</CO></OL>. <F>Eh</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Oh</F> but I don't think <F>er</F> <R>they</R> they were charged as same <F>uh</F> cost as myself.But <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>oh</F> <SC>my</SC> of course, you can say so, but I was very surprised. <SC>So anyway</SC> so, that kind of <OL>group</OL>,only <R>our</R> <SC>our</SC> myself and my wife <F>eh</F> is another kind group or so.<F>Wow</F>. "What happened?". My wife complained to me, actually, yeah.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. Yeah.<OL>Yeah</OL>, please. Yeah.<F>Oh</F> later?<OL>O K</OL>. <R>When</R> when?O K, so, to my home?<OL>O K</OL>. I'm looking forward to your phone.<OL>Thank you</OL>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>.<F>Eh</F> <laughter>no, frankly speaking</laughter>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yeah.<OL><F>Mm</F> <F>hmm</F></OL>. <F>Eh</F> you mean, yeah, <SC>argumen</SC> <F>em</F> <R>complain</R> <F>mm</F> complain? Yeah. Many times. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F> <F>mm</F> anyway, so, at first, <F>eh</F> I try to hear or listen to his comment or so, and also, what happened or so. Then, <F>eh</F> probably <F>er</F> <R>I can</R> I can guess, "<F>oh</F> <SC>how should</SC> <F>eh</F> how <SC>can</SC> I <R>can</R> can solve the problem or <F>uh</F> this argument?".Yeah. <F>Oh</F> and of course, sometimes, <nvs>laughter</nvs> it's very difficult <SC>because of</SC> because we didn't do any mistake or so. Sometimes <SC>their mis</SC> based on their mistake or their colleague's mistake, they got mad.And they complain to us, so in that case, we couldn't help, yeah, or so.Yeah. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>My pleasure</laughter></OL>.<F>Mm</F> <F>hmm</F>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Oh</F> O K. <F>Mm</F>. One day last week. <F>Mhm</F>. Yeah. <F>Mh-hmm</F>. <.></.> Yeah.Yeah, yeah. <F>Eh</F> so, <F>mm</F> <F>oh</F> <SC>last week</SC> <F>eh</F> one day last week, my wife went to the department store to have <F>er</F> my birthday present. <F>Er</F> I like <F>er</F>necktie very much, so <R>he</R> <SC>he choiced</SC> <F>er</F> he picked up <SC>one</SC> green-colored one, and anyway, the <SC>he</SC> <SC>she bought for me</SC> she bought it for me. And she paid <SC>a little bit cost <laughter>money</laughter></SC> big money. <F>Er</F> but <F>er</F> usually, <SC>I said</SC> <SC>I request</SC> I ask her to use credit card. <F>Mm</F> because very dangerous to bring a lot of money or so. <F>Er</F> but after that, <F>er</F> <SC>she</SC> of course, <F>ur</F> she went to department store. So, just she want to do <F>er</F> window shopping or so. Fortunately, for me, probably unfortunately, she recognized <F>er</F> last week was <F>er</F> <F>oh</F> <?>they are</?> bargain's week or so. Then she recognize <F>oh</F> thirty percent discount or so. <F>Oh</F> then, she <F>eh</F> looked more carefully and she recognize fifty percent discount <F>er</F> shop for lady, not for male.So <R>she just</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> she just in, and got lot of things. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <R>i</R> <SC>i</SC> probably, <R>i</R> <SC>it's <R>ha</R> ha</SC> <SC>he</SC> she was very happy, and <F>er</F> when I got the present, of course, I was very happy. After that, <F>hmm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> That was <R>my</R> my feelings. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yeah.Difference between woman's shop and men's shop?<F>Ohhh</F>. <F>Er</F> frankly speaking, I don't think so. But <F>er</F> for example, <R>m</R> myself, <F>er</F> many people said <F>er</F> woman's shopping is a little bit <??></??> <F>eh</F> <.></.> <F>oh</F> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> <??></??> <F>mm</F> <R>I</R> I forgot. <R>A</R> anyway, so <SC>short no</SC> <SC>short</SC> <F>er</F> <R>no</R> <F>eh</F> no consideration, just <F>er</F> imagination. "<F>Oh</F> it's good", like <?>that</?>. But <F>oh</F> for example, thirty percent discount from higher price, <SC>then</SC> but, just he looks thirty percent discount, "<F>Oh</F> it's very cheap," just <SC>that make</SC> she <SC>make such a</SC> make <F>er</F> imagination and try to buy or so. But <F>er</F> frankly speaking, I was also <SC>same guy</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <OL>same kind of guy</OL>.So if I saw, " <F>Oh</F> thirty percent discount, <F>oh</F> yes, I like to buy <OL>this one or so</OL>.So <F>er</F> frankly, <F>uh</F> I don't think there's so different.Yeah.Yeah.O K. <OL><F>Er</F> <F>er</F></OL>.<SC>This</SC> after this?<F>Oh</F> just I have to <R>go back and wo</R> <F>er</F> go back and work again.But I don't like <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> idea</OL>.<OL><F>Oh</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> please cut this part</OL>.
