?
.
 my name is .
 yes.
 nice to meet you, .
Where do I live? O K. I live in , , in . Yeah.
? . It's one of the local place, even if it's located in , however, it takes about one half hours from here to my home. So it's not so near. 
Yeah.
What time? What time? what time? . Around seven-thirty, I have to leave. .
Train? . Not so bad not so easy. Yeah. 
Yeah.
Yes. I have one son and of course, my wife, only one wife, 
My son? my son is fourteen years old and he's the second grade of junior high school.
 now, he is, how to say it, I don't know the English word, a bit kind of one of class leader or so. Yeah.
Fortunately or unfortunately, 
he is not similar to me. 
Yeah.
 I'm sorry? .
 one of reason is how to say, he is very fair as far as I know. And also, sometimes he is very severe. So one of the comment of his teacher is how to say, sometime you should consider the situation of his friend or so.
 . Yeah, yeah.
 I don't know. I hope so.
Yeah. But at least he has some friend the class or so.
Yeah.
 O K.
Free time.
 you mean, in daytime or so?
Weekend or so? O K. I know. So I like playing pachinko now.
 so and fortunately or unfortunately, how to say, it's very famous or busy pachinko hall near my home,
and do you understand the equal exchange, in Japanese ?
 usually we have to buy sorry, for yen per pachinko ball. One pachinko ball. but when we got ball or so a lot, then, how to say, pachinko hall will buy it from us buy it. For yen, same value.
Yeah. So usually, the no seventy percent to eighty percent of value. They are going to buy it. But this hall or some halls purchasing only hundred percent.
 Yeah. Buy it. So it's good for
when I got a lot of win.
Yeah.
Pachinko? how so two to three hours a day, at only weekend from two o'clock to five o'clock or so, I enjoyed.
Yeah. My wife complains to me. last weekend it was snow.
Yeah. So yeah, in the morning of Sunday,
 I have to clean up the road or so. After that, I said, "What should I do after that?". She said, "Nothing.". ".". 
 I said I go to the pachinko hall.
 yeah.
 she didn't say anything.

.
So yeah.
 I 
Yes.
What do I see?
 O K. they are sitting in a restaurant. Probably it's a French restaurant or so. And at least there are grou one waiter the wine bottle to one guy and he seems he like the wine very much. And next of him, I mean there one lady here sitting and she is looking at . Yeah. . And it's around seven o'clock probably in the evening.
Yeah. One pianist is playing and one other waiter is serving one dish or so.
 yes, fortunately. 
 but it's located in New Otani. I forgot the exact restaurant name.
But expensive , yeah.
 I think three or four years ago.
 it's just that restaurant was very famous of goose meat.
So one of our friend like goose meat or chicken meat, and eat he was introduced this restaurant by someone else.
And he asked me to go. And of course, why not? But he didn't buy my 
. The same as chicken, frankly speaking. 
Yeah.
. Of course, service or atmosphere it's very nice.Yeah. For us, a little bit too nice. 
My pleasure.
.
.
 .
O K.
Yeah.
 yeah. I joined one travel tour to Las Vegas
and of course, you advertised
 very nice.
 luxury very luxury feeling I can enjoy.
Yeah. But unfortunately, we have some problem. Actually, three problems. One is quality of meat or so. So first day, it's not so bad, but second day, I was very surprised. it seemed a kind of vegetable day . So, small meat, probably chicken meat or so I can, but we went to U S A, so I expected to eat or so, other such kind of very expensive meat,
 but unfortunately, I didn't enjoy one day. And so next day, I you know, so I didn't enjoy any beef or so.
 chicken is more expensive than the beef? I don't think , even if in U S A.
And second point is room. Of course, room size itself no problem. But how to say, room keeper or condition it was not so good. For example, I couldn't get hot water. probably within one liter or so when I opened the it starts I forgot the exact when I try to have hot water or so in the bath or so, nothing, so shower, I have to wait five minutes, ten minutes. . But finally, a little bit warm. Of course, Las Vegas itself not so cold
but I like to have hot water, to forty centigrade but I didn't.
Third one? . Third one. Very I expect very, how to say, luxury tour, our our group member should be, how to say, very I suppose it was group or so.
 surprised. so I went to Las Vegas with them, then, its looks like, how say, discount tour, economic tour or so.
 so, I didn't expect such kind of thing.
 Yeah.
.
.
Frankly , not yet. But I expressed such kind of argument to the tour conductor or so. I forgot his name or so, actually. probably ? sorry. excuse me. probably she. 
Yeah.
 mention such kind of thing to local staff or so.
. 
.
 but I don't think they were charged as same cost as myself.
But of course, you can say so, but I was very surprised. so, that kind of ,
only myself and my wife is another kind group or so.
. "What happened?". My wife complained to me, actually, yeah.
. Yeah.
, please. Yeah.
 later?
. when?
O K, so, to my home?
. I'm looking forward to your phone.
.

.
 .
 Yeah.
 you mean, yeah, complain? Yeah. Many times. 
 anyway, so, at first, I try to hear or listen to his comment or so, and also, what happened or so. Then, probably I can guess, " how I can solve the problem or this argument?".
Yeah. and of course, sometimes, it's very difficult because we didn't do any mistake or so. Sometimes based on their mistake or their colleague's mistake, they got mad.
And they complain to us, so in that case, we couldn't help, yeah, or so.
Yeah. .
 .
.
 O K. . One day last week. . Yeah. . Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. so, one day last week, my wife went to the department store to have my birthday present. I like necktie very much, so he picked up green-colored one, and anyway, the she bought it for me. And she paid but usually, I ask her to use credit card. because very dangerous to bring a lot of money or so. but after that, of course, she went to department store. So, just she want to do window shopping or so. Fortunately, for me, probably unfortunately, she recognized last week was bargain's week or so. Then she recognize thirty percent discount or so. then, she looked more carefully and she recognize fifty percent discount shop for lady, not for male.
So she just in, and got lot of things. So probably, ha she was very happy, and when I got the present, of course, I was very happy. After that, . my feelings. 
Yeah.
Difference between woman's shop and men's shop?
. frankly speaking, I don't think so. But for example, myself, many people said woman's shopping is a little bit I forgot. anyway, so no consideration, just imagination. " it's good", like . But for example, thirty percent discount from higher price, but, just he looks thirty percent discount, " it's very cheap," just she make imagination and try to buy or so. But frankly speaking, I was also .
So if I saw, " thirty percent discount, yes, I like to buy .
So frankly, I don't think there's so different.
Yeah.
Yeah.
O K. .
 after this?
 just I have to go back and work again.
But I don't like idea.
 please cut this part. O K.
O K. Yes.
Thank you.
