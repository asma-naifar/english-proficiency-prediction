  I'm fine.

Friday,  I usually  go to school and after school,   I do some activity in my  club.
.
 . My club practices to use English.  . And  there are  three  activities.  first one is the discussion.
And second one is debate. And third one is speech. .  we are  practicing  it.
 I like discussion best.
. .
'Cause   when we are discussing something,   I can use English  much times.   and   in debate or speech time,  I cannot use    English so much.   I like to speak English.
So I like discussion the best.
In discussion?
.  we discussed   about foreigners in Japan.
. There are a lot of problems for foreigners  who live in Japan.
 for example,   they have no right to vote.
. .   and there are a lot of  hard examples. .
,
Weekend?  I usually go out. . Because being at home is boring. .  and I do something. But   I don't have     something special. .
Example.   I go to city like Shinjuku or Ikebukuro.
Yeah. And  go shopping or watch movie. . Sometimes   there is club activity,
 on weekend.
Ikebukuro?   Ikebukuro.  there are a lot of  shops in Ikebukuro. . There are a lot of music shops.  I like music. . And  there are a lot of shops  which sell  used C Ds.
.   so I usually  buy C Ds at  used C D shops.
.
 . There is a girl  sitting a chair. . And  there is a cat on the bed. And there is also a dog on the floor. And        there is a desk    near the window. . And  there is a personal computer on the desk and    also typewriter is on the desk. . And  next to the door, there is the   shelf. And   there is a  C D player  on the shelf. .

One day last week,  two men went to the restaurant.        one was a    young man. And the other one is   the  boss of  that man. . And they two   went in the restaurant and sit together.  And    the young man  ordered  beer and fish food. And the boss ordered a wine    and meat food. . And after they   finished that, the    boss paid   all  money. And then, they said good-bye to each other.
