For example, if there is one city and tour, <F>urm</F> guidebook recommend to go to some <F>urr</F> <.></.> sights, historical sight, very important sights. But, <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> German students would like to show <F>urr</F> <.></.> <SC>industrial</SC> industry or something.<SC>So</SC> but <SC>we are not so in</SC> <F>uh</F> as for me, I'm <??></??> Japanese, Maybe almost all of Japanese <??></??> that kind of <F>urr</F> industry.Sorry?<F>Urrm</F> <.></.> I couldn't do almost <F>urm</F> anything.
