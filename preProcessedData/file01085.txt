 my name is .
Yeah.
Fine. Thanks.
Yeah. 
 this season,  now I have a vacation. I am a student and then I often go to abroad. Yeah. I like to travel.
 sometimes it's East south Asia, but this time,  yesterday I went back Japan. I went to America. So any place, I like to go.
. .  I can think  everything. And I can feel any other kind of experience   which  I never seen or I never  felt.
. San Francisco is .
.
 weather is great because it's not so hot, it's not cold.
And then,    there is a ocean near the city, and   if I stay center of city,  I can go beach and any other famous place and    my favorite point is   there is many kinds of nation. So  I went to New York this time, too, but  I felt   something  different from San Francisco. I think it's  prejudice or something. And then   there are many American in New York, but San Francisco,  there are many nations, Philippino or Chinese or Japanese, so I think there is no prejudice.
, I loved that place.
.
.  I'm major  sports marketing. And before I major that,  I used to study about  muscle and  about human body because my campus is      about human science and  about sports. So   I haven't studied about sports marketing yet, but  from April,  I will start to study.
 because  I love  motor sports and then  there is many advertising, so   I wanna study about   advertisement in sports, so I choosed that.

  there is a woman in her room. And she is sitting front of  her computer. And there is dog and cat. And the  cat is  on her bed. And then dog is sitting down behind her. And    I think she is talking about her computer to their pets.
Yes.
. I often use for Internet and e-mail.
Favorite. .  .  I like Hong Kong movie, so  I often check  the site which is related on the Hong Kong movie   because    if I am in Japan,  it's difficult to collect the information about the Hong Kong movie,  but a web site is for world  and then I can collect  many information,
 Internet.
   I hardly see Japanese movie, so I can't compare, but  I can compare the Hong Kong movie and  Hollywood movie.  I think Hollywood movie is always great and  gorgeous, but  the Hong Kong movie is  the natural, I think. And then,    I think  there are many great actor  in that movie, so I like that point.

O K.
Hello,      I am sorry I couldn't go to your party. .
. Yeah.  .

 yeah. It's   I wanted to call you, but  it was very busy, and  I'd had to go to hospital,    so I couldn't call you.
 .
. ,I wish    I wanted to meet. Yeah.

  rarely, because  I can't drink so much. I am weak, so sometimes I go.
 when I was first grade in university,  the drinking party was really crazy.  almost the   boys drank  and sometimes they couldn't  stand and they couldn't walk. So we have to take care of them.  but   recently we  don't held that kind of party and then besides  I don't go to that kind of party because I'm weak and  I can't drink so much   so sometimes I go with my   best friend or two or three people. And then I enjoy a little bit alcohol.
?
 eating.  .   I am always eating, and          I want  my friend to drink, so  I don't drink, but  I talk and then    I have them to drink. .
 . Last week. 
.     can I make up ?
.
  . The last week,  the two men  went to the restaurant, and the  older man  invite the younger man  to  have dinner. And then  the younger man  ordered what he wanted to eat and the  older man    was pleased and  they were drinking and eating a great dinner and   the younger man ate  fish and  older man ate the chicken. And      after they ate the dinner,  the older man   paid and the younger man was very satisfied because he was full and then,        they finished their dinner and they went back home each other.
. No.
Yeah. Maybe  I will meet my friend.
 I didn't  I haven't meet my best friend   while   while I went to U. S. So      I wanna talk about the travel.
