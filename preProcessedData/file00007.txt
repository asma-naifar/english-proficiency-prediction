 my name is .
 meet you .
. 
   .    you mean,  my home?
   I come from .
Yes.
 .   I walked to the station as just a few minutes walk  from my home. And I got a  line, and I change the train at the  Station   from  line to  line, and I got a  line and I got off at a  Station and I took the bus. 
Yeah.
    it's a kind of suburb.
Yes. So there's a many condominiums. And,   at first,   it planned. So, the first, the roads  were built.
So it's very  neat.   I don't know how to say, but it's a neat.
. I have lived  there for  more than fifteen years.
Yes.
  I have  two boys and a husband. 
So all my family members are four.
 my elder son is a  college student, and my younger one is a    student of a cram school.
I hope so. 
 . I'm interested in  green plants, and  I like a herb. So I'm learning about herbs.
No. . I live in a condominium, so I don't have any garden. But I have many pots in my balcony.
  yeah.  But, now, it's a winter season. So a little bit   to sorry for the  green plants  it's too cold for them.
.       I think it's   to keep the green plants  vividly. Sometimes, I forgot  to water them, so, sometimes,   they died. 
.
.
Yeah,  yes. .  The girl in this room  seems to like a computer,   and,  yeah,  I think     she is neat, and her room is a very clean.   and  even though she has two pets a dog and cat, but the room is still clean. 
 . And,       yes,    what should I describe? 
.
.  If someone who has pets   keep their room clean,  I think it's O K.  otherwise   if  he or she     doesn't have enough maintainance,    it would be very unclean.
So,  depends on  a  personality.
.
Hello.  ?
,  I would like    to watch a movie  "The Sixth Sense".  would you like to go with me?
O K. Let's go together.
.   when would you like to go?
So, O K. Let's go this Saturday.
Where  shall we meet?

. . O K.     let's meet  just in front of the Big Box near 
 at noon.
. Shall we have a lunch together?
. Do you know   where is the theater?
.
O K. . Shall we go to Ginza?
O K. So,   O K, let's take the  Tozai line and  go to Ginza and have lunch  in Ginza.
O K. So, see you   on Saturday noon. 
O K. See you.
 sometimes.
.
.  my friends are usually middle aged, so,  sometimes, we took   like a town-watching.
. Last week, my friends I went to a Asakusabashi, and we went to some Japanese paper shop. It's a very traditional shop. They have a long history, and we went to a some wholesaler. And we droped so many  shops. It was fun.
. Yes. I bought  a several  pieces of Japanese paper for New Year's decoration.
Yeah.
. I use it     for the sheet  for the . I bought a red and white paper.
? Yeah,  I hope so.
. One day,  a women went  for shopping  to the department store.   she wanted to buy   a present   for her husband. And     she chose the necktie for her husband. And   she select a  yellow dot on a green  tie. And she asked the salesclerk  to wrap it as a gift.   and,   after finishing  to buy a present, she wanted to buy something for herself.   she asked the salesclerk, "Where is the women's department?". And he said, "It's the third floor.". So  she went there       by stairways.
. Not yet.
.  Yes,  I will.
 .  If I  buy something  which he doesn't like it,  it's a kind of a trash.
. It would be a kind of trash. So   it's a kind of waste. So   he likes some wine or something. It's consumable, so I'm going to buy  some wine or champagne.   we can consume. 
  anyway,   if I select  wine,   he would drink.
 so it will disappear. So it's O K.
, if he doesn't like it,   we have to keep it. So  I live in a condominium, so we don't have enough space to keep   something we  don't want. So I'd like  some to consumable.
.
Yes.
Yes I do.
   .  when  I arrived at home, it would be  around six o'clock. So it's little bit late. So I'm going to cook a simple one.
Thank you.
