Yeah.It's pretty good. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> I like how there is a lot of returnee students that I can relate with. <R>So</R> so people that have come from abroad with like the same background as I so it's pretty easy to relate with them.<OL><??></??></OL> now.Yeah.<F>Oh</F> I've been in the United States and Canada.Yeah.<F>Oh</F> <F>well</F> <SC>in Canada</SC> <F>urm</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> I don't know, <SC>it's</SC> in Japan, I feel like I'm always busy like I'm constantly busy because <F>well</F> I'm also <R>in the</R> in the cheerleading club. And that takes up a lot of my time.And also <F>well</F> it takes a lot of time just <R>f</R> from the transportationbecause I live kind of far from the school so I feel like I have no time. <nvs>laughter</nvs><nvs>cough</nvs><F>Well</F> I've always been interested in dancing and <F>urm</F> even when I lived in Canada and in the United States, I was in dance. And that's why <F>well</F> <SC>from</SC> like from when I was little I've always wanted to see how it felt to be like <SC>a cheerleading</SC> <F>ur</F> a cheerleader. So that's why I joined this club.<F>Well</F> in this school, we don't really cheer for any sports teams.<?>Because it's</?> basically, kind of weird, but we cheer for ourselves <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>because we go to competitions and stuff. And we don't really cheer for the sports team. <CO>So</CO>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <nvs>cough</nvs><F>Oh</F> <F>urm</F> I have an older brother. He is nineteen. And I have a younger sister who's in the sixth grade right now. <OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL><F>Oh</F> <SC>my</SC> he goes to a university here in Japan. And <F>well</F> I'm really close to him so sometimes he takes me to movies and stuff like that.<nvs>cough</nvs>Yeah.Yeah.O K.O K. <F>Urm</F> it looks like a pretty nice neighborhood because <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>well</F> in front of the car, there's <SC>two lady in this</SC> or two ladies <R>con</R> conversing probably about the neighborhood or something, maybe, they saw.<F>Urm</F> and there's also <F>well</F> children playing <F>urm</F> which means that there's probably like a lot of families living in that neighborhood. <nvs>cough</nvs> <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <F>well</F> to me, it looks like a pretty normal neighborhood. <OL><R>And</R></OL><F>well</F>and then like how there's a lot of trees.So <OL>yeah</OL>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><F>Uh</F></OL> yeah. <F>Mm</F> <OL><?>mine as well</?></OL><OL><CO>In my</CO></OL>.<F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> my most memorable experience was probably when I was like in the first grade. And <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>well</F> ever since I was little I used to play with my brother. And this one time or actually a couple of times in the summer, <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>urm</F> my friends and I and also my brother's friends, <SC>we all</SC> <F>urm</F> we used to play in the street in front of our house. <F>Urm</F> we'd set up two goal posts and we played <??></??> hockey <R>in</R> in front of our houses. So that was pretty fun and <SC>that</SC> we always used to do that in the summer.<nvs>cough</nvs><OL><F>Ur</F></OL> no. I live in an apartment house so I don't really have the street in front of my house. <nvs>laughter</nvs>In my free time, <F>well</F> lately I don't have that much free time since <SC>I always</SC> <F>well</F> I have practice until late and when I get home, I usually just eat dinner and do my <laughter>homework</laughter> and go to sleep.But when I do have time, like on the train, I like to read books.<OL>Yeah</OL>. <OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL><F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> lately I was reading "Harry Potter," but now <SC>I s</SC> <F>urm</F> I've switched to a book called "A Child Called It".And there's three series <?>the</?> book. I finished reading the book and I'm on the last book which is called "A Man Called Dave".Yeah.<F>Oh</F> <F>urm</F> "A Child Called It," it's about a little boy who gets abused by his mother. It's about child abuse and domestic abuse <R>and</R> and <nvs>cough</nvs> it's really, <F>uhh</F> I don't know, like terrifying because like I just can't believe that a mother would treat like her own child that badly. And like to the verge where <SC>he</SC> she almost killed him. <nvs>smack</nvs> <OL><SC>And</SC></OL><nvs>cough</nvs> but <F>well</F> <??></??> <F>well</F> that author really inspired me because even though that was happening and <SC>he tric</SC> <F>ur</F> he was like about to give up, he didn't give up on <?>himself</?>. And <nvs>sniff</nvs> now I think because of that experience, he's a lot stronger than he used to be. <OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL>Yeah.O K.<OL>O K</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.<OL><F>Oh</F> O K</OL>. <CO><F>Oh</F> shall I read out loud or</CO>?<OL>O K</OL>.O K.<F>Urm</F> hi. <nvs>laughter</nvs><.></.> I would like to buy C D. <F>Urm</F>.<.></.>Sorry, I don't really get this. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uh-huh</F>.All right.O K. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>I'm sorry</laughter>.<nvs>cough</nvs>Hi, yes. <F>Urm</F> <SC>I would like to purchase this C D <F>ur</F> but</SC> or I purchased it but I realize that this isn't the C D that I wanted. <F>Urm</F>it's a different album.<nvs>sniff</nvs> <SC>Can I have a</SC> can I exchange it for another one?<F>Urm</F> then can I return it and probably <F>ur</F> get a refund or something?<nvs>cough</nvs><F>Oh</F> O K. Then thank you very much. I'll be careful next time. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uh-huh</F>.O K. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F>.<F>Well</F> <SC>I was looking for</SC> <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>urm</F> I borrowed a C D from my friend but then I accidentally misplaced it. And now <F>well</F> I came here to buy <F>urm</F> a replacement for my friend, but <SC>I</SC> when I got home I realized that this wasn't the album that I needed. So <F>urm</F> <SC>it's really urgent to me that</SC> <F>ur</F> it's really important that <R>I get this</R> <F>uh</F> I get this C D exchanged for the other one.O K.<OL><laughter>O K</laughter></OL>.<OL><laughter>Thank you very much</laughter></OL>.O K. Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.<F>Urm</F>.<nvs>cough</nvs> <F>Er</F> <F>um</F>. Yeah. I have, but then <F>well</F> if that's the store policy, then I thought like you can't really fight it because if, let's say, the person <?>that's</?> <F>urm</F> exchanged it for me, if they weren't allowed, then <R>if</R> if they get in trouble, then it's probably my fault, <OL>too</OL>.And I don't like putting people in problems because of my fault. Soyeah.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <nvs>sniff</nvs> I know in Japan, <F>ur</F> I guess it's so much like more <F>urm</F> accessible because if I just hop on the train, I can go to Shibuya, I can go to Ikebukuro, I can go anywhere.But <SC>when I was on</SC> when I was in the States, <F>well</F> I had to get my mom to drive me there or my friend's mom. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And <F>well</F> I couldn't really easily go to the mall or anything. So<nvs>cough</nvs> I think it's easier to shop in Japan if you have money. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>O K.<F>Mm-hm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.O K.O K.<nvs>sniff</nvs> <nvs>cough</nvs>O K.One day last week, <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>urm</F> a man <nvs>sniff</nvs> was driving his car, and at the same time, there's another man who's driving <R>a</R> <F>ur</F> a moped. <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Urm</F> this man on the moped was talking to his girlfriend and wasn't really watching the road or being careful. <nvs>sniff</nvs>And <nvs>cough</nvs> <SC>when he di</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>when he's</SC> while he was driving, <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>urm</F> the man in the yellow car or the orange car <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> hit or kind of crushed into the man in the scooter <nvs>sniff</nvs> <SC>causing the cell phone that he was usi</SC> <F>ur</F> causing the man on the scooter <R>t</R> to drop his cell phone. <nvs>cough</nvs> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Urm</F> after that incident, both men got off the vehicles and started arguing about who had the fault. <nvs>sniff</nvs> The man on the scooter <nvs>cough</nvs> <F>urm</F> insisted that the man in the yellow car had the fault because he wasn't paying attention <F>urm</F> when he was driving even though the man on the scooter had <F>ur</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> just the same amount of fault because he wasn't paying attention to the road either because he was talking on the cell phone. <nvs>cough</nvs> And so after a while, a police officer arrived, and they both explained the <nvs>cough</nvs> incident. <nvs>sniff</nvs> And both men told their stories. <nvs>cough</nvs> But <F>urm</F> after hearing both men's side of the story, the policeman <SC>decided or</SC> yeah, decided that the man on the scooter had the fault. And <R>that</R> <nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>ur</F> that he had to <F>urm</F> get his scooter towed away and probably <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>get another</SC> <F>ur</F> take another exam for his license because obviously <SC>he did</SC> he wasn't <F>urm</F> worthy of having that license.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F> not really.<OL>Only</OL> E-mailing sometimes.Yeah.<F>Well</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> for me, <F>well</F> when I lived in the United States, I'd talk on the phone a lot with my friends. But in Japan, <nvs>sniff</nvs> <SC>I</SC> like the phone bill is really expensive and so I guess <F>urm</F> to take the place of like making phone calls, they <F>urm</F> send each other E-mails to talk like the times <F>er</F> they aren't there at school.<nvs>cough</nvs>O K.<F>Well</F> I have to go back to class, <SC>but then</SC> and then after that, I have cheerleading practice. <OL>So</OL><OL>I have to get back</OL>.Yeah.<F>Urm</F> usually practice is from four to six.But<OL>sometimes</OL> we practice even more than that. So I'm not sure what time I'm gonna get home yet.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.<OL>Thank you</OL>.
