And he <R>c</R> <F>um</F> cares about us a lot. And he likes to play with our cat.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.Yes.<F>Um</F> I go shopping or I go <F>um</F> just ride my <SC>bike</SC> bicycle around my house. And sometimes I jog.Yeah.My hobby? Yes. I like to read books. <F>Um</F> books about Japan and <F>um</F> the relation between Japan and other countries. I used to read Sherlock Holmes a <laughter>lot</laughter>.Yeah.<F>Um</F> because, you know, the stories are full of adventure.And at the end of the book, you get to know what really happened.And you get to know how he, you know, found out who caused the incident or murder or whatever.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mh-hmm</F>.Yes.<F>Um</F> you know, many foreign people who come to Japan say things like Japanese don't have the ability to communicate with other people, like they're not so friendly, and they sometimes criticize it in a not a nice way.<OL>And</OL> <R>I</R> I thought that maybe it's just their culture. I mean, Japan used to be a country like <F>um</F> <SC>not <R>so</R> <SC>social</SC> so</SC> it didn't really socialize with the other <OL>countries</OL>.So maybe people aren't just used to it <R>and</R> <F>um</F> and the foreigners who come to Japan <SC>are</SC> of course, <SC>they <?>into the</?> <SC?>u</SC?> <?>not</?> <?>you l</?> <?>u</?></SC> they like to socialize a lot. So I think that <SC>it's just kind of a</SC> what do you say, it's just their opinionsof seeing <R>how</R> how Japanese are. And <R>I thin</R> I think that's kind of a prejudice.Yeah.Yeah.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.Thank you.<F>Um</F>.It's a picture of classroom. And there's a teacher in front of the classroom and she is teaching mathematics. And <SC>there are <F>er</F> students</SC> there are six students. And some of them are studying and they're listening to what the teacher is saying. But <F>er</F> more than half of them are doing their own stuff. They are talking or they're chewing their bubble gums or they're drinking or they're listening to music and they aren't paying attention.O K.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.This school? <F>Um</F> when I started out when I was in <F>er</F> first year, the classroom <SC>was</SC> wasn't like this. There was more <F>um</F> filled with students who would listen to the teacher. But as we got closer to the graduation, <F>um</F> maybe our classroom is becoming to turn like this. Yeah. There are students who don't really pay attention because they don't really care.<nvs>laughter</nvs>Yeah.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>. Yes.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.O K.Yes.Yeah. <F>Um</F>. <??></??> <OL>Sorry</OL>.<F>Oh</F> <F>uh</F> sorry.<OL><F>Um</F></OL> <SC>I was</SC> I booked for a ticket for this train but I couldn't come in time.

So can't you call the people from the bus?<F>Ah</F> yes, I have my ticket.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.So can I wait until he comes back?<F>Oh</F>. Can't you get someone else, <OL>you think</OL>?Yes. Could you do that, please?Thank you very much.<OL><?>O K</?></OL>.Yes.Thank you very much.Bye.<F>Uh</F>.<F>Mm</F> no.I try not to be late for things.<F>Uh-huh</F>.I would explain to the teacher that or I would call the teacher before the exam <SC>starts</SC> begins and then I would tell him that the train is late so I can't make it on time.Maybe they would, like fix another date for the exam.And then I could take it privately <?>again</?>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.One day last week, <F>er</F> Mister Jacobs was walking towards <SC>the train</SC> I mean the station. And then <SC>he</SC> <F>er</F> when he reached the platform, he accidentally dropped his suitcase. <SC>And</SC> <F>oh</F> but it wasn't an accident. It was actually <F>er</F> a person beside him <F>er</F> <laughter><?>tucked</?> him</laughter> by his elbow and he dropped it. So he explained to the person beside him that it was his fault that he dropped his suitcase. But while they were arguing, the train had arrived and the train nearly <F>er</F> <SC?>wen</SC?> passed through the suitcase. <SC>So he</SC> so Mister Jacobs was really <F>er</F> upset because he thought that his suitcase was <F>er</F> ruined. But after the train passed, he found that the suitcase was O K and he was relieved. And later on, <R>the</R> <F>er</F> <SC>the station</SC> a man who works for the station <F>er</F> <.></.> got the suitcase for him. And he pass it to <OL>him</OL>.<F>Mm</F>. <F>Oh</F> sometimes I see those people on the train and <SC>I</SC> at first when I saw it for the first time, I thought it was kind of embarrassing as <F>um</F> a woman,cause, you know, makeup is something that you do to <F>er</F> not show <laughter>your real face</laughter> or something, to cover <laughter>up your real face</laughter>. <laughter><CO>So</CO></laughter>.<F>Um</F>. But as I got used to it, <R>I</R> <R>I</R> I started to feel nothing and <SC>I thi</SC> <R>I</R> I thought that maybe they didn't have time to do it in their homes or something.<F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I don't <?>improve with</?> that, because <SC>it can</SC> you know, <F>um</F> it would disturb other passengers on the train and maybe people get annoyed just to hear other people talk. So I don't think that's a good thing.<F>Um</F> <R>I</R> I was very young <SC>when I was in</SC> <F>er</F> when I lived in a foreign country.<F>Um</F> Ireland.<OL>Yes</OL>.<OL><F>Oh</F> yes, of course</OL>, I remember.<F>Um</F> I was really little and I only remember myself playing with my friends and, <F>um</F> you know, having a good time. So <R>I</R> I don't really have an exciting memory.I was four years old when I went there. And I lived there for five years.Yeah.It was mainly school and home.<F>Um</F> it was a catholic school. And <R>the</R> the teachers were all nuns. And <F>um</F> every morning, we went to the chapel to pray. And <F>um</F> <SC>people</SC> the people there <R>we</R> were really nice. <R>They</R> they were very kind to me. They took care of me well.And my friends were very nice. There were only about thirteen students in one grade.So, yeah,it was a good place.<F>Oh</F> no. It was all Irish. This was an Irish school.Yeah.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.
