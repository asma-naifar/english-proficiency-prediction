 I like movie, but  I usually watch the movie   after movies are produced by   rental video.
 because  the rental video is  cheaper than watching movie.
  I like nonfiction one.  for example,     I have no idea now. But I like nonfiction one.
  so   I think that the fiction movie is made by someone. And the   someone think he want to    express his mind. But nonfiction movie  is made by only fact.  I like the reality.
One day last week.
   I make a story?
  one day last week, she found that she have no food. So  she go to a supermarket by her car.  and she bought  something to eat.      she pay money at register. And   she bring many foods  to her home by car. And      she cooked with these things.

 I think I want to do cooking, but       I usually don't cook.

  I think  she is not good at cooking. 
 because    she often use   food or instant food.  actually  she make  a normal cooking, but    I think she is not good at cooking.
