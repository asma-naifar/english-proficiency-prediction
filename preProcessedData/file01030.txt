Which place?

  place.   my memorable place is  .
   I lived there  from  nineteen ninety-seven
to nineteen ninety-eight.
   I went there   because of my husband's  study.
.   there  I live in guesthouse of  University.
     many foreigners live there.   my neighbors were  American, Indian, or  Russian,
 and Chinese. And      with   various kinds of nationality.  .

the most     impressive thing  was        that was first day  when I   started to live
 in a guesthouse.
 I saw a Japanese in a house. And   I said to him "". But no reply.
  I was puzzled.  and  few days later    other    my neighbor  American
said to me  he was from Uzbekistan.
         the boy lived    with his  sister and  his mother.
 the mother was a scholar.  the mother was  German language expert.
. . So  the  Uzbekistan people are  very similar to Japanese.

   I'm going to buy a present   for my friend
from high school       who gave  birth to her first baby
 last year.
    
 but    I had known  that  she was pregnant
   with the New Year Card
last year.
  but I didn't know   
   when she would  give birth.
So    with the New Year Card  this year
     two months ago
     I've known
that she  gave birth to her first baby
  last May or June.
Thank you.
