 from the morning   until now. Yeah,     I'm fine now.
 O K, yes.
Yeah,     last night, yes.  I went to bed at two o'clock because  I started reading comics  from  midnight, and I'd like to  finish  reading that book    by one o'clock,  but after ,  I finished  reading that book round    one thirty, yeah. After that,  I took a bath, and I went to the bed, yes.
 comic. Yeah, I love comic, and  that comic  which I read last night  is showing around the  situation of  Japanese . Yeah,    I could know  how to  produce Japanese , yeah,  that was very   interesting.
Yes,  I live in the company dormitory  located in .   is  located  in the   prefecture, and it takes about  twenty minutes  from   by  line, and my office is located in , so it takes about  thirty minutes  from my  to the house.  it is very convenient .
.
  my room?
.   my room is in the dormitory,  so  there are  no toilet and bathroom in my room, but  in my room,  there are  some furnitures  like a desk and chair and bed, and so on. And    I have many books   in my room about  
 hundred books.

compared to  my class,  and  I think that    these students are junior high school students.    yeah, when I was a junior high school student,   I  listened to  my teacher  more carefully, .
.
Yeah,   I think  she has to  get angry  with them  more , and  yeah, of course,   she has to     try to speak  more interesting story about mathematics, not only  using textbook, I think.
