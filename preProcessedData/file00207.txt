He makes a diamond cutter.Yes. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Uh-hum</F>.<F>Oh</F> you know, e-mail, it's convenient.<R>Beca</R> because I usually use computer in the office. And <F>urr</F> I have to check the e-mail at <F>err</F> every time everywhere so, my father <F>urr</F> also <SC>has</SC> use the computer in the office. So, <SC>I have</SC> <SC>I</SC> it is better to use the computer.Yes.Yes.

I can see the four trees in garden. And <F>oh</F> car is parked in front of the house. One of the house is my host family house. <F>Urr</F> I can see my host father. He is <F>urr</F> <R>running</R>, running now. <R>He</R> he runs every morning around here and he will join <R>the</R> the marathon race <R>next</R>, which is hold the next month. And I can see the my host mother. <F>Urr</F> she is talking with her <F>urr</F> friend <F>urr</F> about the movie. <F>Urr</F> she went to the movie theatre on <F>ur</F> last weekend and she watched the Keanu Reaves movie.

I think.<F>Urr</F> <F>umm</F> usually, <SC>the United</SC> the house in United States has four <R>ba</R> <SC>bath</SC> <SC>bedrooms</SC> four bathrooms and big living. <F>Urr</F> in my house, <SC>I just</SC> <R>I have</R> I have one living room and one bedroom. That's all. And <R>the other</R> the other difference is as for the cost. Probably it cost about <F>umm</F> <F>um</F> <F>umm</F> <R>four million dollar</R> four million dollar to get the my house.Yes. <CO>But</CO>.<OL>Sorry</OL>?<F>Uh-hum</F>.<F>Urr</F> <F>em</F> so <F>erm</F> <SC>I think</SC> <F>umm</F> sorry <F>urr</F> I think <F>urr</F> one difference. <SC>It's a</SC> <F>urr</F> my host father has a children. But my neighbor doesn't have the any children. So it's a big difference. And also, <F>ur</F> house style is little difference. <F>Urr</F> my <SC>fa</SC> host father's house has one floor, but <SC>my neigh</SC> my host family's neighbor has the two floor, you know.
