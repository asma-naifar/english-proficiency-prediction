Good afternoon.
Yes. I'm .
Yes.
I'm fine, . How are you?
No. I didn't have 
today.
I live in and , which is a small town. And it about two hours long from here.
Yes. .
 sometimes I read books, and sometimes I do nothing and just sleep.
Yeah.
Yes. I . But, my parents don't that they don't like my moving to living alone.
.
I think it's just living alone cost a lot, and I think that is the biggest thing they don't agree with that, I think.
 I have part-time job, so on Tuesday and Wednesday evening, I work at the cram school, I like to go shopping, so I often go shopping with my friends or my parents.
.
Why?
Because I need money. 
and I get some money from my parents monthly, but it's not enough to me, and I need to get more money
 I want to experience the social things. So I think working and having part-time job is good to experience many things. So I work at cram school.
 at the cram school, I teach English and Japanese and Math to the junior high school students, so I think I'm learning the how to communicate with the children and other teachers. I think it's a good experience to me.
Yeah.
Yes.
 I like , because there are many kinds of people in , and especially, the my literature campus, and many there are many people , variety ages. 
 so, sometimes I become friend with the person who are much older than me. And that's really interesting to be the kind of person.
Yes.
. an audio shop and maybe one man is asking to buy something, and a man working at the shop is, maybe, explain something to that man. And there are many audios in the store, and some telephone and some stereos, and two TV and video cameras, and and watches. and, now is the three o'clock maybe at evening. and I don't know what this young man is going to buy. . . .
 .
Yes. I would like to buy that .
 firstly, I will look at that the price, and maybe, forty thousand yen is good for the stereo, I think. So, under forty thousand yen,
 and the stereo need to have two cassettes recorder, and one C D recorder, and one M D recorder. . Yes. 
Yes.
 I think I will go to the discount shop, because it's much cheaper than any other shops. so, maybe I will look around the discount shops. Yes.
Yes.
