Yes, I like.
      I saw "The  Titanic"  last year.
And "Titanic"    is the very famous  and long movie. But    it was       very good  for me.
 I saw  the movie  with  my wife.
Both   is    satisfied.
So   I like     some  brass band or   little orchestra   played the   music  on the boat.    the band  was playing     until   the boat    was broken.
