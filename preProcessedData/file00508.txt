And  I went to the supermarket by car because the food is going to be   a lot.  O K, and, after I went to the supermarket, I was thinking  what going to make for dinner. And I decided to make  spaghetti and salad. So I bought some foods like  pasta and tomato and onion and lettuce  and  some food,
for them. And I bought them. And I went back to home, and I started to prepare for a dinner. And they told me to visit at six o'clock,  so they came to  six o'clock. But  I haven't finished  cooking yet. So I told them to wait for thirty minutes, and I cooked
And after thirty minutes, I prepared, and all set, and I serve them. And I, my parents  and my cousins had dinner together, and we had a very good time together .
