 . This is a, maybe,   mathematics class in high school. .  .  A teacher   describe    some  mathematics problem using blackboard.  But   some student are not so concentrated  on her explanation.  . Some  watching outside. Some girls are  chatting each other. And some guy drinking  water with      personal   or something like that.  .  .  .
O K?
.  . Relationship is not so tight    in my view. So      she needs some  more  effort to create the relationship between  she and   her student in class.
.  . One point is,      at first,  she should know    the average level of  her students.   how much  they understand the  current    and what is the    difficult point to understand. .  that is one point, I guess.
.
.
.
All right.
 .   .  I bought a  new pen  in your shop, but,  unfortunately, I found some trouble on it. So     I'd like to propose you  to change this one  to another new one  that works well.
.  . Writing is  not so good.  ink is sometimes  disappear, the  line is dotted like this here.
  . When I  tried it  in your shop,  that's O K. But I found it when I  came back home and tried to write   some letters. .  at that time, I found some trouble  on this, your pen.
.     but     I bought this yesterday, and I have a   receipt here. So, why  you cannot accept      so far?
O K.
O K. Here.
I see, I see. .  .  I guess I missed the  explanation. .   I didn't recognize it. So that's why  you can't accept my request. .  . O K.
.  it's another way to claim. Yeah.  it's possible.
O K. I try it.
 . Maybe, sometimes. But   never in English. 
 ?  what do you mean?
. O K.  .    .   I have met the similar case in    shopping ball pen or something like similar      stationary product, I bought. That's why      I used this .
.   so,  at that time,   I think it was the same day.  So the   change of product was accepted. I  .
Yeah.
.  O K.
 Excuse me.
 in this case,  which person   is I
Either one? O K, O K.  Anyway, O K. One day last week,   I drove my car  in a fine day, and  I felt  very comfortable on driving.     and   some guys    were  riding a motorbike  using cellphone. Then,     at the corner,   I try to   turn left at the point  watching  carefully.  But      the guy on motorbike     did not recognize     I was going to   turn left    at that point. So, finally,  his motorcycle  are bumped in front of my car.   and his  motorbike was damaged    at the back of his  motorcycle. And  his cellphone was      destroyed. Then,     we called a policeman to  describe our situation. And I claimed that      he used the cellphone on riding motorcycle,   he shou so     he lack  enough attention around his situation. So that's why     this accident occurred. That was  my explanation to  a policeman. And    his motorcycle was  so damaged that   he couldn't  use it at that time.           he and he needed some repairment on his motorcycle. Then,     he requested   transportation his  motorcycle by   car shop dealer or  repairment  manufacturer.
That's all for my story.
.
O K.  .  Do you mean after the explanation?
.   I have to  check the  damage of my car, and we can  check  I can  drive it or not.      and I should  exchange our information to    contact him .
 .  and,   what should I do?
?
. This weekend? .  Not decided yet. But      I hope some   physical activity  with my  family and especially with my daughter.  .  . Welcomed in this  Saturday and Sunday.
