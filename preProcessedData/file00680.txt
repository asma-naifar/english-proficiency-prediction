  so I order the most expensive food. 
So           when we have a lunch,      we talked about various topic.  But     my father  were concentrated to eat.   so he don't  listen to me seriously.
 After we have lunch,     I'm     full   but  my father  wallet is empty.           then  I say him good bye.   we go home. 
Sorry.
