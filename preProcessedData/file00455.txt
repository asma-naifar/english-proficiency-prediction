 I had to write two English report. and one report is have to write in computer and send by e-mail. So that's 
What do you study? now I'm belong to literature class. And I selected mainly art and drama or movie class.
 computer.
 why I study computer? my home has one note . but I use it only Internet to see homepage. but I think that is more useful machine. But I can't use all of that. I don't know use that perfectly. so I wanted to know more about computer.
 now I belong to two clubs. one is announcement club. another is music club. Yeah.
Announcer? in my high school days, I belong to drama club. So I think I like read something by my voice. And so I want to belong to something about voice. but drama club is I heard very strict. And some club can't attend to school class, have to absent class. So I want to study, so I belong to announcement club. .
 maybe. and so I heard to become an announcer is very difficult. so I think so, too. . .
 announcer. good point. so some people want to feel look at me . but some people can meet to important people who can't see in normal life. only T V. Yes.
.
 . Can I start?
Yes. in restaurant. maybe this restaurant is very gorgeous restaurant. And some couple is in here to eat dinner. one of couple is young men and women and who were very gorgeous dressed. And a man orders some wine looks very expensive. And sommelier introduce about wine. and a man is very pleased with this wine. And the girlfriend is girls looks happily about this. And so this couple is, I think, now waiting main dishes. so this restaurant looks very gorgeous because near the wall, one lady pianist is playing the piano. And so that is very wide space is set for a little people. and so, this couple is maybe some event. for example, marriage or birthday party because this restaurant looks very gorgeous. So normally, we can't rest so I think this boyfriend is make an effort to go here. .

 sometimes, but not .
 so the restaurants where I go to often is there is not sommelier. And maybe drink bar and we are served some empty glass. And I have to go to drink bar to get drink. and no pianist. so that is very . Very reasonable, .

One day last week. . a couple is walking the road in rainy days. and boyfriends hear some animal's voice that hears like cat. And in the box, the girlfriend cat found a cat. And she asked the boyfriend " I want to have it and I get it with me.". but the boyfriend I think, don't like cat. maybe cats . and he is very confused. but girlfriend is asked the boyfriend " please allow to have this cat. so this cat is very cute and maybe you became like cat.". And so the boy friend is kind for the girlfriends. so he allow her to have this cat. and they go home with the cat. .
 now I have two cats. two very white cats.
 the cat is brother. And one of cats is a boy and another is girl. And they have very white hair. and boy cat is have very blue eye. but girl cat have, one of her eye is blue and another is green. so when I saw it, why she have two colors eyes. I feel strange. but now, I think it is very cute. so now she is three point five kilogram. but boy cat is about five kilogram. I think it is too heavy and too big cat. so I think I want to him become more slim cat. but he is very like to eat. And he is often eat his sister's meal. And the girl girl cat is, I think, very kind cat. And so when he wants to eat her meal, she leaves all the meal.
 thank you.
