 about this year, I spend a lot of time
in studying.
 . often we have lunch together, so the lunch time is the time for communicating with my friends.
 for example, today, my friend was excited because she could got a mail from the boy she likes. So she was so excited.
So happy.

 I didn't have a experience of a travel so much. but I like.
. I prefer train.
. Because easy to trains are more comfortable because we don't have so much trouble to get on the train. But, for airplane, we have to have a lot of check. we have to be examined. but, recently the train is very dangerous because of the train window often cracks.
So, if I went to the travel, now, I prefer airplane.
 if I could afford, I prefer.
One day last week,
 I opened up the refrigerator in my house. But there was nothing to eat. So I was so confused. but it can't be helped. I had to go supermarket near my house. And I'd like to the supermarket, and I chose some foods I needed at that time.
 in the supermarket, there was a lot of foods, and I picked up and the food I bought was so heavy, I had to place the food I bought on the back of the car. it was too much to place in the car. So I present on back seat. And, when I got home, I began to cooking. At first, I wanted to sunny-side-up. So I cooked it. I was eager to have nice meals.
 what kind of shopping? Everything?
. yes, I like. .
 shopping in book store for a long time. so, if I bought a lot of books, it wouldn't cost so much. So I don't need to feel depressed because I hadn't spend so much money. "What could I do?". I don't have to be depressed like that. So buying book is very fun. And it is also fun to choose my clothes. But clothes are often very expensive. So of course, it's fun. But, sometimes I found myself very depressed because I spent a lot of money just for clothes. And I can't use cloth for a long time compared with books. So, sometimes buying clothes can depress me.
. in most case, I have a plan. But, sometimes I want buy clothes, suddenly.
. Yes.
 this Christmas?
. on the twenty-forth, the Christmas Eve, I don't have plan. 
 no. But maybe, on the Christmas day, I will have a date. But, twenty-forth, I don't have any plan. So I might do my part-time job.
 almost finished. on Wednesday, in the school of literature, all the classes could end.
. . But part-time job is not so problem.
. No, not at all. 
 very much.
