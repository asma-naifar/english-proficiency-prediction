Because <F>erm</F> <SC>train is <SC>more easy to</SC> <F>er</F> easy to</SC> <F>er</F> trains are more comfortable <F>erm</F> because <SC>we didn't have so much</SC> <F>er</F> <F>mm</F> we don't have <F>mm</F> so much trouble <R>to</R> to <SC>get in</SC> get on the train.

But <SC>there's</SC> there was <F>erm</F> nothing to eat. So <SC>I was confu</SC> I was so confused. <F>Erm</F> but it can't be helped. <R>I had to</R> I had to go supermarket near my house. And I'd like to the supermarket, <SC>and choo</SC> and I chose some foods <R>I needed</R> I needed at that time.<R>The supermarket</R> <SC>the supermarket</SC> in the supermarket, there was a lot of foods, and I picked up <F>erm</F> <SC>some bread, some meats <R>and</R> <F>mm</F> and</SC> some bread, some meat and other stuffs. And I paid for the money. And, because <R>the</R> the food I bought was so heavy, <F>er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I have to</SC> <R>I had</R> I had to <F>erm</F> place the food I bought <F>erm</F> on the back of the car. <F>Erm</F> it was <R>too much</R> too much to <F>er</F> place <R>in the</R> in the car. So <SC>I pret</SC> I present on back seat. And, <SC>when I get home</SC> when I got home, <F>erm</F> I began to cooking. At first, I wanted to <F>erm</F> sunny-side-up. So I <F>mm</F> cooked it. <F>Erm</F> <SC>I was very eager to</SC> <SC>I would</SC> <F>erm</F> I was eager to <F>er</F> <SC>ha nice</SC> have nice meals.<F>Mm</F> <F>erm</F> what kind of shopping? Everything?<F>Erm</F>. <SC>I like</SC> <F>mm</F> yes, I like. <F>Mm</F>.<F>Mm</F> <SC>I like <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <F>mm</F> <SC>bu</SC> <R>sho</R> shopping <SC>of book s</SC> in book store</SC>, I prefer because books are not so expensive, and I enjoy them <F>er</F> for a long time. <F>Mm</F> so, <R>if I</R> if I bought a lot of books, <F>erm</F> <F>erm</F> <SC>it doesn't</SC> it wouldn't cost so much. So I don't need to feel depressed because <SC>I ha</SC> I hadn't spend so much money. "What could I do?". I don't have to be depressed like that. So <F>erm</F> buying book is very fun. And it is also fun to <R>choose my</R> <F>mm</F> choose my clothes. But <F>mm</F> clothes are often <R>very</R> <SC>very high price</SC> very expensive. So <F>erm</F> <R>it's o</R> <SC>it's</SC> of course, it's fun. But, sometimes I found myself very depressed <R>because</R> <F>erm</F> because <F>erm</F> <SC>I use</SC> <SC>I spent a lot of</SC> I spent a lot of money <R>just</R> <F>mm</F> just for clothes. And <SC>clothes</SC> I can't use <SC>clothes</SC> cloth <F>er</F> <SC>so</SC> <F>mm</F> for a long time compared with books. So, sometimes <F>erm</F> buying clothes can depress me.<F>Mm</F>. <R>In most of ca</R> in most case, <F>erm</F> I have a plan. But, sometimes I want <F>mm</F> <R>buy</R> buy clothes, <F>erm</F> suddenly.<F>Mm</F>.
