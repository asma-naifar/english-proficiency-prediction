And sometimes <SC>I</SC> yeah, I feel frustratedyou know, to deal with <F>er</F> elder people.Right.<F>Um</F> because sometimes they think <F>er</F> I'm younger than them, and that's true.But <F>er</F> actually it's sometimes very reluctant to listen to me orthere's <F>uh</F> you know, some game in the classroom. It's like, <F>uh</F> "<F>Oh</F> it's kinda stupid. I don't wanna do it.".But <F>er</F> most of them are very <F>er</F> motivated to learn <SC>sp</SC> you know, English and speak English.I'm really enjoying my job.<F>Er</F> best experience at my <OL>private school</OL>?<F>Oh</F> <SC>one</SC> it just happened last week.And one of my student <SC>w</SC> <F>er</F> really wants to go abroad.<F>Er</F> especially, I think, Australia.She want to get a position of exchange student <?>with a</?> Australian university.But her TOEFL score was really low, and she came to my school to, you know, <F>er</F> score up.And I think we studied together three months. And last week she calls me and she passed the test.Only one student can go to that university.So it was so amazing.That was my best memory <OL><laughter><?>of</?> my job</laughter></OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.<OL>O K</OL>.O K. <F>Er</F> this <SC>lady</SC> <F>er</F> girl is, I think she is in her room.And looking at her pet and cat on the bed.

Maybe she is typing her report or letters. <F>Hmm</F>. Yes.Right.Yes, I do.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Oh</F> you mean with computer or hand writing?It <OL>doesn't matter</OL>?<OL>Paper</OL>.<F>Urm</F> to me, E-mail is more like <F>er</F> <nvs>snap</nvs> <?>right time</?>.So we can, you know, chat on, you know, the Internet or website.<SC>It's more</SC> I can feel the people as doing the same thing at the same time. But <SC>letter is more</SC> <F>mm</F> I don't know how to say it, <SC>more</SC> to me, reading a letter.<SC>It's</SC> there is a distance from the person to person.So yeah, but <SC>I</SC> <F>er</F> personally, I really like E-mail. Because <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F> I can feel how do people feel by Internet. <CO>So</CO>.Yeah.<OL><F>Er</F> favorite</OL> site to visit? <F>Um</F> one favorite site is the Cafe Globe dot com.I think it's only in Japan. But this website is created by all women and for women, especially to work or like <F>er</F> to enjoy their lives.Recently in Japan or other country too, <F>er</F> many women are still working after they get married or yeah, if they have children.So that website is created by women <OL>for women</OL>.So that idea, I really like it.<CO>So</CO>.<F>Oh</F> <SC>my friend</SC> one of my friend <F>er</F> introduced that website to me.Yeah.O K.O K.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Oh</F> yes. <F>Er</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I went to the</SC> let's see, I went to the France<F>er</F> by your package plan<OL>last month</OL>.<F>Er</F> <SC>it wa</SC> <SC>it sho</SC> it was supposed be very gorgeous<OL>and a very</OL> good travel.But it was not good. So I wanted to talk about it.<F>Ah</F> we think hotel was so <?>horrible</?>. The my room, I couldn't get the hot water.<OL>And</OL> I couldn't take even shower in the morning, at night.And the service was really bad.Right. But on your brochure, it says really good service <OL>and</OL>luxurious hotel.<OL>And</OL> it's supposed to be five stars <OL>in France</OL>.So I don't think it's worth to pay such a lots of money.Right.<F>Oh</F> but you know what? I think you wrote <SC>the</SC> that kind of promise on your brochure,so I think you have to do something for me.<F>Oh</F> yes, I did. But <R>they</R> you know, <F>er</F> they <F>er</F> couldn't <F>er</F> listen to me very <F>well</F>. So that's why <F>er</F> I don't speak English very <F>well</F>.So I want to talk about it.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Oh</F> really?<F>Oh</F> <SC>did you</SC> have you contact with them?O K.So yeah, I don't know about others.

But I didn't really care about it.But <F>urm</F> that night, <F>er</F> I felt so bad and <laughter>my brother too</laughter>. And we thought maybe jetlag or time difference.And we didn't really care about it. But it's getting worse.And finally, we decided to go to hospital.But in Thailand, you know what, <F>er</F> people are very poor even Bangkok. So <?>there's</?> a only one hospital. And <nvs>laughter</nvs> we were supposed to go to <F>er</F> <F>urm</F> the castle in Bangkok, but we cancelled that day. And whole family went to the hospital.<F>Er</F> but it was very crowded.And we got to wait for a few hours.I felt so bad. And <F>er</F> you know, I went to the <R>ba</R> bathroom and <OL>back and forth</OL>.<OL>Right</OL>.That was <OL><laughter>a bad memory</laughter></OL>.O K.O K. So it happens before.O K. <nvs>cough</nvs>O K. So O K. Can I start?O K. <F>Ah</F> O K. So let's say this is Tom. Tom is on the way to his office in the morning. O K. So it's a usual day, it's like <F>er</F> eight o'clock. <SC>And</SC> but today, he dropped his bag <F>er</F> in the platform.And right. So he was so scared and he talk to other people, "What should I do?". <SC>And</SC> but other people <?>would</?> say, "<F>Oh</F> no idea. Why don't you talk to like a <F>ur</F> station man?". Or they really didn't care about him. <F>Oh</F> at that time the train came. And <F>oh</F> he was so surprised because his bag is under the train. <SC>And</SC> but after the train passed, his bag was still there. <laughter>So</laughter> <F>wow</F> look at him. He was so, O K, <R>re</R> <F>ur</F> released now. O K. So now he decided to talk to the man in the station. And that man <F>er</F> came down to the platform and picked up his bag and gave it to him. So now he's happy and he finally went to his office.O K. Yes.<F>Er</F> rarely I drive.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Umm</F> I prefer to take trains.I don't know why.<F>Um</F> one thing. <SC>In</SC> especially in Tokyo, parking spot.<F>Ur</F> if I take a train, I don't really care about, you know, parking spotand pay parking fee.And also a traffic jam. I don't really think about this if I take the <F>mm</F> you know, public transportation.That's the <F>ur</F> two <OL>advantage</OL>.And also <F>um</F> it's very, to me, convenient to get different places. Like <F>er</F> first, I want to go to Shibuya, and then I want to go to <F>er</F> Shinjuku. <F>Er</F> all transportation are connected especially in Tokyo.I think it's really good transportation in the world.So that's why, I think, I prefer to take <F>er</F> public transportation.O K.Yes.<F>Er</F> <SC>from</SC> one lesson starts at two.Right. And after <F>uh</F> I have a night class, too.<F>Um</F> our school has a policy to have <F>ur</F> one class, it's for five to eight people.But <F>er</F> like afternoon time, <F>er</F> like housewives and students, so usually two or three students.That's <OL>really small</OL>.<OL><laughter>Yes</laughter></OL>. It's very comfortable.Thank you very much.Yes.
