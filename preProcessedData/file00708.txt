My name is .
. . Fine, thank you.
Everyday? . my life style is different by day by. . So for example, on Monday.
I usually wake up about six o'clock in the morning, and prepare for breakfast, and eat. and then I usually do the preparation for the next day's work.
My work is to attend the seminar.
And study about Japanese language.
Yes. .
Interesting points. . The most interesting points for me is Japanese is my mother tongue. But when we try to study it as a foreign language
 then that Japanese language becomes a different one that I used to know.
Then I can find many interesting things in Japanese language. .
 Yes. A little bit.
 I teach Japanese language to the foreign students. . One class I'm doing is students are about 
twenty students.
And the students are high-level skills in Japanese. So it is not so difficult for me to teach them. mostly I do reading
for them.
 listening to the music is my hobby.
 Rock music.
 Yes.
 Rock music, I don't know why I like rock music. But I think the rock music gives me an experience that I can not have in everyday life.
Yes. .
Yes.
O K. . This young lady teaches maybe mathematics to some students.
 but most of the students don't hear what she is talking.
. this boy
 near the window,
 eating chewing gum. This two girls are talking. And is listening to music. And maybe this boy and this girl study with her I think.
.
 .
. in my high school days, one of the class was similar to this class. And yes. 
 teacher was young lady.
And most of the students didn't hear her. but my policy was listen to the lecture, or lecture in the class room is very important.
But I don't study at home
so many. . .
 . Difficult to explain.
 .
Yes.
.
. For example, Japanese language ,
 I like reading.
So in the class room, I read the text book.
 all the time.
And in the notebook
 in the classroom.
. I think that was good for me. .
.
.
Yes.
. O K. .
 
 in this shop. But when I put it on at home, I didn't like this color. So will you please change another one?
. But this store, the light was , dark. And fitting room was very narrow. So I couldn't see if the color matches me or not.
.
.
. I know, I know.
 . but I think it's not good for you that if I bought this jacket and don't wear.
 .
. But I don't like this kind of color. I like more lighter color.
.
 .

 I think the biggest record store around Tokyo is the H M V shop at Shinjuku south gate.
 nandakkena Do you now Southern Square?
 the H M V shop in the Southern Square, I think it's the biggest store. .
.
. Good. In the H M V, there're some there are some recommended C Ds. So listening to some C D, and decide if you like or don't like is the best way to .
.
O K.

. . . One day last week, I went to the office as usual.
And at the station, I dropped my bag at the platform.
Because the man in front of me was talking loud and making very big gesture.
So I dropped my bag. . Then I said to the man " because of your big gesture, I dropped my bag. So what can you do for me?". . But the man didn't do nothing. So ". Sorry, sorry. But I can't do anything." he said. and then the train came and my bag was still down the platform.
So I was very anxious about if my bag is safe or not. But after the train gone had gone, my bag was safe still between the rail.
And I called the station officer.
And picked my bag he picked my bag. .
.
.

.
.
 . Yes. I think the train needs accurate.
 . For example, the which is shown in the .
And hardly train comes late or comes to soon. I hardly experiences the train comes late in my life. .
 maybe one of the train system, I think.
. Proud. . Maybe it is only in Tokyo, but in Tokyo, we can eat many kind of food from all of the world, .
 . But we can eat anything if we pay money. I think it's one of the feature .
.
After this. this English training program starts for me.
. And from one o'clock
afternoon.
Yes. My first class
 begins.
So I attend the class.
 after that class, I attend my seminar.

Yes. Today.

Thank you very much.
