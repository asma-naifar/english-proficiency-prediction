Good morning.<F>Ur</F> My name is <F>ur</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<F>Ur</F> Please call me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL><F>Ur</F> It's too long</OL>.Fine, thank you. How are you, too?<F>Urm</F> Only been about <R>seven months</R> seven months or so.Yes.Yes, I am a fresh man.<F>Ur</F> I think it's O K. It suits me.<F>Well</F> I belong to the <F>ur</F> accounting department. And <F>um</F> <F>oh</F> <SC><R>I</R> I like figures</SC> <SC>I like looking at</SC> I like analyzing <R>what</R> what <F>ur</F> actual figures mean. And <F>um</F> <SC>I think</SC> <SC>that's</SC> <F>um</F> I thinkI like it.Yes, I am.<F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> I'm not in a accounting division. <SC>I</SC> I'm in the liner division, and I do the accounting for the liner division which means <F>um</F> I don't do the accounting for the whole company. <SC>I</SC> <R>it's</R> it's just divisional <F>ur</F> accounting. And <F>um</F> <R>o</R> <F>u</F> of course accounting skill or knowledge or <F>um</F> <SC>they</SC> <R>that's</R> that's required. I now been studying that <F>ur</F> <SC>when I</SC> since I came into the company. And, <F>um</F> <F>well</F> yeah, basic <R>accoun</R> accounting skills and <F>um</F> <R>what</R> what the figures mean and <F>ur</F> <SC>actual</SC> yeah, <R>that's</R> that's about it.<F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> basically the accounting skill or knowledge I read books or the company <R>let</R> <SC>let</SC> lets me <F>urm</F> go to accounting schools. <F>Uh</F> <R>Not</R> <R>not</R> not at the moment. But <R>I</R> I went to <F>urm</F> several accounting schools in May and June. And <F>um</F> <F>well</F> <SC><R>to</R> to figure out <SC>what accounting</SC> what <R>the</R> the figures mean for each</SC> <F>urm</F> <R>what</R> what the actual figures mean, or after <SC>I look at <F>um</F> of</SC> I look at a lot of <F>ur</F> <SC>books</SC> <F>mm</F> accounting books and then I calculate <R>how</R> how the figures calculate. Yeah.Weekends.<SC>I'm</SC> <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I do athletics. <R>I</R> <F>ur</F> I do long distances. And <F>urm</F> <SC>this Fri</SC> <SC>this, no</SC> <SC>this Saturday, no</SC> this Sunday, I'm going to be running a <SC>marathon</SC> full marathon. So I've been practicing for that on weekends.Yeah.Yeah. <SC?>It so</SC?> <SC>it's just</SC> <F>ur</F> you know, <R>it's</R> <R>it's</R> it's like <F>ur</F> when New York Marathon where all citizens take part. I do it. That's <F>ur</F> Kawaguchi <JP>ko</JP> Lake in <F>ur</F> <SC>Yamaguchi</SC> Yamanashi Prefecture. <F>Urm</F> <R>Have you</R> have you been to Kawaguchi <JP>ko</JP>?<F>Well</F> you sort of <R>run</R> run the lake twice. And <R>that</R> that makes forty two point one nine five kilo meters. It's my fifth challenge.Running. <F>Ur</F> <F>Well</F> <R>I</R> I started running when I came into university, that was my first time. <SC>I did</SC> <R>I</R> I didn't belong <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to <F>ur</F> athletic club when I was in a senior high school. But <F>ur</F> I was pretty fast. And <F>um</F> I'm good at long distances <SC>although I was</SC> <F>um</F> though I didn't belong to the athletic club. And <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> I thought I might, you know, start.No, <SC>I no</SC> <R>I</R> I didn't actually. <F>Ur</F> <SC>I was</SC> no, I didn't.<F>Ur</F> No. <nvs>laughter</nvs> I mean <F>ur</F> I don't think I have the rights to comment <F>ur</F> about her because <F>ur</F> <R>she's</R> she's most professional, and <F>ur</F> most fastest runner in the world,I think.<F>Ohh</F> This is a picture <F>ur</F> of <F>ur</F> class room, I think about <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <R>junior high</R> junior high school. <SC>Teach</SC> the teacher is teaching <SC>math</SC> mathematics to the students although only a few of the students <SC>are listening to her</SC> listen to her. And <F>ur</F> most of the students are doing something else.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> <F>ur</F> one, I think because students aren't interested in mathematics. And two, <F>mm</F> because <F>mm</F> probably <R>the</R> the way the teacher teaches is not that good at all. She's not teaching mathematics interesting. Or three, <SC>probably</SC> <F>urm</F> it's probably nothing to do with examination.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Very good question. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> usually, mathematics teachers, they try to describe everything using <F>ur</F> figures. But <F>urm</F> <R>if</R> if she's not interesting or most of the students aren't interested in figures, that <F>urm</F> if the teacher tries to explain everything in figures, I guess <R>it'll</R> it'll be difficult <F>ur</F> interest the students. So I think the teachers should <F>urm</F> explain mathematics rather not using figures, but using something else. Using like words or <F>ur</F> examples that are more close to you.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F> <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> <F>urm</F> pretty much the same, I think. But <F>um</F> I think I listened to the teacher.But I think I was listening to the teacher. Pretty much the same, I think.<F>Mm</F>Students. <F>Um</F> <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> this is much worse, I think than my high school days. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> first of all, we didn't have cell phones in a high school days. So no one was playing around with cell phones, but there were students chatting or chewing gums or drinking or listening to music. So yeah, I guess pretty much the same.<SC>Y</SC> O K.<OL><F>Uhu</F></OL><F>Ur</F> Hello.<F>Ur</F> Hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. <F>Ur</F> Hi, <F>ur</F> yes.<F>Ur</F> This is <F>ur</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>'s calling.<F>Urm</F> Terribly sorry. <F>Urm</F> There's <F>ur</F> nothing I can do about it. <F>Urm</F> <F>well</F> <SC>I was trying to</SC> <F>uh</F> I was on my way to my garage.

And <F>urm</F> I can't do that.No. That <R>I</R> I'm sure he likes parties <SC>more</SC> rather than driving.<F>Uhh</F> <F>um</F> Just <F>ur</F> <F>urm</F> sorry, I'm sorry, too, actually.

O K.<F>Uh</F> O K. <F>Uh</F> Start off with this.

On the other hand, <F>urm</F> Steve on his motorbike was also going back home. Now <SC>he was</SC> Steve was <F>urm</F> visiting his <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> <R>girl friend's place</R> girl friend's place with his motorbike. However, he wasn't concentrating on driving. He was <?>also</?> concentrating on talking with his girl friend. And the accident happens. <F>Ur</F> When John tried to turn left, <F>ur</F> <SC>Steve</SC> <R>he</R> <F>ur</F> he <?>winds</?> Steve. However John quickly turned his handle, and avoided the accident. However Steve <F>urr</F> no, he didn't <laughter>avoid accident</laughter>. <F>Urm</F> <R>He avoided</R>, yeah he avoided <F>ur</F> <SC>tragedy</SC> a big accident. <R>However</R> <.></.> however <F>ur</F> <SC>he</SC> the car didn't hit Steve himself but it hit Steve's motorbike. On the other hand, <F>urr</F> when John hit a <F>urr</F> Steve's motorbike, Steve <SC>throw</SC> <F>ur</F> dropped his cell phone which means that <F>ur</F> Steve broke both his motorbike and his cell phone. Steve claims that it was John's fault. And <F>urm</F> they decided to call the police <R>to see</R> to see what was the cause of the accident, and <F>ur</F> who's fault was it. <SC>They both explained</SC> <R>when the</R> when the police man came, they both explained the police man what happened.

So he drove off. However Steve whose motorbike was broken and <F>urm</F> could not be used for driving, decided <SC>to call the</SC> to call engineer nearby, and took his motorbike to the engineer.Now, <F>well</F><F>well</F> I mean Steve <SC>shouldn't have</SC> <F>urm</F> <SC>shouldn't</SC> <R>should not</R> should not have been talking with the cell phone when he was driving. I don't think there's any fault with John.Yeah, I think so.<F>Ur</F> I've never hit someone else's car or bike or person.Yes, I do.<F>Uh</F> <F>Well</F> <F>um</F> <SC>movements</SC> movement of people and movement of cars or movement of those anything that moves I keep my eye on.It's not difficult.
