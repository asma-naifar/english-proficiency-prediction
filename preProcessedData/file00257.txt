One day last week, a boy happened to meet one of his they hadn't met since graduation day. got really excited and glad to meet the boy. And he would like to know how the boy was doing. took him to the nearest restaurant. they chose at the table the man recommended some of the good dishes thought he would the boy was a college student then, and he turned out to be twenty years old. So, he ordered a beer. and they delicious alcohol. And they talked about the the boy's high school days. And the boy told the teacher what he what he was doing or what he was going to do. And to listen to the boy. And fish the boy had the fish and the teacher had meat. And they had more than enough each other to see again and told the boy anyone he told to the boy that to he was always ready to be there for some boy has something to discuss solve. And they said good-bye and departed.
 I like so-called "family restaurant". And because dishes. And I don't like meat. Minced meat is O K, but steak or usual meat, I can't eat those things. So, when we go to anything.
