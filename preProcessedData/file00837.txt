.
. Very tough. .
 in what sense?  you know, the  is already big enough, but the company want me to grow further.
 the other brand, , the market size is quite small, but    we have to have more sales. But,  at the moment, the brand itself is not profitable.
Because now styling market is small but very competitive.  every six month, we have to launch new product.
So we need the investment and also support for the brand.
 very, very money consuming business. So it's very tough. .

It's   throwing snowball each other, and   hit the snowball. And,  on the left  upper side,    it's some kind of house or clubhouse, something like that. And  someones are drinking tea or coffee there.   and  there is a,   lift  on the right-hand side, but  nobody on the lift at this moment. And       someones are not so good at skiing, so I think he is  almost  buried in a snow.
 And   on the just  top of  the burying guy, the,    I think, guy is doing snowboarding, and  he may hits him.

 O K.  this is in the morning at around eight o'clock. And a  businessman went to the station  to go to the office.
And, on the platform, he dropped his bag on the rail place.   but that is not his fault. And someone next to him did something, maybe,  hit the elbow to his arm. And he dropped it. And then, he complained about it to the person who did such a thing. And,  maybe,   he asked him to  pick it up.  And, after that, the train came in, and  his bag was almost knock down  or crashed or pressed. But,   after the  train went out, he found his bag is safe. Then, he asked a station staff to pick it up. And, finally he got the bag back.
Yes.
Never.
.
 I gonna ask  the station staff to pick up because it's very dangerous. And also, especially in the morning,
there're train  come to the platform so often, so I don't do it. .
.
.
. It's very, very naughty. I don't like it.  sometimes I feel like, how can I say,    hit them.
 I've never done.
Yeah.
. All right. Tomorrow, we gonna have  party
, because   we will get  free beef about six hundred grams.
 I invite my subordinate, one subordinate, and  my girlfriend will invite her friends.
And we  have party.
No, not at all.
 it's like a lottery.
 very much.
.
 very much.
Bye.
