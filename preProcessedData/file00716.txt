Hello.
My name is .
O K.
. I'm fine, thank you.
 and you?
.
  I ate  stamina lunch in  Cafeteria.
   it was  made of beef and onion and pilaf.
 . It tastes  good. . But I think it  a little bad.
.
.    its quality is bad.
 its quantity is cheap.
  I usually go to  Cafeteria.
 It is very large, and  it has many menu, and the price is reasonable. And  I can find    many my friends  there. . And   I can go there  soon after the class.
Yes.  I'm busy because   on next Saturday, my band's live will be holding  so I must practice the songs every day.
And I go to the studio with my band   almost on every nights.
  I will go to the studio today, too.
Yes.
My band plays  punk rock music. But sometimes we play pop music. For example, Beatles.   and  I play base in my band. But sometimes I take a vocalist.  . But  I'm  poor at singing a song. So    I sometimes feel    shy.
 I like both.
Both.
     ,    music line of punk rock music is very easy. So    we can play punk rock music easily. And  when we play punk rock music in our live,   it makes listeners very excited.
.   a boy and girl   drink a coffee in the log house. And  the man in  black ski wear  is 
.
. Yes. I enjoy. I like ski and snowboard.
. Snowboarding is very easy  . . And  even the beginners of snowboarding   can enjoy it. But   skiing is very difficult.  Sometimes the beginners go skiing can't enjoy it. . And  they say,  " I won't try it again.".  but   when the beginner of skiing  do the snowboarding, they say,  "This is good,   I will try it again and again.".
But    snow boarding is more dangerous than skiing because   snowboarding's top speed is very fast.
Faster than skiing.
O K.
 I want to go to New York   as soon as possible. So what kind of ticket should I buy?

. Because    I can enjoy the scene of beauty, and   I don't need to try  drive a car.
  and  I can sleep  in the train.
   these days  I can't remember.
 I travel by bus 
almostly.
  my latest trip is the   training camp of my circles. It uses bus.
And the trip of my family uses my father's car.  My family always uses my father's car. So  I rarely   use train.
Pardon? I'm sorry. I beg your pardon?

 I like C D shops. For example, Tower Records and H M V  because   I am a musician  so I like to listen to music.
