<F>Urr</F>. Yes. I'm ready, but a little bit nervous.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F>. Yes. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Nice to meet you, too.<F>Urr</F>. I live in <R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H></R><H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City.<F>Urrr</F>. It's good, really good because it's quiet. And we have a lot of greens.So I think it's good.O K. I have been teaching English to the students of junior and senior school.And <F>ur</F> I have been working in one of the private schools in Tokyo for about <laughter>nearly twenty years</laughter>. And I think I like my job<OL>because</OL> I like children.I really like to talk with them.Yes, <laughter>I do</laughter>.I do have some difficulties, of course.O K. I'm in charge of the senior two students right now. And, when they were junior one students, one of my students <F>urr</F> <.></.> escaped from <.></.> her home <OL>in the middle of night</OL>.And <SC>she wa</SC> <F>urr</F> <.></.> her parents didn't know where she was. And <F>ur</F> that was the big problem.<F>Urm</F>. We talked with her parents, and we talked with herself, too. But <F>er</F> we couldn't find any good solution. So she quit our school when she was in <.></.> junior three student.Yes, it was.<OL><F>Urrm</F></OL>. That's one of the biggest problems I've got <OL><laughter>at the moment</laughter></OL>.So I sometimes <F>urr</F> <R>go to</R> <.></.> go to see <F>ur</F> Kabuki play or <??></??> concertsand <.></.> something like that.Yeah.<F>Urr</F>. First of all, the clothes of Kabuki players are really really beautiful to see. And <F>ur</F> I could be <.></.> immerse into the Japanese old time. <.></.> <CO>So</CO>. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.><.></.> I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.<F>Urrr</F>. What do I usually do? I don't know, <F>urm</F> <.></.> because I don't always monitor myself. <CO>So</CO>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>Sometimes, I listen to music.I love pop music and the rock music. So my favorite group is U TWO.<OL>So</OL> I'm really glad to see the Grammy Award's results.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urm</F>. The lyrics of the songs are really <R>socia</R> social ones. So <.></.> that's why I love them. And <R>the</R> the melody itself is appealing to me.<F>Urm</F>. What do you mean? <F>Urr</F>. <.></.> <R>Their</R> <.></.> their melodies, <F>urm</F> <JP>nan daro</JP>, let me do my work<laughter><??></??></laughter> or <??></??>.<nvs>laughter</nvs> Thank you.<F>Urm</F>. <.></.> The teacher is teaching mathematics to the students. But <F>urr</F> <.></.> very few students are listening to her. And one of the students is chewing a gum. And <F>urr</F> the other student is <.></.> <F>urr</F> using <SC>cell phones</SC>cell phone. And <F>ur</F> one of the boy students <.></.> is listening to music and drinking somethings. And two of the girls are chatting with each other, and they're not attending <.></.> class. <F>Mm</F>. <SC>And also</SC> <.></.> but <SC>the teacher didn't</SC> <F>urm</F> the teacher doesn't seem to pay any attention to the students,<.></.> I think.<SC>And</SC> but only one boy student is eagerly <F>uh</F> listening to her. <.></.> He's really <.></.> a studious student,<.></.> maybe.<.></.> I don't think her attitude <SC>is not</SC> is good.Because <F>urr</F> <.></.> probably she <.></.> is a little bit nervous, and, <F>er</F> probably her experience is not so <.></.> much. So she doesn't know how to control the students.So <SC>she should <.></.> ha</SC> she should get more experiences.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> <F>Urm</F>. Probably, <.></.> <SC>at the very first</SC> in the very first lesson, I would ask the students <F>ur</F> what kind of <.></.> mathematical points they're interested in. And, <nvs>laughter</nvs> <SC>we ask</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <F>ur</F> probably, I will <.></.> get to hints to teach those kinds of students <.></.> by asking a lot of questions.Role play?<laughter><F>Ohh</F></laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs>O K.<F>Er</F>. Yes, please. <.></.> <F>Urm</F>. I bought <.></.> <F>er</F> the suitin your store.And <F>urr</F> I really <SC>liked it</SC> <SC>liked them</SC> liked it, <F>ur</F> when I bought it. But, once I <.></.> came back home, and I put on the suit, I didn't like it. So I would like you to exchange another one.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urr</F>. Yes. <R>I</R> <F>urr</F> <.></.> I didn't check any details when I bought it. <SC>So</SC> <F>urm</F> <.></.> but you recommended it to me, <.></.> saying, <F>urm</F> "It's really good suit.".So I bought it. But, <F>urm</F> when I checked it at home, <F>urm</F> <.></.> size doesn't fit me well.Also the zipper doesn't work well.<F>Urrm</F>. <SC>The</SC> <.></.> <R>it doesn't wo</R> it doesn't work, <F>urr</F> 'cos <R>I</R> I couldn't close the zipper. <CO>So</CO>.And also, the hem <F>er</F> <SC>doesn't</SC> <.></.> <F>er</F> isn't fit. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.<F>Oh</F>.

O K. <OL>I'll be back</OL>.O K. I'll talk to him.Thank you very much.<?>It's really good</?>. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Oh</F> yeah. Not myself, but one of my <.></.> friends. But I don't remember it <OL>well</OL>.<SC>Yes, I do</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>yes, I did</SC> yes, I have.In Australia.<F>Oh</F>. <.></.> Australian shops and Japanese shops? <.></.> In any kinds?<F>Urrr</F>. <.></.> <F>Oh-oh</F>. <.></.> I can't think <.></.> any particular differences. <F>Uhm</F>. <.></.> <F>Ahhh</F>. <F><?>Well</?></F>. The difference would be <F>er</F> <.></.> the <.></.> sales persons. The Japanese sales persons are eager to sell <.></.> anything.But <F>urrr</F> <.></.> Australian sales persons <.></.> don't feel like that.They seem <F>urm</F> <.></.> relaxing, and, <F>ur</F> before pushing <.></.> the customers <SC>to buy something</SC> <F>er</F> to sell something, <F>urm</F> <.></.> they chat with the customers first.And, <F>ur</F> <.></.> first of all, they lets the customers relaxed and <F>ur</F> pleased, and <F>ur</F> <.></.> free to talk anything. And, after that, <.></.> probably, the customers would ask <.></.> <SC>something they want</SC>something they're looking for.And <.></.> then, the sales persons are ready to sell them.<F>Mh-huh</F>. <.></.> Do I have to name the person?<F>Uhmm</F>. <.></.> <F>Mm-hm</F>. One day last week, <.></.> my brother <.></.> went to the station as usual around eight o'clock in the morning. And, <F>ur</F> while he was waiting for the train to come, he dropped his bag <.></.> <SC>under the platform</SC> on the rail. And <F>er</F> <R>he</R> <.></.> <SC>he asked what he can do</SC> he asked one of the passengers <.></.> <R>who</R> who is also waiting for the train what <SC>he can</SC> he could do. But the person <.></.> who was asked didn't know what to do. <.></.> <SC>And</SC> <.></.> but, next moment, as the train <.></.> <SC>came to the station</SC> arrive to the station, and <.></.> he was really afraid the train crashed his bag. <.></.> But, fortunately, <.></.> <SC>it was the express</SC> it was an express train, so <.></.> it didn't stop at the station, and it went through the station. So his bag was <.></.> safe. And he was really relieved to know that. And, after that, he asked one of the station's clerks. And <R>the</R> <.></.> the person <F>ur</F> <.></.> fell down to the <.></.> rail and <SC>got the bag</SC> <SC>got his bag, and back</SC> <.></.> got it back to him.<.></.> At the moment, the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Line, I think.<.></.> That's a little bit awful.Because, on the <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Line, we have a lot of accidents, especially suicide accidents.<OL>And</OL> also, it's always crowded. <SC>And</SC> so I think it's a little bit awful nowadays.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <.></.> <F>Uhmm</F>. <.></.> It could have been helped.<.></.> Because he was on the way to his work. So <.></.> <R>he</R> <.></.> he didn't want to be bothered <SC>with such of tiny thing</SC> <.></.> with such kind of tiny thing. <.></.> He could have picked it up, but <.></.> that was not his obligation.You're welcome. Thank you very much.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Yeah.No.<OL>Not in particular</OL>.Yes.No. <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Line.From here.<OL>No, I don't have to</OL>.<OL><F>Urr</F></OL> <F>urm</F>. <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> Line. I use <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Station.<OL>Yes, or</OL> I can use <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> City Bus. <.></.> City bus is a small bus.<F>Urm</F>. One of the <SC><H pn="others6">XXX08</H> line</SC> <H pn="others6">XXX08</H> bus lines.No.Not really. The same <OL>price</OL>.Thank you very much.Thank you.
