<F>Um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sure.Fine, thank you. How about you?<F>Er</F> not yet.Probably yes.<F>Hm</F> I think I'm gonna go home first and then relax a little bit. And then maybe I'm gonna cook something for myself.<F>Hmm</F>.<F>Er</F> I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. Right.<H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <F>Well</F> <F>um</F> there are so many people living there. <SC>But <F>er</F> not</SC> <F>er</F> <F>hmm</F> <SC>I don't kno</SC> I can't find any good points of living there but it's just a quiet town to live. And then <F>um</F> for example on weekends, <F>er</F> sometimes you have to dress up to go to a convenient store, right? But <F>um</F> it's not that kind of town. So I can wear jersey and then <F>er</F> I don't have to wear a makeup to go out. So it's <F>er</F> very comfortable, in a way, <OL>to live</OL>.<OL>You don't have</OL> to worry anything at all.It's not my hometown but I'm from <F>er</F> <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.<F>Hmm</F>.<H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>. Right.Right. I was born in <F>er</F> January.So my mom gave me this name.<F>Hm</F>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> it's kind of difficult, because I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> when I was really, really young. <SC>So that time, I think</SC> until I was a high school student, I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And then, I think <F>well</F> when I have to live in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, then I have to get a driver's license because <F>er</F> <SC>there are no shopping place that you can</SC> <F>er</F> <F>hm</F> there's no shopping place. And then you always have to <SC>drive a</SC> drive your car to go somewhere. So it's really <SC>unconvenient</SC>inconvenient.But again, it's really quiet and then I can enjoy nature a lot. Yeah. So but in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H>, probably, there are so many people <SC>and then</SC> <F>er</F> everywhere I go. And then <F>er</F> sometimes that makes me <F>er</F> feel uncomfortable.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<OL>But that's O K</OL>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.<F>Um</F> since I love watching movies and I often watch movies at home. I love to go see a movie in a theater but I don't have time to go.<OL>So</OL> these days, I tend to stay home and <F>er</F> watch movies. But the problem is that <F>um</F> I'm tired, working hard. So <F>um</F> I tend to sleepwhen I <OL>watch movies</OL>.Recently. It's a difficult question.<OL><SC>I canno</SC></OL> <F>hmm</F> I can't remember but <F>er</F> last one. Probably I saw the "Unusual Suspect". <OL>I think <R>that was</R> that was the title</OL>.<F>Hm</F>. Unusual?<F>Hm</F>.Suspect.<F>Hm</F>.Right, right, <OL>right, right</OL>.<F>Hm</F>.<OL>Right</OL>. <F>Um</F> first of all, usually I ask my friends who knows a lot about movies. And <F>eh</F> if they say <SC>it's</SC> it was a good movie, then I just rent it. So there is no special reason. But sometimes I check the trailer on T V. And then if <.></.> it looks interesting, then I would go see a movie. But <F>hmm</F> again it's kind of difficult.<OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.O K.O K. So can I start?O K. There is a room of a young girl. And then <F>er</F> <SC>she is</SC> I guess she is using a computer. And then <F>er</F> she is showing something to her pets. But <F>er</F> the pets are sleeping, a cat is sleeping on the bed and then a dog is on the floor. And then <F>er</F> I don't know why she has a typewriter next to computer. Maybe she use both. And then <F>er</F> it's, I guess, nine o'clock. <F>Er</F> probably this is a weekend. So she is relaxing herself a little bit in a room. And then <F>er</F> also the door is open.<F>Mh-hmm</F>.<F>Er</F> I usually check E-mails because <F>um</F> <F>uh</F> <SC>I have to check my E-mails to</SC> <F>uh</F> because some people send me some E-mails about my work so I have to check it every night. It's kind of annoying because sometimes I get a lot of E-mail but I'm too busy to check but I have to respond it quickly. <SC>So</SC> but <F>er</F> I think it's useful to use it.And then sometimes I <F>er</F> buy a ticket<SC><R>to</R> to</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, next month the Yankees gonna come to play. <F>Er</F> so I got a ticket last time<F>er</F> through the Internet. And then it was really convenient. So I think <SC>i</SC> the computer itself, it's a very good tool.Right. <OL>I guess so</OL>.<F>Hm</F>. I agree with it. <F>Hmm</F>. Because <F>um</F> I usually don't <F>er</F> read newspapers. But when I check the Internet, then I can get all kinds of news from all over the world. So yeah. And then <F>er</F> for example, some of my friends are in United States. And then they wrote me something by E-mail and then, you know, they tell me something big happened over there. And then so <OL><??></??></OL>.O K.O K.Sure.<F>Hm</F>.<F>Hm</F>. I'm ready.<F>Um</F> hi. This is <F>er</F> <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H> speaking.<F>Um</F> I'm sorry that <F>uh</F> I couldn't <F>er</F> attend the party <SC>yesterday</SC> last night, actually.I'm so sorry. <F>Um</F> I was trying to call you but your line was busy. So I couldn't reach you. <CO>And</CO>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.Right. <F>Er</F> there was a big accident happened. So <F>um</F> I was in a hurry. And then that time, I forgot to call you. I was completely out of my mind. And then <F>er</F> I had to go back to my <F>er</F> hometown to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> because my mom <F>er</F> she called me. And then said <SC>she had a</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, she fell down from stairs. And then <F>er</F> that time, she was in hospital. So I had to go see her.Right, right, right. But <F>er</F> since my brother is in <H pn="others4">XXX06</H> and then my father, he was away from home. So and then <SC>I think my mom was really worried about</SC> <F>um</F> I don't know, she didn't know what to do. So probably she called me. And then <F>er</F> <SC>she looked very</SC> I mean, she sounded very upset. So.<OL>I'm sorry</OL>.Right. I know. So I'm gonna call them. And then say sorry. And then probably <..></..> <F>um</F> I'm gonna tell them what happened yesterday.<F>Oh</F>.She's O K.Yeah.<OL>So</OL> <F>um</F> but next time, if you have a party, another one, please invite me again.<CO>Or <F>um</F> maybe <R>I</R> I might have <SC>someone</SC> something <OL>or probably, but</CO></OL>.<F>Hm</F>.Thank you.<F>Er</F> not really. <F>Hm</F>. <F>Um</F> again, on weekends I have to work sometimes. I mean these days I have to work. So I really don't have time for myself either.So again, <F>ur</F> like when I have some free time, I have to do like <F>er</F> I have to wash my clothes and I have to clean up my room and so on. So I really don't have time to go out with my friends.<F>Ah</F> last time. That was <F>er</F> <SC>this year</SC> at the beginning of this year. I was in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. And then <F>er</F> that was <F>er</F> during New Year holidays. And then <F>er</F> <SC>we didn't do something special</SC> <F>er</F> I mean, <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> my family and I didn't do something special. But <R>we just</R> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> we just stayed in a room and then watched T V. That's all, <?>I think</?>.<OL><F>Hm</F></OL>.O K.O K. Can I start?O K. So one day last week, <F>um</F> my boyfriend was driving a car to go to his office. And then the other guy who was on a scooter, he was talking on a cellphone. <SC>And then all of a sudden</SC> probably his girlfriend called him and then <F>er</F> he was talking on a phone. And then probably he was careless. <F>Er</F> he didn't know that <SC>my boyfriend</SC> the car was coming towards him. And then <F>er</F> <.></.> <SC>some</SC> <F>er</F> the guy <F>er</F> dropped his cellphone <R>and then</R> and then <F>er</F> my boyfriend was really surprised. And then <F>er</F> <SC>prob</SC> <F>er</F> he didn't hit <F>er</F> his motorbike. But <F>um</F> <F>um</F> he stopped the car. And then the guy on a <F>er</F> <SC>scooter</SC> motorbike complained that his cellphone was broken. And then the police came. And then my boyfriend explained what happened. And then he said <SC>he</SC> that <F>er</F> the accident wasn't his fault. <.></.> And then the police wrote some report. And then finally, the truck cake and then <F>er</F> the guy towed a motorbike to a repair shop.No.<F>Hmm</F>.Never.<F>Hmm</F>.<F>Hm</F>. But sometimes <SC>I can</SC> <F>er</F> it's useful <R>to</R> <SC>to like</SC> <F>er</F> to get something, to get a ticket. Like sometimes people have to check my name, <OL>you know, whether it's right person or not</OL>.Then I can show my driver's license as an I D. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Ah</F> not yet. <F>Um</F> mine is <F>er</F> blue.Right.Right. <OL><CO>It's <?>a quite</?></CO></OL>.<F>Hm</F>.Yeah.O K.<F>Um</F> yes, <R>I have</R> I have to work tonight.<F>Hm</F>.
