. One day last week, it rained a lot.
And a couple is walking on the street. So let me describe the picture. One. They are talking. They looks to be very happy because the man loves the woman and the woman loves the man. Yeah. They loves each other. . So no problem about rain. And, yeah, I move on number two. he hears the voice. But he doesn't know. And number three. she found the cat, but the cat appears to be very tired. and it looks to be dying and she picked up the cat. number four. she asked him to bring the cat to the hospital. "Please, please.". But he declined the offer. Next. she hugged the cat because the cat is very cold and is dying. So he was in trouble because he is not a good person for the cat. And finally, he decided to go to the hospital to bring the cat. And one umbrella with her.

No.
No, I haven't.
 I hate it.
Because the voice of cats, I don't like.
.
.
Yeah. Maybe I will ignore.
. .
 I don't feel guilty.
Because it doesn't matter for me.
Yeah. you think I'm a bad person.
. But yeah, in fact, I'm a good person.
 I always take an umbrella with me but I sometimes forget my umbrella. when I forget umbrella, I buy new umbrella in a convenience store. . And I use it. for me, the rain doesn't matter.
.
Yeah. But I often forget on a train.
. .
Yeah, plus-minus zero.
About three average.

Yeah. I'm busy now.
 maybe in the midnight.

Yeah, I have to be healthy but I'm not .
Thank you.
