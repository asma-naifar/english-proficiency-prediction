And <R>we have</R> <SC>we have every sub</SC> <F>eh</F> <F>ur</F> we have special courses for every subject in school. So I think <F>mm</F> this is one of the biggest university in Japan.<F>Um</F>. I am majoring in English education, and I'm a graduate student here. And this is my last year. And I'm now working on my thesis. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Uhh</F>. I feel very sad actually because I'm going back to my hometown next spring. And this year would be my last year in Tokyo also. So after writing my thesis, I'm planning to go out many fun places in Tokyo.<F>Um</F>. I'm from <H pn="others3">XXX06</H>, and my hometown is famous for rice, Uonuma Koshihikari. And we have lots of mountain, and we can enjoy skiing in winter. <F>Urm</F> <F>oh</F> and my hometown has a <JP>shinkansen</JP> station. But <nvs>laughter</nvs> around the station, we can see only rice fields, and <nvs>laughter</nvs> no other buildings are higher than the <JP>shinkansen</JP> station there.<F>Uhm</F> <F>uum</F> <F>well</F> I can not really compare it to other kinds, but my father always tells me that the Koshihikari rice is the best one in Japan, and I believe <R>in</R> in him so. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><R><F>Well</F></R> <F>well</F> I know they are very good when it gets cold.And yeah, shines <nvs>laughter</nvs> like pearlsand beautiful.Yes.<F>Mhm</F>.O K. <F>Um</F>. A girl is in her own room, and she is sitting in front of her computer. And she keeps two animals. One is dog, and another is a cat. And they're also in her room. And she has a big bed and <.></.> big stereo set and her own telephone and some books and nice blue clock on the wall. And it seems to be in June because she has a calendar of June. <F>Uh</F> also she has a typewriter of pink color. So maybe she's working on something, maybe thesis. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Uum</F></OL> <F>well</F>, <.></.> it looks very similar to my own room because I have computer and stereo set <SC>and m</SC> and bed and clock. But I don't have pets because I'm living in a <?>friend</?>, <R>not</R> not <?>right</?> room. So I'm not allowed to keep any kinds of pets in my room. But I think her room is little bit wider than mine. And little bit cleaner maybe. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Well</F> I like my room though.Yes.Yes.<nvs>laughter</nvs> It's a tough question. <F>Urm</F> <R>I</R> <SC>I have just</SC> <F>urr</F> I've just got my <F>um</F> questionnaires turned back from my participants. And I have to start typing in my <SC>other results</SC> <?>answer of</?> questionnaires with my computer. And also I have to look for so many examples from previous studies.

Really? <F>Um</F> but my friend is getting married tomorrow, and I really need the dress for tomorrow's party. And <SC>I can't</SC> I don't have enough money to buy another dress by tomorrow. So <F>um</F> I don't care about colors. So if I can find any kinds of dress that <SC>fits</SC> just fit me, so please could you <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>uh</F> exchange the dress to another one? If it costs little bit higher, I can pay for that. But <SC>I can'</SC> I don't have <F>um</F> money to buy another dress so please. <nvs>laughter</nvs>All right. <R>If I can</R> <F>ah</F> if I can talk to your boss,<F>um</F> would that be possible to ask him to give me different kinds of dress with the same cost?<F>Ahh</F> <F>oh</F> no. <F>Uhh</F> <F>well</F> what can I do? <F>Um</F>. <R>How about</R> how about I work here for one day instead so you can take off one day?

And <.></.> <SC>if I like the design</SC> <R>eve</R> <F>uh</F> even if I liked the design, I may not like how I look in the dress. So I try for sure. <SC>So</SC> but after trying, it makes me nervous to say that <R>I'm</R> I'm not going to buy this and da da da da da. <SC>So</SC> but <R>I</R> I'm always trying to be honest what I think about the dress so. <OL><F>Uhm</F></OL>.And <R>I</R> I decide the budget before I go to a store so that I don't spend all the money.<OL>Thank you</OL>.Yeah.<F>Hum</F> <F>hum</F>.O K.
