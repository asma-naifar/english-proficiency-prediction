One day last week, I was very hungry but      eat something.  when I opened the refrigerator, there's no food. And  I went to the supermarket and select the some food and     buy the some food,  meat and vegetables and cans. And    I pick them to my car. And I cooked the sunny-side up. I'm very happy.

 Supermarket.      I like supermarket more  because    I have so many select.   I can easily find the things or food I want,  for example,  one of my favorite sweets,  chocolate  . In convenience store,  sometimes I couldn't find this item. But  many time I can found this chocolate at the supermarket.
