But the coat has some holes at <F>um</F> the shoulder part and I didn't notice that there was the hole <SC>in the</SC> in this coat yesterday. And like when I came back, I noticed that there was a hole. So <F>um</F> I'd like to change this coat to new onelike if possible.Policy. Against policy. This has hole.<OL>The day</OL> before yesterday. I came here yesterday.So maybe between the day before yesterday and yesterday, be some bad customer,they tried this coat and maybe <F>er</F> stuck in some place and this got hole.I really like this coat because this design is my favorite.And I like this color.And I like your shop. I always <R>come here</R> come here and always buy something.Fix it?Fix it. Does it cost any?<F>Er</F> you know, <R>I</R> <SC>I've never</SC> I even didn't put on this coat.<OL>So it's</OL> really brand-new.And I'd like to change.<F>Ah</F> or can you please <F>er</F> order <R>another</R> <SC>another this coa</SC> another<OL>coat</OL>.<F>Uh</F> <SC>that's</SC> it's O K.

So of course it has holes and some paint or <F>er</F> maybe some soy sauce. <laughter>Maybe</laughter>. But I know that <SC>that</SC> this clothes is that's something that the other people already wore or had. So I accept those holes andsome paint.So if I go to a brand-new store <SC>and</SC> which is like very expensive clothes, <F>er</F> <R>I would</R> I would do the same thing that I did.Yeah.Yes. Sometimes, of course, saving money, sometimes it looks better than brand-new one.<F>Hm</F>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Mh-hmm</F>.<OL>O K</OL>. The last week,I was walking with my girlfriend. And it was rainy. And <R>when</R> <F>uh</F> <R>when</R> <F>er</F> <R>when we</R> when we were going to <F>er</F> my apartment, I heard something and something really cute. And I listened carefully. And my girlfriend found the box and the box had a cat in it. And <R>I said</R> <SC>I said we</SC> I said I cannot accept and <SC>keep my</SC> keep <F>er</F> any animals in <F>uh</F> my apartment. But <R>my girl</R> <F>mm</F> my girlfriend said <F>er</F> "Please. <R>I really like</R> I really like cats and please, let's keep <SC>this animal</SC> this cat together.".

My home in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.<F>Urm</F> I don't like people who just <SC>gave up some</SC> <R>gi</R> give up something that because someone cannot take responsibility. But once you take some responsibilities, finishing the responsibility or <F>er</F> <R>finishing his</R> finishing his task or her task is necessary.And if I see some guy leaves the cats, <SC?>I don't re</SC?> <SC?>the</SC?> I don't like that. So I just probably tell him and not to do that.And think about again.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> Yes. I really liked the birdbut <OL>my sister</OL><SC>didn't</SC> <R>hated</R> hated the bird because of the looks. I don't know why she didn't like that bird. <SC>But</SC> so <SC>she just gave</SC> she's decided to <F>um</F> give the bird to our cousin.So I did not finish my responsibility, <?>but it's</?> depends on her. So<??></??>.Sure.This test?<F>Er</F> I have a drinking party with my friends.<SC>And</SC> because I'm over twenty.So <nvs>laughter</nvs> I can drink.
