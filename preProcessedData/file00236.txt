 she started to walk.

.
?

 yes.
   everyday,    I have to do many works for her,  washing clothes  and   make her food.
. And so, many times  she is crying so   I have to ask her   what to do. 
Hobby?   I like swimming.
   when I was university student,
 I went to swimming pool
 but  
  after I got married,
 I have no time. 
. But my husband likes tennis very, very much.
  sometime  I go to play tennis with him.
.
And I don't . 
    I'm not good at  playing tennis. 
        ,  a woman is sitting on the chair  in front of her computer        and one cat is  on the bed and  one dog lie on the floor.    door left open. . 

.
Yes, sometime.
    the e-mail is  convenient,
  because  if the person  I'd like to contact is not available,
 I can contact the person
 and    I don't bother the person.
. But  telephone is the    more familiar

so    we can hear live voice

and contact the person. 

Yes.
  I'm planning the  trip to foreign country,
but   I can't decide where to go.
 So  do you have some idea? 
  I will go to with my mother

  warm ,   I'd like to go to   the not too   warm,  
   cool
place.

.
.
       I'd like to know some  package tour.
.
 in  mid August.
And  please tell me the cost of the tour.

Yes.
 thank .

 three times.
Spain.
   I like Spanish food,
 and    mood of lighting. 
 one day last week,  I went to restaurant
with my boss.
    we didn't made reservation
and  the waiter    attend to the table.
   and   my boss told me
    to choose  what I want.
     my boss  chose meat dish
and  I ate fish dish.
   we ate a lot of food and drank
a lot. 
Of course,
my boss paid.
   And      we said good-bye.
And we went home each other.

Sometime. 
Yes. 
    I like him very much, but he will  resign this month.
. And he will go to New York for his new job.
.   he can speak English very, very fluently. 

     he hear  what I'd like to say
and discuss.
 So discuss the many things
 about my job.
.
  I go back home.

I have to
  pick up my daughter
to the day-care center.
Yes.



Thank you very much.
