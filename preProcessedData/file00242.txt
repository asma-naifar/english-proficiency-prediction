I went to the    some .  and   I  dropped my   luggage  from the   platform  to the  ground of the rail. So  ?    Station clock?      no.   ?     I talked about that   someone    standing close. But  after that    train is     coming to  the stations.  after the train pass through   my luggage   ,   was safe.   with no damage. So the  station clerk   go down there   and they  take my luggage to pass me. ?
?
 no.    when I  come to our office directly from home  I use train.
But the case I went to  customer directly,
  I can use the company's car.

. . That's very  organized and the  very useful.
 but     fare  is very high, I think. Yeah. And the  most   important thing is the    huge number of the people's living in   this areas. So they are   especially in the  morning  rushing   times  station, I think.
