O K. this is a very nice neighborhood. And it is a very sunny day. And people come out, and play, or take a walk in the town. And now, there is a car parked in front of a house. And two women, one is walking the dog, are talking with each other. And children are playing in the yard. And a man is jogging. And I see another man sitting on a bench reading a newspaper.
Yes, I do.
 O K. My neighborhood is rather very old-fashioned place. People have lived there for a long time, for generations. So there are very old traditions and community ties, I mean, companionship between people. but it is a little hard to live there because I don't feel free from the community, or I I have to behave . Yes, but it's good to live such a place, too. .
O K. O K.
Hello, this is .
Hello. I'm afraid I have to say something. unfortunately, I can't go to your dinner party today.
 I'm very sorry. But my son, he caught a cold. And I thought he was O K, but now, I found that he has a high fever. So I think I had better stay home with him. And later I'll take him to the doctor. So I was looking forward to go to your party so I'm very disappointed.
.
 yes, I know. But this is inevitable. So next time, I will go to your party.
So I'm sorry.
 yes, yes. you know he takes train everyday to go to his school. And maybe he caught a cold on the train. because you know, very many people have flu nowadays. And yesterday, he said he felt a little strange. And I made him go to bed early last night. But this morning, his face was very red. And he has a high fever now. He can't eat. He only drinks water and tea. he sweats all over. So I think his condition is very bad.

I hope so.
