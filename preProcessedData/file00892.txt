And     they ordered   their favorite   foods and drinks.  ? The gentleman ate  fried chicken and drunk  a small glass of beer. Maybe     different drink.
    the after  the gentleman pays  the dinner   and they say   good-bye  to each other.
  for  dinner,  I usually go to some restaurant,
because  I don't have a time or I don't like cooking.
