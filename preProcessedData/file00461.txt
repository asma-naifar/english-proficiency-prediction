Even though the advertisement of the tour said that there are a lot of activities for free, and that's why we joined the tour, but in the fact, for some activities, you have to pay money.

Yeah.
Yes. ? Did you? Yes.
. He said it's optional. Yeah. " we didn't know that we have to offer these optional tour or activities for free.".
. so means you can't make any decisions about it?
. So, could you change to your adviser who are responsible for this kind of things?
. Could you tell him to call me back? My telephone number is one two three four five six. .
Yeah. And, what I wanted to say is since we spent another ten thousand dollars for the activities, we had thought it's already include for the fee of the tour. So we want you give me back the money about it.
