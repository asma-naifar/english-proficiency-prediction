Yes. . My name is .
Nice to meet you. 
.  Yes,  this morning,  I wake up  at seven, but  a little bit sleepy.
.   . I sit down my desk and  turn on my computer and check the E-mails. . And  I'm interested in   foreign exchange rate, so I check on the internet. 
So, now   I think  it is a time to exchange  dollars to Japanese yen. . So  I have to check the timing to exchange.
.
. Often  the important E-mail is from the  Netherlands headquarter. . So  I  read the message.   so, sometime I have to print out the document and send a fax massage to the customers,  or  I ask my boss  to  check the E-mails.
 
 so   one years ago,  my former boss  quit  suddenly.  and next boss   came here.
But   he didn't like his work, so he quit only one month. . So    I was worrying if  Japan branch  closed or not.
 . But,   soon,  new boss    came here. But          he worked here   four years ago.
 . So  he knew  the job  very well,  so    he has been working here  for one month.  but, this April,   real new boss  will come here.
 . No. . When   he received the interview,  I bring the coffee just.  And  I said him, "Nice to meet you.". 
. I think   he is very smart,  and  I hope he is kind. 
No.
 .  . Ladies and gentleman    have a dinner.     today is a   special day  because   one years ago,  they got married.  so the    
 clerk     brings the wine and  asked the gentleman  if the taste is good or not.  and the gentleman  liked the wine. So  he said, "This is O K.". . And  the restaurant is very good, so   they can hear the live   piano.  so    they enjoy the dinner  on special day.
 .  Order first? .   . Before  I  come to   the restaurant like this,    I usually  make reservation and ask the clerk   which course is better.  So  I think the    start dish is the  start menu. 
.  O K.
Yeah. . This is .
   . Now, are you O K? .
  . I'd like to go to  the movie  this weekend.
. . Shall we go   with the movie  "Totoro"?
. Before? . So,        what kind of movie   do you want to go now?
Action movies?
   do you have some idea?
 so    action movies. .  .
.    so   this is old movie. .  . 
         so  I'd like to check with you.
,   when are you available? I'll go  .
Tomorrow?
   . Sorry, I forget  where is your home? 
 so,  how can I get  
? . Now  I live in  Kita-. . So, how can I get to ?
.
 so,  tomorrow,   I will    go your home
  at two. . O K?

Thank you. .
  I like. But,  no chance to go to movies. Because my daughter is too young. . .
But, soon,  I can go to the theater     to look  "Totoro" .
.
 . Now, she loves  playing  blocks.
. Or watching  videos  for her.
.
Or animation. .
.
"One day last week"?
.
Yeah. .
One day last week,  I went to the department in Ikebukuro  because  my husband   's birthday is  next Wednesday. . So I   decided to give him  a new necktie.  So I asked the clerk  which is better  for him.  . I explained  about him. He is  and    slim.  So     I bought it. And,    when I went back home     I  looked at the   advertisement of    final sales.  shoes were thirty percent off.  dresses  were fifty  percent off, so     this was the unexpected shopping. But    I bought them.   I was happy, but    I cannot tell him about my shopping.
  . It was  a  handmade cake.
Valentine days.
Yes. But  almost of it,  my daughter    ate it. 
 . He ate  one piece, but  I know  he doesn't like sweets.
 but   he eat for me.
. 
  I don't know, but  his father  doesn't like sweets.
. 

 so my boss  cannot come to the office  this morning because of his headache.  I guess  he drank too much last night.
  I have to   receive the phones and check the E-mails for him.
.
Thank you.
.
