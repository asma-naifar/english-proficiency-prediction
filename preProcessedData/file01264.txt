One day last week, <F>ur</F> I and my friend <SC>was</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>we</R> <SC>went to camping</SC> <F>ur</F> went camping by my car. And <F>ur</F> <R>we</R> we went by the river and set up the tent for tonight. And we cooked dinner. <F>Well</F> when the dinner was ready, suddenly <SC>the rain</SC> <F>urr</F> it started to rain. Then <F>mm</F> the wind blew really hard that we couldn't keep camping there. So we <SC>got on the</SC> <F>ur</F> get into the car. And we found a nice hotel. So we decided to stay at the hotel. And three hours later, the rain stopped. But we didn't feel like going back to the camping place so we decided to stay <SC>at ho</SC> at the hotel for the rest of the day.That's <?>it</?>.<F>Well</F> it's <F>mm</F> up to <F>mm</F> which place we are <laughter>interested in</laughter>. But like we sometimes go <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to see <F>ur</F> temples and shrines since my husband likes old historical buildings. Then we sometimes go to Kamakura or <SC>we</SC> <F>well</F> we went to Kyoto last year.But basically he always asked me where I want to go. So I guess I <laughter>usually decide</laughter>where to go.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter>Yes</laughter>.<F>Well</F> last trip we went to. <F>Well</F> let's see, we went to Kyoto last <SC>Dec</SC> <F>ur</F> no, November.And <F>ur</F> one of my cousin got married in Kobe. We went to wedding party in Kobe <R>on</R> on Friday. Then we had a nice wedding party in Kobe. After that, we went to Kyoto and stayed there <SC>for two</SC> no, for three days.<F>Ur</F> <R>we</R> we looked around Kyoto City. It was nice trip, but it was really nice day so there were so many people <laughter>there</laughter>. <F>Ur</F> we sometimes couldn't see <F>ur</F> really important <F>ur</F> treasures because there were so many people.Train. <F>Well</F> I guess <F>ur</F> for me, I don't really drive <laughter>so</laughter> it's really <F>ur</F> comfortable and <F>ur</F> <R>feel</R> <F>ur</F> feel much <F>er</F> better than the train because I don't have to stand up all the way to that area. And in a train, we don't really talk a lot.<F>Well</F> my husband sometimes sleeps <OL><laughter>or</laughter></OL>read books all the time. But in a car, <F>ur</F> since my husband is driving, we can talk a lot so that's one of the advantage, I guess.<F>Mm</F>.O K.Yeah.<F>Well</F><F>ur</F> <?>this</?> Sunday, I'm going to Shiodome,Shio Site something with my husband. <F>Ur</F> I heard there is one shop for <SC><JP>shouchu</JP></SC> Japanese <JP>shouchu</JP>.
