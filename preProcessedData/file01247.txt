And I want to <SC>put it</SC> stick into my pocket,so I can listen to it even on the crowded train. So I was looking for a really small one. And these days, technology is really <F>ur</F> great.So luckily I could find <F>ur</F> a radio <R>which</R> <R>which is a</R> which is actually bit smaller than a cigar box.It's kind of small.Yes. So I'm quite happy with the product.One day last week. <OL>O K</OL>.O K. This is afirst line.I see.All right. <F>Urm</F> one day last week, <F>ur</F> a man <F>ur</F> went to <F>ur</F> the train station as usual. It's eight o'clock in the morning. And the platform <F>ur</F> <R>was</R> <F>ur</F> was crowded. <R>There</R> there're a lot of people waiting for the train. And the man <F>ur</F> accidentally dropped off <R>his</R> <F>ur</F> <SC>his <F>ur</F> lug</SC> his briefcase <F>urm</F> <R>to</R> <F>urm</F> to the <F>ur</F> <R>rail</R> railway because the man <F>ur</F> standing next to him <F>ur</F> accidentally elbowed him without looking at him. So the man who dropped <F>ur</F> the briefcase complained to him. But <F>ur</F> while he was talking to the man, the train came and it <?>ran</?> over <F>ur</F> his briefcase. And the man was <F>ur</F> <F>uh</F> panicked <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> worrying that his <F>ur</F> briefcase <SC>were</SC> was damaged. But luckily <F>ur</F> his briefcase was safe. And <SC>their train guards</SC> <R>fi</R> finally <SC>the train guards <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> went down on to the <F>ur</F> <SC>rail train</SC> <laughter>rail</laughter></SC>, <R>what</R> <R>what</R> what do I wanna say? <F>Er</F> <F>ur</F> the train guards <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> picked up his <F>er</F> briefcase and got it back to him.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> This was kind of redundant.Yes, <OL>I do</OL>.<OL>Yes</OL>.Yes.<F>Ur</F> let's see. <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> <SC>I usually</SC> <F>ur</F> since I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>,<OL><SC>I take</OL> <F>ur</F> three lines</SC> I can take three lines.One is <F>ur</F> the <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Line which I use <F>ur</F> to go to work. And <SC>the other one</SC> <F>uh</F> the other ones are <F>ur</F> the <H pn="others7">XXX09</H> Line and the local <F>ur</F> line called <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>.And <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Line, <F>urm</F> <R>I</R> I think <F>ur</F> it's been used by a lot of <F>ur</F> commuterswho go to work. And it's pretty <F>ur</F> crowded<OL><F>ur</F></OL> during the rush hour. But I can avoid rush hour since I work <F>ur</F> from noon.<laughter>So</laughter> it doesn't bother me. And I don't know. How <??></??>. <F>Mm</F>. <F>Well</F> <SC>it's</SC> <F>well</F> if I compare it <R>to</R> <F>ur</F> to <H pn="others8">XXX10</H> Line, <F>ur</F> it's quite different from <H pn="others5">XXX07</H> Line. It has a lot of <F>er</F> tourists<?>on as</?> usually.And I used to commute by <H pn="others8">XXX10</H>.And in summer, it's such a pain because you see a lot of <F>ur</F> tourists and, you know, they are going to the beach. They're wearing beach sandals and so on. <F>Uh</F> <SC>the</SC> I was the only person wearing suitsand having a newspaper.But anyway, I think <R>that's</R> that's the difference <OL>between</OL> the two lines.Almost.<F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> I haven't decided <OL>anything</OL>,but <F>ur</F> <F>well</F> I'm here with <SC>my co-worker</SC> my friend, <H pn="others9">XXX11</H>.<OL>So maybe</OL> we will have some coffee.So after that, <F>urm</F> I'll just <F>ur</F> go home and <F>ur</F> read the book I'm reading.<F>Oh</F> yes.<OL>It's my</OL> day off.Thank you very much.<OL>I</OL> really enjoyed it.<OL>O K</OL>.
