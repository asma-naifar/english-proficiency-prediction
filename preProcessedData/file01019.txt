of the Japan. So there are lot of place to ride the bicycle.

 around the river.
 there are lot of people or lot of car

to ride the bicycle.

.
. One day last week. . O K. . O K. . One day, the the couple were walking to go to their home. And it was rain and so they have umbrella. . And when they approached the electric pole, the man noticed the something to cry near here. And next, the women noticed the box next to the electrical pole. And she found very small cat. and she wanted to bring the cat and maybe she hope to take care of the cat. But the man refused to her proposal. But next, she hoped to bring back the cat more and and she asked him to bring him to their home again. And a finally, he agreed to her opinion. And they came to their home with the small cat and box.
Yes. .
.
 yes. .
 I love a cat or good dogs but I have never take care of them. But my neighborhood have some dogs and sometimes I take care of them.
So I think the having cat is is an advance to the emotion about the important of the life. . And so I think the children's education is very good to take care of them.
.
