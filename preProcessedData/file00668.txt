. Yeah. . Because my school work is very busy, I try to  have a hobby outside. One  of them is flower arrangement.     I have learned flower arrangement since I was under graduate. And I had learned it  for maybe five years. . So  when I do flower arrangement, my feeling comes to be kind of happy. 
Attraction?
.  Basically I like flower. So     to remember flower's name, or kind of how to decorate flower   is kind of attract  to me. . . .
Yeah. In ,  I grow flower.
And everyone was very surprised because   before I came to ,   no one grow flowers in . So ".", every one was very surprised. But it's my hobby. .

 .  I like bed.  But   because of the room size, my room is very small.  So    I have to make  a  for sleeping. And when I wake up, I have to remove the . But      one thing.  . The advantage of  is    you know, even though I wake up in the morning, I'm sleepy.
 when I remove , it's kind of physical movement. So I wake up immediately, ". I have to go to school.".

 O K. One day last week, Ken  and Aiko   walked through the road. And  they hear  some kind of  animals voice. ". What this voice?" he said. And   his girl friend found a  baby cat. .  she wanted to take the cat to her home. But her boy friend denied ". You don't. You don't.". Then   she tries to  request him that " I really want to take this cat to my home. Please.".  So then  he was worried about that. But finally, they decided that they take the cat to  their home. And the cat might be happy . 

Yeah.
Yeah.
 I think     especially my dog,   my dog makes me happy.   it's because maybe he doesn't say nothing. 
But  just  play with him  is very fun and interesting. And also    I forget my busy life when I play with him.  and also  I think  after he came to my  house,   kind of my family's    corporation become to be very tight. 
. Because of his   help. . So I'm very happy to welcome him to my home.

Dog is it?
. 
. Yeah, Mixed. .
Big.  Big. So when he is child, he's very small kind of, 
but  immediately, he become bigger, bigger, bigger.
And now, very big,
heavy.
And very active.  He's crazy.
Crazy.  Always crazy.   But very pretty. 
Yeah. . Yeah. Because  I don't have chance to go back to   my home town. So  I really miss him.
.
You're welcome.
