One day last week, she went to shopping and she went to department store. She want to buy something for her husband to his birthday. So  she decided to buy necktie. And she asked the clerk to wrap the present. After buying present,   she walked in department store and found final sale of lady's shoes and  lady's clothes.  shoes was   thirty percent off and clothes  were fifty percent off. So she bought  many shoes and clothes at departmrnt store. And   she brought many bags to her house.
