Good evening.
Yes. My name is .
Yes. Please call me .
Around this time? Usually, I work,
 at my office.
. I'm running some companies.
 companies.
Yes. Several companies.
Yes. That's right.
. One time. That's very difficult because many division are different system, and the different way, and different person, and everything are different. I mean, for example, my company has just logistic company. And also transportation company. and ceremony center, swimming school. That's so complete different. So, sometimes very difficult, but I enjoy work very much.
. I see. . only some of people are little different to treat me or another man. like even I'm a top, even though, first guest, like before maybe we met each other, but that person usually never forget to me because I'm a woman.
Yeah, but sometimes, first time, guest, " I'd like to meet your boss.". That's, like a secretary "I am", I said, and "What?". 
So little different, like compare to Japan and United States, I think. But recently, not so bad.
Yeah.
. Not, not at all.
. Since last year, I move to the swimming pool. And mainly, I stay in swimming pool's office.
. . One of my hobbies are work. And another, of course, I like dancing, go to shopping, and maybe things like go to see opera or ballet. . But usually, I enjoyed work very much, so no problem.
Work is the best for me, one of my hobbies.
. Usually, four hours.
I don't think so. But I don't have enough time. So no choice.
Even in the dream, sometimes work, here. 
.
O K. I think this is a school, and the teacher teaching the students for mathematics. And most of people are not interested in that math lesson. So one of men, I don't know how to say in English, but the man is drinking a bottle of juice. And another lady is playing caluculator, I think. And two of students are chatting each other. Only one person who has yellow hair he just a maybe he is trying to concentrate. . But I think he can't. And I don't know how to say in, to make up gum? . Yeah. But is no teacher is continuing to teach math to use black board.
Yes.
. High school student. . When I was a high school student, teacher was so strict. And nobody like that action. . I think recently, in many schools' teacher and also student are also the student are not concentrate to study because most of people has a cellular phone, and always on and usually talking with cellular phone. That's why the teacher also can't concentrate to teach to them. So I can't believe that situation.
O K.
.
O K.
Ring-ring. Hi.
Hi, hello, .
. .
?
 I'm sorry. Didn't I call you before?
. I'm so sorry. . I'm totally misunderstood. . Dinner party is tomorrow night.
I'm so sorry. . And today, I was very busy until now. Now, I've just arrived home.
. I'd like to, but now already ten o'clock. And usually I can't sleep a lot, maybe if you don't mind, I'd like to go to bed early tonight. Is it possible?
 Sounds very nice I really like to you, but could you raincheck?
 that's. . But I think I can't come tonight. And, also I have a little stomachache. . So please . I don't know what to say.
Thank you so much.
Of course, certainly.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for calling. Bye.

. Difficult.
. At my house?
. Yes. . But I can't drink any alcohol beverages. So sometimes, a little difficult to refuse the alcohol. Most of people can drink. And I try to drunk only a little. But I pass out. So after that, the doctor said you have a really bad allergy, so you can't drink.
. first of all, I say "I'm sorry I have allergy for alcoholic beverages. . So can I have oolong tea?". And after that, many people, "No, no, no, only a little.". So I said "I'm so sorry, I'd like to, but after that, can you responsible to me?". Most of the people said, " O K, O K.".
.
One day last week, this is me?
. O K. . I and my boyfriend were walking on the street. And I noticed the miaow miaow from the box. And I told my boyfriend, and he is "No, I can't hear" and "No way, can you hear that?". ". Yeah, yeah, yes.". . But I said " can I bring him to the house?". And he said ". It's a little difficult.". "But now today, it's raining, so can you leave this cat in here?". . ". That's very difficult, but O K, O K.". " if you don't, I don't want to move here, so you can leave now," I said. And he is really upset, and confused. . Finally he said "O K. . we can raise him at our house.". " that's very kind. O K. Shall we go back?". And we were holding the cat.
In the rain.
Very much. I have a two cats, two dogs.
Yes.
And I have a cellular phone.
And that's title my cats' pictures, photograph, many photographer.
. Sometimes, when I arrive home, nobody there, but cat or dogs are barking and miaow miaow, and feels so friendly. And when I have strong stress, they cured acting, it makes me very happy.
So cute.
. I think so.
Yeah. Actually, one of cat, about four days ago, he I couldn't concentrate to work. And when I'm really really busy, not so bad. But after that, when I see other cat or dog, I miss him so much. crazy that is Pyonkichi and I called Phyonkichi, Phonkichi, Phonkichi, like crazy.
O K.

Not have to, but I'd like to.
Because tomorrow, so many guests. So I have to prepare for everything.
And fourteenth in this month, we have a general meeting. . So, I have prepare for that document. That's why I would like to go back to the office tonight.
