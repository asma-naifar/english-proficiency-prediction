Good evening.Yes. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Yes. Please call me <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Around this time? Usually, I work,<R>at</R> <R>at my</R> at my <F>err</F> office.<F>Urrr</F>. <SC>I am</SC> <F>ur</F> I'm running some companies.<OL>I am</OL> <laughter>companies</laughter> companies.Yes. Several companies.Yes. That's right.<F>Urrr</F>. One time. That's very difficult because many division <F>ur</F> are different <F>urr</F> system, and the different way, and different person, and everything are different. <F>Urr</F> I mean, for example, <F>mm</F> my company has <F>urr</F> just logistic company. And <F>urr</F> also transportation company. <R>And</R> and <F>urr</F> ceremony center, <R>swimming</R> swimming school. That's <F>urr</F> so complete different. So, sometimes very difficult, but I enjoy work very much.<F>Urrr</F>. I see. <F>Urr</F>. <SC>some of</SC> only some of people are little different to treat me or <SC>man</SC> another man. <F>Err</F> like <F>urr</F> even I'm a top, even though, <F>urr</F> <SC>first of all</SC> first guest, like <F>ur</F> <.></.> <F>mm</F> before maybe we met each other, but that person usually never forget to me because I'm a woman.Yeah, but <F>urr</F> <F>mmm</F> sometimes, <F>urr</F> first time, <F>ur</F> guest, <F>urr</F> "<F>Oh</F> I'd like to meet your boss.". That's, <laughter>I'm <F>ur</F> like a secretary</laughter>, you know. Yeah, and <F>uh</F> "I am", I said, and "What?". <nvs>laughter</nvs>So little different, like <F>urr</F> compare to Japan and United States, I think. But recently, not so bad.Yeah.<OL>Not at all</OL>. Not, not at all.<F>Urrr</F>. Since last year, <F>mm</F> <SC>I became</SC> <F>ur</F> <SC>no, no</SC> I move to the swimming pool. And mainly, I stay in swimming pool's office.<F>Uh</F>. <F>Mm</F>. One of my hobbies are work. And another, <nvs>laughter</nvs> of course, <F>urr</F> I like dancing, <SC>go</SC> <SC>going</SC> <F>um</F> go to <R>shop</R> shopping, and <F>urr</F> maybe things like <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> go to see opera or ballet. <F>Err</F>. But usually, I enjoyed work very much, so no problem.Work is the best <nvs>laughter</nvs> for me, <SC>my</SC> one of my hobbies.<F>Urr</F>. Usually, <R>four</R> <R>four</R> four hours.I don't think so. But I don't have enough time. So no choice.Even in the dream, <F>urr</F> sometimes <R>work</R> <R>work</R> work, here. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Mm-hmm</F>.O K. <F>Urr</F> I think <F>urr</F> this is a school, and <F>urr</F> the teacher <F>urr</F> teaching the students <F>mm</F> for <F>uh</F> mathematics. And most of people are not interested in that <R>math</R> math lesson. So <F>urr</F> one of men, <.></.> <F>urr</F> I don't know how to say in English, but <F>urr</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>ur</F> the man is drinking <F>urr</F> <SC>juice</SC> a bottle of juice. And <F>ur</F> another lady <F>err</F> is <F>ur</F> playing <F>ur</F> <R>calu</R> caluculator, I think. And <F>ur</F> two of students are chatting each other. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Only one person <R>who</R> who has yellow hair <F>mm</F> he just a <F>urr</F> maybe <R>he is</R> he is trying to concentrate. <F>Err</F>. But I think he can't. And I don't know how to say in, to make up <F>urr</F> <R>buble</R> <SC>bubble gum</SC> <JP>kana</JP> gum? <F>Mm</F>. Yeah. But <F>urr</F> <SC>teacher <F>ur</F> is <SC>s</SC> no</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> teacher is continuing to teach math <F>ur</F> to use <F>ur</F> black board.Yes.<F>Uh</F>. High school student. <F>Urr</F>. When <SC>I am</SC> <F>urr</F> <R>I was</R> I was a high school student, <F>urm</F> teacher <SC>is</SC> was so strict. And nobody <F>err</F> like that action. <F>Mm</F>. I think recently, in many schools' teacher and also student are <.></.> not so good because the teacher also doesn't want to study so much, just same teaching. And <F>urr</F> also the student <R>are</R> are not concentrate to study <F>err</F> because most of people has a cellular phone, and <SC>on</SC> always <F>urr</F> on and <F>urr</F> usually <F>err</F> talking <F>mm</F> with <F>urr</F> cellular phone. That's why the teacher also can't <F>er</F> concentrate to teach to them. So I can't believe that situation.O K.<F>Ohh</F>.O K.Ring-ring. Hi.Hi, hello, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>.<F>Oh</F>. <F>Oh</F>.<F>Mm</F>?<F>Ohh</F> I'm sorry. Didn't I call you before?<F>Ohh</F>. I'm so sorry. <F>Urm</F>. I'm totally misunderstood. <F>Urr</F>.

But <F>urr</F> <F>mm</F> I can't drink any alcohol beverages. So sometimes, <F>urr</F> a little difficult to refuse the alcohol. Most of people can drink. And <F>urr</F> <F>mm</F> I try to <F>mm</F> drunk only a little. But <F>uh</F> I pass out. So after that, <F>urr</F> the doctor said you have a really bad allergy, <F>er</F> so you can't drink.<F>Urr</F>. <SC>I say before</SC> first of all, I say "I'm sorry I have allergy for alcoholic beverages. <F>Urr</F>. So <F>urr</F> can I have <F>urr</F> oolong tea?". And after that, <F>err</F> many people, "No, no, no, only a little.". So I said "I'm so sorry, I'd like to, but after that, <F>urr</F> can you responsible to me?". <nvs>laughter</nvs> Most of the people said, "<F>Ohh</F> O K, O K.".<F>Ohh</F>.One day last week, <F>urr</F> this is me?<F>Oh</F>.

"But now today, it's raining, so <R>can you</R> <F>mm</F> can you leave this cat in here?". <F>Urr</F>. "<F>Mm</F>. That's very difficult, but <F>urr</F> O K, O K.".

Finally he said "O K. <F>Err</F>. <R>We can</R> we can raise him <R>at</R> at our house.". "<F>Wow</F> that's very kind. O K. Shall we go back?". And we were holding the cat.In the rain.Very much.
