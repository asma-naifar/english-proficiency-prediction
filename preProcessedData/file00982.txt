   one day last week,     Ken drove his car to go to his office.
 and the guy on the bike using mobile phone  even  using mobile phone while driving is  very danger.
And then,     he was very busy to talk with   his girlfriend. So he didn't notice the Ken's car is coming. And then, hit his car.  And dropped his mobile phone.
 Even it's his fault, he is complaining to Ken. Because     his bike and mobile phone was broken  by hitting Ken's car. Then Ken said, "O K. Let's call policeman. Because I don't think it's my fault.". And policeman came and Ken is explaining what happening.   he is explaining, "Because this guy is talking by mobile phone while driving, so it's not his fault. His fault.". Then, O K.   policeman agreed Ken's opinion.     this bike, actually, damage was not so bad.
But  it should be  repaired.
So the  bike was taken to the place,
to repair.

Yes.
I have a car license.
.
No. Never. Because .
.
No need to drive in Tokyo.
 it's very convenient to use as a I D.
Because  .
Sometimes it's very bad.
 very    around the big city like  Shibuya, very difficult find a place to park.
And the traffic is very busy.
 I usually use bus to come to the office,
But  sometimes bus cannot move because of the traffic.
Usually in the morning, it take just twenty minutes to come to the office but in the evening, because of people and then traffic  it took about forty minutes.
Terrible. Yeah.
