Why?
Where. . Yeah.   I usually go to Ginza  and Shinjuku  mainly  department store.     but,  every season,      the shops are  different place because    I like to  change     my impression. And,   yes,     I want to     enjoy shopping. And   I like to  select  that season  color        to coordinate.
Yes.
Yes.   one day last week,   this couple    found   the sounds of       something cry in the box.    it was  rainy day.  And      they  look in the box.  And there is a    tiny cat in the  box, and   this woman      likes cat.   and    she asked him to   bring        their home.  But he  said no.  But            suggest him that     she take care   they try to take   care of it    until              somebody can   take  care  of it.     and then,     he   gave up         her    strong request, and  they   brought it to  their house.
 yes,   I went to    Kagurazaka  with  my  colleagues, and      our chairman   to eat    ,  because   we  about six persons  with    chairman   is member of      .  .       we sometimes  go to   eat    and  talk about          many things.
So, maybe,  this time is last time because  my chairman    will retire
this February.
     we will give  a present for him  .
.
 Thank you .
