Because <F>um</F> <SC>I</SC> it is <F>mm</F> difficult for me to study English <F>mm</F> because <R>I'm</R> I'm aged. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So I think <F>mm</F> <R>earlier sta</R> <F>uh</F> earlier <F>uh</F> start, <F>uh</F> the better English. <nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Er</F>.

And <R>he is</R> <F>uh</F> <SC>he is</SC> <F>er</F> she spends her time with computer, such as <F>um</F> Internet or E-mail. And her pets are also <F>uh</F> <SC>in the</SC> in her room.
