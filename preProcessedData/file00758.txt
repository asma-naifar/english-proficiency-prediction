. There are one girl and one dog, one cat in the room. .     she is showing  to cat the computer. And she is good at using computer, and   the cat is on the bed, and   it is sleeping. .  Bed is   comfortable,  and       she loves    to listening to the  music because  there are C D player in the room.  And    she can use typewriter.  . Typewriter is next to the computer.   The dog is on the floor,   which is sleeping, too.
