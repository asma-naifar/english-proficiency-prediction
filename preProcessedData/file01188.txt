Good morning.<F>Ah</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Fine.O K.Good.<OL>It's</OL> very hot.<F>Ah</F> no. <F>Ahm</F> my office is at the corner of the <F>ah</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Yeah.O K. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Well</F> I originally belong to the aerospace group at <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H>. But <F>erm</F> as right now, I am working for a company <H pn="company name2">XXX05</H>. And I belong to the first section of that <F>ah</F> company. And I'm handling <F>ah</F> program called <H pn="others2">XXX06</H>,<OL>which is</OL> the <F>ah</F> radar of the <H pn="others3">XXX07</H>. And I import that radar and <F>er</F> deliver it to the <F>ah</F> <H pn="others4">XXX08</H> which is <F>uh</F> <H pn="others5">XXX09</H>.<OL><F>Oh</F></OL> this is my forth year <SC>in the</SC> in this company <OL>and <F>ah</F></OL>my <F>ah</F> previous <F>ah</F> days here at <H pn="company name1">XXX04</H> was <F>ah</F> basically handling the year budget for the section, so <F>er</F> I didn't <F>ah</F> go out <F>ah</F> <F>aaa</F> much, you know, <F>ah</F> meeting <F>ah</F> <SC>the com</SC> <F>ah</F> the customers.<OL>But <F>ah</F></OL> right now, <F>ah</F> I'm pretty much out <F>er</F> going outside, <F>ah</F> contacting our customers.Yeah.Yes, I do.Entertain. <F>Erm</F>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Oh</F> we do a lot of things. But <F>ah</F> basically, we go out and <F>er</F> have a dinner. And <F>ah</F> some alcohol will <F>ah</F>help us a lot.Difficulties.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL> no. <F>Ah</F> basically <R>I</R> I usually have fun entertaining them. <F>Ah</F> having <F>ah</F> some good food, <F>ah</F> couple of drinks.<F>Ah</F> you <F>hm</F> see a different side of the customer, having dinner and having drinks with them because <F>er</F> <R>in a</R> in a conference room, it's like <R>ver</R> very <F>ah</F> strict and <F>ah</F> you know, everyone's very serious.<OL>But <F>ah</F></OL> if you go out and have dinner, couple of drinks, <F>er</F> things loosen up and you can see the <F>er</F> <?>wait</?> <SC?>by</SC?> the private side of customer's face. And <F>ah</F> yeah, <SC?>it can get quite</SC?> I enjoy it.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<F>Well</F> I go to the States <F>ah</F> maybe once every three to four month but I see Americans do that kind of <F>ah</F> entertainment.<OL>Going out</OL> for dinner, <OL>couple of drinks</OL>.So I don't really say that very Japanese style but <F>ah</F> I think it's <R>very</R> very common <R>in</R> <SC>in</SC> <F>ah</F> worldwide.Yeah.<F>Mhm-huh</F>.No.<F>Ah</F> it's too hot.<OL><F>Ahm</F></OL> <F>ah</F> the humidity in Japan is <F>ah</F> too high. <F>Ah</F> it's very uncomfortable. <F>Ah</F> and I don't do any, what do you call it, those <F>ah</F> sports in summer.<OL>I don't swim</OL>. I don't go to the <F>ah</F> ocean. I don't <F>ah</F> do anything. I just kind of <SC>s</SC> try to stay <R>in</R> <F>ah</F> you know, <F>ah</F> in a cooler place. But I like winter better because <F>ah</F> I've been playing ice hockey for about <F>ah</F> twenty-two years now. <R>And</R> and comparing summer with winter, <F>ah</F> <SC>I get</SC> I can definitely say that I like winter <OL>much, much</OL> more.<.></.> <F>Well</F> it's <F>ah</F> the classroom. A woman standing here <SC>is</SC> I think, is a teacher <F>ah</F> teaching, I think, this is math. <F>Ah</F> there are six students <F>ah</F> in this picture. <F>Oh</F> actually I think there're seven. <F>Oh</F> one student <SC>can</SC> I can identify a hand. <F>Ah</F> to include that, it would be seven students. <F>Ah</F> to start from the front row to the left, <F>ah</F> a student is <F>ahm</F> just sitting, looking outside, chewing gum, <F>er</F> making a bubble. <F>Ahm</F> the one in the middle seen in the front, <F>ah</F> he is concentrating on the blackboard. <SC>He is</SC> <SC>I think <F>ah</F> very</SC> <F>ah</F> I think he is listening to the teacher. And <SC>he is</SC> I think he is learning. The one on the right side, a girl <F>ah</F> is, <F>ah</F> this is not a calculator, I think this is <F>ah</F> what is this, maybe a cell phone. <F>Ah</F> she might be calculating by using her <R>ce</R> cellular phone or she might be checking her e-mail, but <F>ah</F> I'm not <?>really</?> sure. But I think <F>ah</F> she is not <SC>conce</SC> <SC>ce</SC> concentrating. In the second row, <F>ah</F> in the middle, a student is listening to his, I think, a Walkman. He has an <SC>earphone</SC> <SC>hea</SC> earphone or a headset on. He is drinking a juice, I think. <SC>Might</SC> <F>well</F> it looks like a tea. And <F>ah</F> he is closing <SC>eye</SC> his eyes. <F>Ah</F> he is not listening to the teacher. <SC>The woman sitting</SC> the girl sitting <R>left</R> <SC>left</SC> <F>ah</F> far left side in second row, she is talking to a friend who 's sitting behind her, having good time. She has a mirror on the desk. <F>Ah</F> she maybe just <F>ah</F> polish her nails. And the girl sitting right behind her is <F>ah</F> just talking to her and just having a good time.<OL>Yeah, that's about it</OL>.<Why do I think they are not listening? I don't know. I think <.></.> maybe because they don't have any interest in math. Maybe <R>the</R> <F>ah</F> the lecture is boring, <F>ah</F> it's so by the book maybe. <F>Ahm</F> maybe <F>ah</F> I don't know. <SC>It's</SC> I would way this is high school, so <F>ah</F> <F>um</F> I don't think <R>ma</R> many high school students <F>er</F> enjoy math, so <F>ah</F> I don't know. Maybe just lack of interest.What would I do? <F>Ahm</F> I would ask more questions to the students to <F>ah</F> get them involved <R>in the</R> in the classroom. <F>Ah</F> <F>ahm</F> yeah. To draw attention, I would <F>ah</F> solve some <F>ah</F> difficult questions to them, <F>ah</F> make them think. <F>Ah</F> maybe try <SC>to</SC> you know, a pop quiz or something. <F>Ah</F> <SC>write <SC>some</SC> <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> what do you say, <F>ah</F> maybe some questions</SC> write some questions on the blackboard, have the students come up, <F>er</F> solve the problem. <SC>I think you just</SC> basically just get them involved.O K.Yes. <F>Ahm</F> <nvs>sigh</nvs> I recently came here and <F>ah</F> <.></.> <SC>I bought this</SC> <F>ss</F> <SC>I am</SC> <F>ahm</F> I bought this book. And it wasn't actually what I <F>ah</F> had in mind, and <F>ah</F> I would like to <F>ah</F> turn it back, maybe <F>ah</F> get refund of it. <F>Ah</F> is that possible?<F>Ah</F> <R>a policy</R> a policy <R>of your</R> of your company?I see. <F>Ahm</F>. Would it be possible to give maybe like a fifty-percent refund?Is that a policy? It that written down <OL>in a policy</OL>?It's a written down policy.O K. <F>Ahm</F>. <F>Well</F> <F>ahhh</F> <.></.> <SC?>try</SC?> allow to say this, <F>ah</F> but <F>ah</F> <SC>I would really not think</SC> I would really think that that policy is not a very good one because <F>ah</F> many people do <R>make</R> <F>ah</F> make mistakes <F>ah</F> purchasing items. <F>Ah</F> when wondering a shop, they may <F>ah</F> assume that this <F>er</F> item is what they think they are, but when they <R>bring</R> bring it home and <F>ah</F> look through it, <F>ah</F> sometimes people find out that <F>ah</F> <SC>these items aren't as much</SC> <F>ah</F> <R>the qu</R> the quality of that item is not what they had in mind. And <F>ah</F> when they make those mistakes, <F>ah</F> <SC>they</SC> I think people should have an option <OL>to make a refund</OL>.O K. <F>Well</F>. <OL><CO>Actually</CO></OL>.Yeah.<OL>O K</OL>. All right. <F>Ahm</F> <F>well</F> instead of a refund, I found this <F>ah</F> <R>the</R> the book that I really did have in mind. And the price is about the same. <F>Ah</F> would it be possible to exchange it?So may I talk to your manager?He's in a meeting. <F>Ah</F> can I get an appointment with him?You don't know.O K. Then, <R>I'll</R> I'll <F>er</F> give you my <F>ah</F> cell phone number. If you <F>er</F> get touch with him, could you please <SC>c</SC> <F>ah</F> let me know.O K. <F>Ah</F> thank you.No.I didn't.<R>When I go shopping</R> <F>well</F> <SC>when I go shopping <SC>I really</SC> <SC>I just</SC> <R>I</R> <SC>I don't</SC> I</SC> <F>ah</F> when I go shopping, <R>I don't <F>ah</F> windowshop</R> I don't windowshop.<OL>I don't</OL> browse around. <F>Ahm</F> <SC>I have</SC> <SC>like I go throgh magazines, I see something</SC> <F>ah</F> <nvs>tsk</nvs> I go to a <R>s</R> store, I try to find that item. If I find it, I'd buy it.And I don't compare with things, and I just <F>ah</F> know what I want. And basically <F>ah</F> I have no problem with that in the past.<OL><nvs>cough</nvs></OL><F>Ah</F> this is me? <CO>The</CO>.<OL>O K</OL>.<.></.> <F>Well</F>. <R>Looking</R> looking at this picture, <F>ahm</F> if I start from number one, a guy is walking to a <SC>s</SC> train station. <SC>It's <F>ah</F> eight in the</SC> I think it is eight in the morning, so rush hours. All right. Number two. He gets to the platform. He drops his <F>ah</F> bag and <F>ah</F> the hand carry lands on the <F>er</F> rail taking the whole track. <F>Ah</F> in number three, he is <F>ah</F> talking to the guy next door. <F>Oh</F> number two, he bumped into a gentleman on a platform talking to his, I think maybe, a colleague or something. And I think he is blaming on that guy that his <F>ah</F> elbow hit him, and that is why <SC>they</SC> his <F>ah</F> bag fell down <R>to the</R> to the <F>ah</F> rail. <F>Ah</F> number four. The train comes. <SC>And the</SC> <F>oh</F> <F>well</F> it goes over the bag. But fortunately, since the bag is between the rail, <F>eh</F> <F>ah</F> the bag didn't get smashed. <F>Ah</F> <F>eh</F> and in number five, <SC>they</SC> the guy who dropped the bag was relieved. And number six, <R>the</R> <F>ah</F> <SC>the</SC> <F>ah</F> I think is this is an officer or maybe a employee of the <R>train</R> <F>ah</F> train company comes and <F>ah</F> <SC>gives</SC> picks up the the bag for this gentleman and gives it to him from below.How could he have avoided? Maybe just being more careful not to <F>ah</F> bump into someone or hold onto his bag more firmly.I do.<F>Oh</F> just <nvs>sigh</nvs> too many people on the train, <F>ah</F> get smashed every morning and <F>ah</F> it's even hard to breathe. Maybe it's very hot outside and <SC>the</SC> <F>ah</F> sometimes air condition is not very <F>ahhh</F> good enough and <F>ah</F> it's too hot. <F>Ah</F> everyone is sweating. Yeah. The worst case is when you have a very <F>ah</F> sweating guy standing next to you and <F>ah</F> his <F>ah</F> body temperature is very hot and <F>er</F> it's very uncomfortable.<OL>Yeah</OL>.<OL><SC>I don't do a</SC></OL> I don't do anything. I just <F>ah</F> bear it. And it takes about thirty minutes <R>t</R> <F>ah</F> to get to my <F>ah</F> destination. So I just bear it and <F>ah</F> keep eyes closed and just wait for thirty minutes go by.<nvs>sniff</nvs> <F>Ahm</F> <SC>I like to have the</SC> <F>ah</F> <SC>I like to</SC> I'll probably increase more trains so that the <F>ah</F> crowdness would decrease.Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.<F>Oh</F> this is Friday. <F>Ah</F> this weekend, actually, <F>ah</F> I'll have to go to the office. <F>Ah</F> I'm going to the States for this training thing about two weeks. And I have to <F>ah</F> prepare this document for a meeting which is held <F>ah</F> <F>ah</F> next week. <CO>So</CO>.<OL>Yeah</OL>.I'm going to Los Angeles.<F>Ah</F> but I've heard <R>it's</R> <F>ah</F> it's hot over there also. <CO>So</CO>.Yeah.Thank you.
