Yeah. But it's difficult for me to find a person to read a in the park. 
They have no time. 
They prefer to staying at home, or I don't know. 
 I think in , the neighborhood, they are closer than the Japanese.
. they speak a lot if they meet each other, and also say, "Hello, hello.". Yes, for example, " what are you doing today?". " what did you do yesterday?". Or they just talk very much. But in Japan, I think the neighbor, they choose some people to be the friends maybe to talk to each other. But they don't talk to everybody around them. Yes. . So just a , yes.
 . But a little bit maybe stranger is not good, but I can found such now. Yeah, this , they have many garbage just out of their house, you know. Really, but this is their area. So nobody can you say, " you can not.". But what they are doing, I can not understand. Because in my mind, Japanese is the very very clear. They like clean the house very very beautifully. Yes. maybe it's an exception.

. One day last .

One day last week, my friends, Jack and Bill came to my house, and we talked about something to do. And we just opened a magazine. And Jack found, " there is a very exciting film now on Yokohama. So should we go there?". So I said, ", O K, it's a good idea.". And Bill also agreed. So we immediately went out had some beverages. " the film was very exciting. And big planes and just a Tom Cruise also . good, good.". So three of us were very satisfied. and I said, " Jack, Bill, bye bye. And maybe we can see next time.".
Yes, I like to see the movie, but now I have a small baby so I can not find time to go to the cinema, you know. I have no private time.
My favorite movie? favorite movie, it's .
 so but in Japan, we also see the western movies, but in , you know, we also, .
Yes, my favorite Chinese movie maybe is "".
"". it described a life in a very, how to say, local suburb. So the life is not too good, but the people are very kind. but they have to survival for the life. They work very very hard. Yes. But something happened, some troubles. also, this is the love stories. And men and women, they fall in love, but finally, they have some problem. They can not be married, and yeah, they departed. but the woman, yeah, she could not forget the man. So finally, she made a suicide commitment. So it is very sad movie, I think. But yeah, it is very old movie when I was in , .
At that moment, I think. I was very impressed by this movie at that moment.
Yeah.
Yes, sure. 
Yes, quite busy.
Yes, especially now, we have a new comer changed yeah, a staff. Yeah. So I have to teach her many things. Yeah.
Yes, it's good 
Also in Japan, it's very challenging things yeah, to have a job and meanwhile to bearing the child, but I'm very satisfied with my life now. it's very challenging. It's very hard, but it's very good.
You're welcome.
