 my name is .
.
Nice to meet you.
.  is O K.
 everyone call me .
. Yeah.
 I'm fine. Yeah.
 I'm from .
And today,   I mean  I'm from .
 now. Yeah.
Area? It's  near the .       five-minutes distance by car from  to my place.
So  we can see   very much from my  apartment.
Yeah. It's really  good place.
 yes. .
. O K. I have a wife and a daughter. She's two years old .
And she speaks a bit Japanese and she's learning English  .
Yeah. She speaks English a bit. Maybe she's gonna be better than .
 because   when I used to live in ,   I spent a lot of time to  English. And so I want to make  bit more easier for her to learn to speak English. So, yeah, that's  the reason. Yeah.
.
  now   she's visiting a class. She join a  English class once a week.
  and she's singing English songs and playing with  native speakers' friends.  yeah,  so she's enjoying that very much. Yeah.
Yeah.
England? Yeah.  so   first time I visited  I mean England in nineteen-ninety-one as a student.
And I studied fine art,  this college, . And it's a first time.  as I felt  very difference from  Japan. It's a every culture and every life,   of course, language is completely different from Japan. So I spent a lot of time to used to listen .  but finally, I enjoyed the stay in . Yeah.
 yeah,   yeah, I studied fine art at college but I also play music
in . And    there's a big festival in club. And  art schools,   it's big organization of arts and music, and they invited me and my friends to play music there. So I played very   experimental music. And everyone enjoyed that very much. So  that was very impressive for me.
 yeah, it's a kind of synthesizer and making, yeah, .
And more experimental things. So I just combine these sounds together.
 it's not very music but it's very beautiful for .
 yeah.
.
Yeah.  so this is a classroom.   the teacher is teaching mathematics on blackboard and it's a writing a graphs.
 but there are, one, two, three, six,   maybe seven, more than seven students in a class. But most of the people are chatting and ignores the what teacher is saying. But  only some students are very interested in that mathematic class, I think.  and the one guy  wearing yellow shirts is bubbling the gums. And the two girls are chatting each other without seeing the teacher at all. And the one guy is wearing a stripe shirt is listening a music with headphones with drinking some soft drinks. And yeah,  that's it. 
       mostly the class is boring and especially mathematics is very   it's not interesting, sometimes very difficult to under stand. And I think  in these ages,  the students are more interested in themselves very much. So  they are not watching  what the teacher's doing.
.
  actually    I had a quite similar 
 as this picture. And     yeah, I like English and mathematics
 in a high school. But I didn't like  learning  chemicals and  Japanese language class. So I didn't see  what they doing.  I just try to sleep
 on the desk. So
 I can guess what they are  about.
Yeah.

Yeah.
 .
O K. .
O K.
 .
O K.      I bought a shirts and   pants  last week and  I brought it back to my home and weared it again. But it didn't fit to me very much, so I'd like to exchange these two items now.
 but   when I bought, I didn't fit  these two items in a shelf. And I ask some people  "Can we exchange this?". But they said, "Yes.". So that's why I just brought it back. Because  all fitting rooms are very busy and there's a more than five people chewing. So I was very busy  you know, to the next appointment. So I couldn't have time. So I just talked to some people in there.
Yeah.
 she said O K.   I don't remember her name. .
 yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah.
. So what can I do? Because the you know, it's not my false, I think. It's    I think   I have a fault but  your shop also has a fault, too. .
 yes,  yeah, if I can exchange these two items,
yeah,  yeah, yeah just O K. Yeah.
.
. All right. I'll just , yeah, name and telephone number here.
All right, thanks.
. Sure.
 very much.
Yeah.
    not big  problems but I have one trouble when I purchased a car.
 car. Yeah. They said it's no problem  to drive that car.
And I paid for it. And I just drived  five minutes to check the car's condition. It worked at that moment. But  when I went back to my home, I got a lot of problem about it. Exhaust and engine and clutches. So I just complained to the guy. But  you know, he didn't pay back any money. And yeah, he said  everything is owned by myself.
Yeah. So it cost a lot to fix the car.
. Yeah. Yeah.

That's the one of the biggest problem
of my  experience.
. Yeah.
 it's not car dealer because it's a privately.
 the car privately. .
Yeah. Because  you know,  I was a student there. I didn't have enough money to buy    the car from proper shop
 car dealers.
Yeah. So  I just checked the newspapers and magazines.
 check the many 
low-priced car and I just contacted the guy directly.
Yeah. .
 it worked. But not very good. Just it worked. Yeah.
.  when I left ,    I just left that car to my friend. And the friend enjoyed the car. At the first time,  they complained.
. And maybe    I mean,  they just left the car again. Yeah.
Yeah.
 no.
No.
, yeah.
Because it's too old. About ten years old car
when I left the car.
Yeah. So
I didn't get any money.

.
.
.
. O K.
O K.
. O K. One day week, I'm going to the same station as usual in the morning. And   I'm also wearing same coat and same 
 as usual. And I just went to platform waiting for the train. But then    the guy    next to me   very excited to talk with the another guy. And he just hit my bag. And the bag just fell  into the rail.
Yeah. And  you know, I just upset about that. And I just argued with the guy. But the guy didn't understand. " it's not my fault. What's going on?".
 you know, it's "I have a very  significant document here.  what's can do for me?". And I spend a lot of time, it was like this. It's arguing. But suddenly the train came into the platform and  they hit  I mean,  my bag. And I was so surprised because everything is here.  but when the train passed, the bag remained on the rail. So   I felt so happy. And I felt so comfortable with that. And the people working the train stations, they help me to  bring me back to me
  yeah, I was very happy.
 Comfortable.   Excuse me. Yeah.
 everything's, yeah, .
Yeah.
   maybe  I have the same action
 guy. Yeah. Maybe I complain
to the guy first. And "You just, you know, get down to the rail and just grab the bag for me," or something. I order him to do it.
 But if  you know, it's a train pass trough,      I was very shocked by that. So I would be shocked by that. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Yeah.   it's just almost the same.
Yeah.
.
 yeah, I have to ever  matter
 if I have very significant document  and datas here.
Yeah, so  yeah.
Yeah.
 not really.
   just going back to my home today.
 it's holiday today .
Yeah.
Yeah. .
Thanks.
