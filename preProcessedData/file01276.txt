And it's a first time. <SC>I didn't</SC> as I felt <F>uh</F> very difference from <F>er</F> Japan. It's a every culture and every life, <F>oh</F> <SC>langua</SC> of course, language is completely different from Japan. So I spent a lot of time to used to listen <??></??>. <SC>And</SC> but finally, I enjoyed the stay in <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>. Yeah.<F>Oh</F> yeah, <F>er</F> <SC>I</SC> yeah, I studied fine art at college but I also play musicin <H pn="others4">XXX05</H>.

And <H pn="others4">XXX05</H> art schools, <R>it's</R> <F>er</F> it's big organization of arts and music, and they invited me and my friends to play music there. So I played very <SC>in</SC> <F>er</F> experimental music. And everyone enjoyed that very much. So <SC>that's was</SC> that was very impressive for me.<F>Ah</F> yeah, it's a kind of synthesizer and making, yeah, <??></??>.And more experimental things. So I just combine these sounds together.<R>It's</R> it's not very music but it's very beautiful for <laughter>me</laughter>.<OL><F>Ah</F></OL> yeah.<OL><??></??></OL>.Yeah. <F>Er</F> so this is a classroom. <F>Um</F> <F>er</F> the teacher is teaching mathematics on blackboard and it's a writing a graphs.<SC>And</SC> but there are, one, two, three, six, <F>er</F> <R>maybe se</R> maybe seven, more than seven students in a class. But most of the people are chatting and ignores the what teacher is saying. But <SC>some students</SC> only some students are very interested in that mathematic class, I think. <R>And</R> and the one guy <?>that's</?> wearing yellow shirts is bubbling the gums. And the two girls are chatting each other without seeing the teacher at all. And the one guy is wearing a stripe shirt is listening a music with headphones with drinking some soft drinks. And yeah, <.></.> that's it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Oh</F> <R>I think it's</R> <..></..> <F>um</F> <SC>I think it's <F>er</F> teacher's</SC> <.></.> <?>because</?> mostly the class is boring and especially mathematics is very <F>um</F> <.></.> it's not interesting, sometimes very difficult to under stand. And I think <SC>it's <F>er</F> these ages</SC> in these ages, <F>er</F> the students are more interested in themselves very much. So <R?>they are</R?> they are not watching <SC>what's teacher's tea</SC> what the teacher's doing.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<OL><F>Oh</F> yeah, <F>uh</F></OL> <F>er</F> actually <SC>it's</SC> <F>er</F> <SC>I have</SC> I had a quite similar <OL>experience</OL><nvs>laughter</nvs> as this picture.
