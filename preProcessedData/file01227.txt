.
 my name is .
Yes.
Nice to see you, too.
 good.
. .
 I don't know. I like to play sports, .
.
 I like to play badminton.
And
throw a Frisbee around.
Yeah.
 I used to play it at school when I was in junior high school
as a, like school subject.
And I liked it then. .
 second year.
 I like here but sometimes I feel it's too busy.
Because we have lots of events.
.
.
We have Sports Day.
And our school festival
in autumn.
Yeah.
I live in .
 almost all my life. I moved to when I was five .

my father is a pastor. And 
 used to be an English teacher at .
And now she's working for a , translation company.
And I have one older brother and an older sister.
They're both students.
And, yeah, that's about that.

 I think it's good to be born in a pastor's family 
 live I don't know, because in Japan, Christianity is very, like minority.
And
if it wasn't for my father, I wouldn't have known Christianity, 
I think it's good.
 because I like to study foreign languages.
And I've been studying English for many years.
And I thought this school would be like the best school for me to develop my English skill.
Because this school has many English classes. And there are many foreign teachers.
And all the curriculum is good than other schools.
 like all the students are divided into small groups
 according to their abilities
and so we can get like appropriate
classes like, you know, level and .
.
Yes.
 I think it's a math class.
And this teacher is teaching but most of the students seem not very concentrated. And one boy is drinking
while he's listening to music.
 another boy is chewing gum. And girls are talking to each other. but the teacher doesn't seem to care.
So kind of interesting .

 I quite similar, actually.
 yeah, sometimes we are not very concentrated.
And we're not this bad like drinking like this you know,
 sometimes we're not very good .
 I think she has to try to get more attention
 students.
Like for example to, like say "Be quiet"

things like that. and try to make her class interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
 about Japanese school having ?
.
Yeah. I think it's good
for because I don't have to spend lot of time in the morning thinking and then choosing what to wear.
 so I think it's very time .

O K.
O K.
 am I ?
.
 so I have to, O K.
 this is .

 you invited me to a dinner party.
But I couldn't make it because I had something to do. .

, I know. I'm sorry. But the situation is out of my control
and I'm very sorry to miss it. I really want to go, but I can't. I'm sorry.

. I wish I was there. .
 my mother told me to clean the house.

 Sorry. It's very urgent. Because we are expecting a visitor tomorrow
 I have to do it today.
And my sister was told to do that but she went out.
So I have to do that.
.
. .
But
please invite me again if you have another party.
 please tell them I'm so sorry and that it's not my fault, it's my mother and sister's fault. 
So sorry.
O K.
.
Bye.


 I don't think so.
.
 I think it was last summer
when I had my friend's birthday party .
 my family had two American men stay at our house for like several weeks.
And it was one of those men's birthday.
So we had a party.
.
 they were short-time missionaries from a college in America.
And they come every year to help our church.
Yeah.
It was fun.
Yeah.
 they come as a team of about ten people.
 came and some other people in church, too.
So it was really . But was fun. Lots of food and games and, .
O K.
 one day last week, 
we went to a camp
with my friend.
 we went by car
and went to a riverside and made up a tent. And we were having fun. But then it started to rain.
And it got pretty wild.
And so we had to go back to the car.
And we looked for some place to stay
that night.
And we found a hotel near the riverside. So we stayed there instead of sleeping in a tent.
.
Yeah.
 I think it's because more and more people are living in cities
and there are not much nature
in cities. So they like to go somewhere to enjoy
the nature.
.
.
 we used to go camping a lot,
yeah, when I was little.
 recently, we don't do much.
Because my brother is not living with us any more.
He's living in a dorm.
And my sister she is preparing to go to a music school.
So she has to study a lot. 
we can't make time for family thing.
. .
O K.
 I have to go back to my classroom and take the class.
Yeah.
 it's a classic Japanese.
And then after that, I have French class.
And I'll go home and I don't know what I'll .
. .
But not today.

O K. .
