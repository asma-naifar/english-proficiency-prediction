?
My name is  .
Yes.
 I'm fine.
 this morning,   I had my job seminar at my university.
So I went to university.
.
Yes.
Yes. That's right. Sport festival .
Yes.
.
       a kind of mass communication company's staff  came to our university and   make lecture
to student  what they do in the company.
.
.
I wanna be   radio  personality.
So I'm interested in radio company.
.  because   I'm not good at speaking or hearing English, so maybe at first      I will not be a main personality   to meet  to    artists.
So I think   I want to start  as  weather personality or traffic jam personality.
And    I will make my career .
 .
 I live at  student dormitory in .
.
At dormitory?
    I live there with   one student,
with Sophia University student because   it costs only one hundred yen to live in dormitory  .
 so we are scholarship students
that dormitory.
So     .
So     she is  younger than me
by two years.
.
.
Two years?
. Yeah. 
.  O K.    I think the teacher  is  teaching a 
mathematics class.
 some students  are  in mathematics.  maybe they are  mathematics but  other students  seems to be boring. So    they are talking or listening music,  drinking .
 .  But  maybe the teacher    she doesn't care about it.
So  she continue teaching.
.     the biggest difference is   that   we must wear  our school's clothes.
But they're    their own clothes.
And     my high school has very strict rule, so   we could not change or we couldn't dye our hair but he has yellow hair.
  we have to  be quiet and we have to   listen to our teachers. But they're talking     they  are making their nails.
  we couldn't drink  something,
in our classroom.
And we couldn't use    this tool.
So that's all.
.
.
   will you do me a favor?
    this morning      I bought this earrings.
Yeah,    but  then    I was wondering   which is better for me,   this one or that one. So  at last  I chose this one. But 
   at my house,  I change my mind.
But  I wanna have that one. So   would you change my pierce to that one?
 but   this one resemble that one. So  the difference is just color.
So the same form  and same looks, but only just color.
So   if I buy that one    maybe   I will have a  similar  ones.
So    I don't like only color. So I like both. So I want change. .
Yeah. .

 but    I was a freshman  in my university.  I went to Kichijoji. I went to Isetan because  it was a season of bargain. So  I wanted to buy cheaper than usual case.
But  I knew that   we couldn't change   the clothes because it was a  very cheaper than usual, it's bargain goods. But  after my buying the clothes,  I don't like ,
the color.
So it was green one at first,  I wanted to change  to blue one. So    I   luckily,    I found  some wrong part of the clothes. And    it has a small dirty part.
. 
Yeah.
So, actually I had  new green one.   but   I want the staff of shop to change to blue one.
   I could get it.
