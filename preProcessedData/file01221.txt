Good afternoon.<F>Um</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sure.I'm fine.<OL>How about</OL> you?Yes.<OL><F>Um</F></OL> after school, <F>well</F> I don't have any plans, so I just gonna go home and relax.<F>Um</F> no, I don't. But <SC>it's</SC> I'm a third year, so I don't think any <R>p</R> people belongs to any club any more.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Er</F> when I was in America, I belonged to tennis club. Yeah.<F>Um</F> summer of two-thousand two.<F>Um</F> I like it because <F>um</F> my parents doesn't have to take me anywhere by car because I can take trains. But I don't like how it's crowded and <SC>it's</SC> it seems little busyin Japan.<F>Um</F> I like going out with my friends or <F>um</F> staying at home and read magazines. <F>Hm</F>.<OL>Or some</OL> books.<F>Um</F> I read many, like fashions or maybe entertainment. <F>Um</F> <?>but that's</?> <OL>about it</OL>.<F>Um</F> I think there are more advertisement in American magazine compared to Japanese magazines.<F>Um</F> <F>well</F> my dad <SC>is</SC> <F>um</F> he's a salary man. <F>Um</F> but he works for a company where like there are many <F>er</F> companies in different countries. So <F>um</F> he goes to other countries such as like U. S. A's and <SC>visit</SC> <SC>he</SC> few weeks ago he visited <F>er</F> Hungary.<OL>And</OL> my mom is <F>um</F> <F>er</F> she does a part-time job teaching <F>um</F> young children English. <F>Um</F> and she likes playing tennis, too.<F>Um</F> just a little but not much.<F>Um</F> I think my mom's <F>um</F> life change because she started working part-time job. And my dad <SC>work</SC> <F>um</F> change because <F>well</F> his <F>um</F> <F>er</F> <F>well</F> working place is little bit far from <SC>here</SC> my house compared to <SC>my</SC> our house in America. So sometime <SC>he ge</SC> he come back home little tired <nvs>laughter</nvs> because of the crowded trains.<OL>O K</OL>.<F>Um</F> this is a classroom with <F>um</F> <SC>a <SC>w</SC> lady</SC> a teacher teaching. I think it's a math class. But <SC>not many people</SC> not much students are listening because I can see people who are <F>um</F> eating gum and looking out the window and girls chatting. And she has her makeup on her desk and the mirrors. And there are a boy who is listening to music, he's drinking <F>um</F> soda. <SC>But there are few students who are listening because I can see a boy who's taking notes and a girl who's using</SC> <F>er</F> <F>um</F> only a boy is listening to a teacher because I can see he is taking a note. But a boy next to him is, <F>um</F> I think, doing E-mails by using his cell phone. And <.></.> <F>um</F> I think that's <OL>about it</OL>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Hm</F>.<F>Um</F> <CO>I think our classroom is much better because we don't chew our gums and <SC>our</SC> <F>well</F> <SC>we</SC> maybe some people are chewing gums but they don't show like they don't</CO>. <F>Um</F> and we don't drink soda or any drinks during class. And <F>um</F> although we do some discussions, <R>we are not</R> we are not gonna chat and we don't have our makeup out in our desk. And we are never gonna listen to our music when you have class.<F>Um</F> not <laughter>very much</laughter>.<F>Um</F> first, I think she should tell students to <F>um</F> concentrate on the class. And I think she should <F>um</F> make more class interesting by not using only books but maybe try to do worksheets or <F>um</F> ask students questions. <F>Hm</F>.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.Yes.<F>Um</F> I think <F>er</F> <SC>it's</SC> I like wearing uniform because it's kind of represent we are from one school and we have like unity <?>in our</?> school. <F>Um</F> and I like how our uniform is not like set completely. Like we don't have to wear certain socks or certain shirts but we get to choose. So I think that's the way, how we show our characteristic in this school.<F>Um</F>.<?>School</?> regulation. <F>Um</F> basically we have to respect other people and <F>er</F> we have to wear uniforms, <F>um</F> and <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> we are not allowed to ride bikes to school.<OL>We only</OL> have to walk or use trains. And other rules are just like basic<F>urm</F> stuff like we are not allowed to do, like listen to music during class. It doesn't say in our handbook, but it's <F>um</F> kind of we know it, we have to do. <nvs>laughter</nvs><OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>. <F>Um</F> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> not O K, but <F>um</F> so <SC?>you don't</SC?> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>they don't tell us</R> they don't tell us we can't do that but we just know it so we don't do it. <F>Mm-hm</F>.<OL><?>You're welcome</?></OL>.O K.O K.<OL>O K</OL>.O K.Right. <OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Um</F> I just bought this <F>um</F> outfit few days ago.

So may I have it paid back or exchange it?<CO><F>Uh</F> <SC>so I have</SC> <F>well</F> <F>eh</F> can I exchange it to any outfit over there with same price or</CO>?<OL><F>Uh</F> <SC>ss</SC></OL> O K. So <SC>you're not</SC> you can't return money for me?<F>Um</F> then <SC>what</SC> are there any other options that you can do?<F>Oh</F> because <F>um</F> I thought it was <??></??> under these lights, it was different from my house. And when I was at home where it was little brighter, I thought the color was little different. And this store here is a little bit darker than my house, so it was kind of different than I thought.<OL>So</OL><F>well</F> <SC>I ca</SC> I couldn't help it.Yes. I tried it on but still the brightness of this store and the outside in house <SC>is</SC> was different.

But <F>ah</F> I don't think so because I always wear <?>it</?>, check <SC>ma</SC> to make sureif it fits me.I like going shopping with my mother because some of friends have different taste <SC>of</SC> in fashion with me. But I don't like going alone because there are no one to advise whether I look good in it. So and I trust my mom<OL>to what</OL> to say. SoI like going shopping with my mother.<OL><F>Mh-hmm</F></OL>.<F>Um</F> <F>er</F> it depends on how much I want it but if I really want it, I think I'm gonna buy it. So I don't have to regret.O K.O K.<OL>O K</OL>.O K. O K. <F>Um</F> last week, <SC>my p</SC> my friend and I decided to go camping. So we packed our stuff and we got ready and went to the mountain. When we reached the mountain, <SC>we</SC> what we first did was <F>um</F> <SC>to build a</SC> <F>um</F> <F>um</F> we build our house. And we cooked. And <SC>we got already</SC> we got ready and we had so much fun. But few hours later, it started raining. So I told my friend we should go home. But my friend said <F>um</F> "No, it's not a big deal. So we should stay.". So we decided to stay. But an hour later, it got worse and everything started to blow and we couldn't stay here any more. So we <F>er</F> got in our car and started driving. After we drove for a few minutes, we saw a hotel. So we decided to stay at hotel <SC>tonight</SC> <F>uh</F> that night. So we checked in and <SC>we had <F>ur</F> so</SC> we had <SC>a great</SC> so much fun in the hotel. And we just relax and had a cup of coffee.<F>Um</F> not very <laughter>much</laughter>. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I us</R> I used to be in a girl scout but I did not have a <SC>good</SC> very good experience in there. Because <F>um</F> I went canoeing one time, but it was kind of awful because <SC>I didn't like ca</SC> I couldn't swim. So since then I don't like camping and <SC>k</SC> outdoor <laughter>activities</laughter>.<F>Um</F> because <F>er</F> my friend was in it. And it was <SC>only</SC> not only outdoor activities. <SC>We s</SC> <F>er</F> she said we gotta sell cookies and we're gonna <F>um</F> play with little children. So I thought it was interesting. It was interesting but not only <laughter>canoeing</laughter>. Everything except canoeing was very fun.I think so.<OL>Because</OL> you can experience so much things and <F>um</F> <SC>you can't do</SC> <SC?>e</SC?> you can't experience by yourself. So I think it was very good.Thank <OL>you</OL>.O K.Thank you.<F>Um</F>.<F>Er</F> between the Christmas and New Year's, so twenty-seventh to twenty-ninth, I went to my grandparents' house in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.Yes. <SC>It was</SC> I haven't met them since about three years ago.<CO>So I was very</CO>.Thank you.
