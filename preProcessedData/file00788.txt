One day last week,
I went to the station
 baggage
 baggage
 which I just bought
yesterday.
And while I was waiting at the station,
 the man next to me
just hit me with his elbow.
Then I dropped the baggage
on a rail.
Then you know, sorry, he seems 
He doesn't know what to do.
Then of course I don't know should I jump on to the rail .
But I think that's dangerous.
 and then the train just came in, and I was surprised and shocked to see " My God, my baggage is going to be broken.".
And my fiance's .
 thanks, God.
The train just stopped
front of the baggage.
That was safe. I mean that was O K.
So I asked the station man to take the baggage, and I got it.
.
 I always feel like you know, I said I live in .
I always 
 to get school.
And lines in a morning
especially in a morning, it's really really crazy crowded.
 I always hold my bag like this, and
just wait. I mean you know, just try to forget the time passes.
I .
I hate the crowd. 
 sometimes you know, old guys, .
In summer, sweaty .
Yeah.
. especially.
 I'm going to go home straightly.
That's boring.
.
. Yes.
. Thank you very much. I really enjoyed .
