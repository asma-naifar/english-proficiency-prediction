My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Nice to meet you, too.I'm fine. Yeah. <F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F> I work in the skin technical group and I'm mainly <F>umm</F> responsible for skin lightning project.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F>. I like my job because <F>umm</F> I do many type of things. Make a formulation and go to the factory, and <R>it</R> it's not always the same type of work, so it's very <F>umm</F> fun to do.<OL><F>Um</F></OL>.<OL><F>Umm</F> <F>um</F></OL>.<F>Umm</F> the difficulty is <F>umm</F> <R>how to</R> <F>uum</F> how to achieve <R>the</R> <F>umm</F> the project because <SC>it</SC> it's not just simply make a formulation and then it goes to the market. <R>It</R> it's a total market mix so <R>that</R> that's the hard point. <CO>It's difficult to explain but</CO>. <F>Mmm</F>.<F>Umm</F> I like to go to <F>umm</F> like <F>umm</F> natural place like Nasu or like Nikko <OL>for a drive</OL>,and have a cup of tea.<OL><F>Umm</F></OL>. <F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F> <SC>pretty</SC> <laughter>I think so</laughter>. <laughter>Pretty good</laughter>. <F>Uum</F>.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F> I don't like <F>umm</F> busy places like Tokyo. <F>Umm</F> <F>umm</F>. That was one reason why I choose this company <laughter>so</laughter>.<F>Umm</F> <F>umm</F>. I like to live in <F>ahh</F> not busy place like Tokyo. <F>Umm</F> so I feel very comfortable here.<OL><F>Umm</F> <F>umm</F></OL>.I'm from <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<OL><F>Uhh</F></OL> there's so many people. It's very crowded, too. <F>Mmm</F>.<F>Umm</F> my family, I have a husband and I have no children. And <R>that</R> <SC>that's living in</SC> we're living in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>. <F>Umm</F>.<F>Uh</F> my husband works at <F>umm</F> hospital and he's a social worker.Yeah. <F>Un</F> <F>un</F>. He works near <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> <SC>the next <F>umm</F> <.></.> to</SC> next to <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, so <SC>he's pretty close to</SC> his job places pretty close.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Um</F> actually he's from the same university.And we were in the same laboratory in the university. But <SC>he worked there as a <F>um</F> in</SC> <F>ahh</F> <F>umm</F> <.></.> <R>he</R> he changed his job, so that's why <R>it</R> it seems like it's very different from my job.<F>Un</F> <F>un</F>.<F>Umm</F> he worked as a scientist also <F>mmm</F> in a different company. But he changed his job.<F>Umm</F>. It doesn't suit him,and I thought so, too. He likes to make a communication with people more than to do things with other scientists. <F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F> <F>um</F>.Yes.<F>Umm</F> this seems to be like a <F>umm</F> class. And the teacher is <F>umm</F> teaching about <F>umm</F> mathematics, I thinks. <F>Umm</F> <SC>people</SC> the students are <laughter>pretty</laughter> not listening to the teacher. <F>Umm</F>. <.></.><R>Any</R> anything else? <F>Umm</F> it seems like a high school student or something. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.Yes. Yeah. I enjoyed it very much.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F> <SC>I wasn't</SC> people were not <F>umm</F> like drinking or like having chewing gum or listening to music. <.></.> <F>Ah</F> they were like listening to the teacher or sleeping. <laughter>So</laughter> <R>it</R> it wasn't like this. <F>Um</F>.This seems <R>like more</R> like <?>my</?> <R>in</R> in <?>my like English</?> or America or something.<F>Umm</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Umm</F> like drinking or like listening to music <R>it</R> it seems like in my image in America they doing that in a class. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Umm</F> Not in America. <SC>I was</SC> I lived in <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>, so it's a little bit different, <F>umm</F> I think.<F>Umm</F> <R>in</R> in my own opinion <F>umm</F> like <R>I</R> I think it's because I see like American movies <OL><laughter>and then</laughter></OL>,when there's a scene,<F>um</F> of the high school. It's not so good. <OL><R>The</R></OL><R>the</R> their attitude are not good. So that image comes to me.<F>Um</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F>.Yes, I enjoyed it. <OL><F>Um</F> <F>um</F></OL>.<OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Umm</F>.<laughter>O K</laughter>.<F>Umm</F> I would like to ask one thing. <F>Umm</F> I bought this <F>umm</F> from your shop.But <F>umm</F> it doesn't seem to suit me, so <SC>I would like this</SC> I would to have this back <F>um</F> and exchange it to money or something else. <SC>Is that</SC> <F>umm</F> am I able to do that?<F>Mmm</F> I understand it was on sale, but <F>umm</F> <R>even</R> even that, I heard that <R>if</R> if it's not a sale, <F>umm</F> you can have it back, so I definitely want the money back.Could you talk to someone in your shop?<F>Umm</F> when the manager comes back? Could you talk to him and give me a call?<F>Umm</F> I'll wait, but I want to talk to him.O K. Thank you <OL>very much</OL>.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Ummmm</F> no. <F>Ummm</F> even if I don't like it, <R>I</R> I don't go to the shop and say "I want my money back.". <F>Um</F> <F>um</F> so I don't have this kind of conversation.<laughter><R>Right</R></laughter> right.<F>Umm</F> <.></.> not often this kind of thing happens to me so. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>. But even if I don't like it, I go to a recycle shop and then sell it.<F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Ummm</F> recently there's many recycle shops in Japan. And they sell many things like clothes or toys or like electric things.So they would buy it from us and sell it as a reasonable price.<F>Umm</F>.Yeah. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Umm</F> <SC>I went to the</SC> <F>umm</F> I went to <H pn="others3">XXX05</H> when I was about eight years old.And I stayed there for four years.And because I was a child <F>umm</F> <SC>I first</SC> when I first went to the class, I didn't know any English because my parents had a policy not to <SC>teach English</SC> force me to <F>um</F> teach English before I go there.So I didn't know anything and I was so confused, so I had some trouble, <R>but</R> but everybody was so kind and the teacher was so kind, too. <F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F>.<F>Umm</F>. One point that I was very very <F>umm</F> that reminds me of the experience in U K. <F>Umm</F> I couldn't speak English and in the morning, the teacher <F>um</F> calls everybody's name, <SC>whether they're</SC> whether he or she is here or not. And when she asks my name, <F>um</F> I didn't answer anything for like month or two months.<SC>And</SC> but everybody was <F>um</F> answering "Yes, Mrs Teacher or something.". So I once tried for first time, and when I tried, everybody was so happy and everybody was so like fascinating. And I mean, <R>I</R> I think that kind of <F>um</F> atmosphere doesn't happen in Japan. <SC>I didn't</SC> I haven't experienced anything in Japan. So I thought, "<F>Wow</F> this English people <SC>was</SC> is very very nice and kind.". <OL><F>Umm</F></OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<OL>Yeah, yeah</OL>. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Yes.O K.<.></.> <F>Um</F> using all this one?<F>Er</F>.Can I start?One day last week, I was driving a car and then <F>um</F> <SC>the</SC> <SC>a bike</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>who</SC> a man was driving a bike and was calling with a mobile phone and when I tried to turn to the left, I bumped into his bike. <R>And the</R> and then the bike was broken, but not so bad. But the man who was on the bike, <F>um</F> argued, <SC>as</SC> like it was <SC>my</SC> all my fault. So I was very upset because he was not concentrating how to drive or whether he was driving safely and I was very upset because he was calling with a mobile phone and I think he shouldn't do that. So when the police came, I talked to the policemen that he was calling while he was driving the bike. And then the police understood the situation <SC>and the bike was <F>um</F> taken away for</SC> <F>ah</F> <.></.> <nvs>laughter</nvs> and the bike was <F>umm</F> taken with the truck,and <SC>everybody</SC> <R>e</R> everything was settled down.<nvs>laughter</nvs>.<OL>Yeah, <F>umm</F> <F>umm</F></OL>.I think they shouldn't do that. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>. I think it's too dangerous.Right. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.Yes, I use it, but I try to not to use it <R>whi</R> while I'm driving. <F>Um</F> <F>um</F>.<F>Um</F> <.></.> I don't like people who gets like suddenly upset,and like argue as if it's <SC>all their fault</SC> <R>all the</R> <F>um</F> all the other one's fault.<F>Umm</F> <.></.> <R>it's</R> it's like debating and <SC>how to</SC> <SC>how try to</SC> how to try to get their merit. But <R>I</R> I don't like these kind of people.<OL><F>Um</F></OL> <F>uum</F>.This afternoon, I am going to <F>umm</F> check the presentation charts.<F>Umm</F>. A big presentation is coming next week.<F>Umm</F>. <CO><OL>So</OL></CO>.<OL><F>Um</F> my boss</OL> is going to <R>h</R> <SC>have</SC> <F>um</F> give the presentation.So, I am going to check the scenario,and the charts and <OL><??></??></OL>.<OL><laughter>Yeah</laughter></OL>.<OL><laughter>Yes, behind</laughter></OL>.Thank you very much.Thank you very much.
