 I'm .
 to meet you.
Yes, .
 I live in .   my house is near   station.
 nice place.
No. I live with  my bird
and  my friend.
.   his color is blue.
  
 maybe,     .
I'm sorry. I don't .
.
. ,  no. But   he gives me
 much love,
so
 I love him, too.
  but actually,
I don't like to care
 of   him

because  he is very noisy
and  he is very selfish.   so sometimes,  I get angry. 
 so-so.
    I had to go to  ALC's program  twice a week,  so  just busy, but of course,  I enjoyed it.
Yes.
. I'm salesperson. .
But my office is in my house, so  that is  for me.
    a kind of computer system,  software or something.    but I can't  make  software.  I just sell.
  no.   if my customer  ask me about the computer system,      I will ask my    
about that.
 and     he will teach  the customer  about the system.

   this is a kind of party.   no. No.       this place is a restaurant.    three couples  eat some dishes. Maybe,     they are lovers. .    a woman       who wear pink color dress   is looking  her boyfriend.
I am sorry.
.  I don't have any plan  in Christmas,  but     I prefer going to  amusement park
 than nice restaurant. 
   because I have to eat nice dinner  very quietly 
  noble restaurant.
But  amusement park is  so noisy.   if  the amusement park  is too crowded,   I will enjoy,  some rice or something. 
.
Yes.
.  would you tell me    how much cost  to New York
by train?
.  I'm sorry.  I don't have much money,  so I'd like to buy cheap ticket.
. It's O K. .    and could you tell me    how to get to from here to New York?   which  platform?
. Thank you. .  Thank you for your kindness.
Good-bye.
   so much.   I like to  ride  airplane.
.
.
Because airplane is very  convenient for me. .      I have to take   short time  and    that is  less tiring  than train.
.
"Last week"?
  Takeshi loved Hiroko,   so        he thank to that.   they went to zoo.   so he  called her, and he asked her             she liked zoo or not. . Hiroko's answer is "yes.". So  he drove his car,  and they went to a zoo.  Hiroko wanted to see  lion's area, so they went to there. And  they enjoyed seeing  lion.  But   she was afraid of lion,  because the lion barked her.  And then, they went to monkey's area.  A monkey was very pretty,   so     she said to him,   "I want to pick up you in my house.".  But  the monkey   didn't say anything.   and then,  they came back home.   but he  forgot his car,    so   they walked.
 yes. . Because  there are many kinds of animals, so  that is  very useful to talk each other about that.
     I will continue  studying English
very hard .
  so-so. 
anyway,   I want to learn English, and I want to go to Hawaii someday.  so,
  I will continue
studying English.
Thank you .
