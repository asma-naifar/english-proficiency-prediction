And she was looking for the birthday present for her husband.        she  thought,  "What present  I buy for him?". She  decided  that  she bought a tie   the color is green and yellow. So,  it looks good and,  fit for him,   she thought. And,   she said, "  I'd like to buy this tie.",  said to the clerk. And   she got the tie   that is the present  for her husband. She was really happy. So     she looked around         the store.     when she  come back to home, and she looked around  inside the store, she found,         very nice  pair of  shoes.  she found  the paper that says final sale, thirty per cent off. " good," she thought.   she wanted to buy the shoes for her.  and    she got  ones. And            sorry,    she got  the  pair of shoes for her. And next, she found   the wonderful dress shirt,  she wanted to buy, too.   thirty per cent off.  it's good sale. And  she bought  the nice  yellow,   dress shirt. And she  was satisfied with  the goods, and she went out from the department store.
