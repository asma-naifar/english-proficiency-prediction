 I went to America and Europe countries and some Asian countries.
 it depends on the  reason to go,  because     if I want to    enjoy the vacation, I want to go to Asian countries. Because  it is very cheap and  I think Asian food is very delicious and people is very kind for us. So I think  it's good. And  if I  live in the foreign country, I want to live in Europe countries because I think it's very safe and      I think I'm not confuse   with their culture or like habits.
