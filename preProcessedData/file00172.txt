Hello.

Yes.
 Yes. I like skiing.
But,  recently,  I haven't   ski, because    last year I had a baby.

Too small.
Baby?   last year    May ninety-ninth,   he was born. And now is  one and half  years old.    now  he can  run around   my house. So  he can broke something   for example  window       and       I will be afraid  my  video tape recorder,   will be broken in the future.
I'm very anxious about that.  So   he is  ac But we cannot say "Stop" "Don't"   to the baby.    I am  annoy,   because I can't say baby "Stop". But  I hope,   the baby  don't break the something.

Weekends?   weekends .  .   we always go to the park  near my house. And    he is not  good at  playing  in     sandy place. So    we try to let him  play the sand place
recently.
     excuse me,  he already go to the kindergarten  every day. So the teacher    asked us  to   let him  play    in the  sand place.
Because   he seem to  dislike to play sand and make  dirty,
he dislike.

And    on the  side walk  one man is running. And    two ladies  speak  together  about   a rumor of  times. And  other person,  is reading on the bench   outside. . .  Cat. Cat is    snoozing on the   roof of a car.
Unfortunately,   I can see  the situation.

Last week? .
.
. Yeah.   one day last week,    I met   my father. So  we went to a restaurant  to eat a something.  So   my father   has already reserved    table  in the restaurant   with me.    so   he said,   then, " whichever you want to eat.".  So      I could eat   everything I want to eat.  So  I order   a waitress,     what I want to eat.    and in the dinner time,  we had a good time. So we drink  beer very much and fish  or   something .  I was satisfied   with  dinner. My father, too,   drink  wine  and   he likes  chicken  foods so he ate   chicken foods very much. And then     , he paid    a lot of money with dinner so I was,  satisfied   with dinner.  But  I didn't know  how much   it cost  to eat    at restaurant.  he just know  only  the cost. And then,             how can I say,      we say "Bye-bye,"    in front of the restaurant.
That's all.
Yes. I like alcohol especially  Japanese .
.   I like beer, too. But   it  is not good for me to drink a beer.
  beer becomes    my health   worse.
Yes.
.  Japanese  is better than beer.
  I'd like to   drink  with  co-worker.
Because   I like   discussion or conversation with  co-worker. So    if I go to the bar alone,  it's boring because  we can't speak.
  if possible     we will  go abroad.
. Guam or Saipan
with the baby.
Because   baby's  flight fee  is  for free.
Yes. Until three years or four years old,  baby's flight fee is free.
 It's reasonable
to go abroad
within baby's  is  three years old.
