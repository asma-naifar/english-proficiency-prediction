I'm from   prefecture.
And  I'm living in City. It's a     of  Prefecture,
and I use  Line.
I use  Line,
from my house.
 it was typical suburb area.
 so many residence but some of  are looks very rural. 
 so there are so many  rice fields
and   fields. 
. 
.
 I don't do nothing much right now, but
 worked for six years 
  
  home builder.
And  I used to work there as a interior decorator
 for a while. And  that was very interesting job.  for instance,     I chose  some interior elements
 my client
. So about   home.
.
Yes. I'm thinking now. But 
 nowaday, I'm very  interesting in the improving my English so
 I'm thinking  my future  from now  which way to go.
Yes, I married.
And  I'm living with  my husband and   he works   at the .
And      he doesn't work  regularly.
I mean  he is  a pilot,
of airline company.
  sometimes he wakes up very early 
he comes very late.
So that's  a another point that makes me  a next job</SC>
to decide my next job. 
if I choose 
 I mean  a kind of a full-time job,
 it makes  me to avoid   together
time because  I think  I would not be meet him
not so much.
That's why.
 yes, my hobby is a   maybe reading book.
My hobby. 
 
any type of  recently,    I forgot 
the English title.
 the books was about   the how to read people
 or something.
The author is a  who works  at a company to decide  ,
  and  it's very important      to choose the    because the trial
is depending on jury.
Isn't it so? That's why so  she writes about   to read the people by the behavior
or by   pronunciation and  by hair style .
Yes, it is.
Yes.
Yes.  it seems  girl's room. And  the girls  has a  room. It is totally furnished .
 and  she has her maybe personal computer and typewriter and   audio set.
And  she has her own phone.
  and I think she has a cat and dog
as pet.  it looks very cozy room. But I think if she were  so young
like a high school or junior high school, it is totally 
  too luxury for her, I think.
.
.
 For her?
High school girl? O K.  O K,  maybe I ask her     are there any  unconfidential element
in her room. And    maybe I picked some elements   with her.  and I recommend her to choose      the color of fabrics.
.   because   it seems very    unorganized.
 the tone and the color is  so  . So I recommend her to decide  main color and  .
.

Yes.

I'm sorry. But   I couldn't come your dinner party.  O K  I have been  very sick
   for six days.
 I couldn't come. I try to call you, but  I was in hospital. So, .
I'm sorry. .
 yes. I think so.

 I think  it would be much better to stay home for me right now, because this illness is very  contagious.
 I wonder someone catch my cold or flu or something. So it would be  bad     for your customer  that   they catch .
 ?
But I think this flu is very very serious.  I think if they catch  big cold
  they will feel very sick at stomach.
  so I don't want make them such feeling. 
I think I would avoid.

and it's kind of expensive
for a necktie. . But it wasn't brand.  and  I don't think this  is very  . But  anyway
. And    on my way home,   I looked a final sale of shoes and  I was very  interested in  one shoes. But I didn't have much money
 to buy  because I spended a lot. And  another corner I found  a  clothing and  it was a sale also. And   I was very interested in this  orange blouse and  it was made of silk. And   I was going to another  party.  and    I think my friend   would like this.    so I choose this. And  it costed    ten thousand yen, too.  finally,  I bought this.
