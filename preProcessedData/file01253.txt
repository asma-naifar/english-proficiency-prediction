So like I went to the fridge and opened the fridge and there was this big cake for me. And then   my brother came behind me and said, "You saw the ."

.
.
One day last week.
O K. One day last week, a man was 
sorry,   yeah, driving down the street.   same road and they told him what happened. And the man driving the car  explained that  the bike man was using his cell phone and not looking properly at the road. So it's  his fault. And the policeman agreed with the man driving the car.   so   the man driving the car got free and the bike man  was going to pay him? I mean, not pay him.   so the bike man was going to      clean up his mess all by himself. And he also had to hire a truck so  he could  take his bike back home.
Yeah.
In .
  traffic system.  when I was there,     I mean you know, I hardly had the chance to  ride on bikes or ride cars.  so I don't really know, but over there, the road is really  wide compared to Japan so you don't really, I mean crush into things really.  but once my brother was riding in his  bicycle, and he crushed into a man  riding a motorbike. Yeah. Like my brother was really stupid.   he was  holding ice creams in both hands and riding .  yeah.  that was really terrible to him because the bike man said it's my brother's fault. And  it is his fault because  yeah, he wasn't being careful.
. And we had to pay    for the things that was broken. Yeah,  the man riding the motor bike also had on this leather jacket. And he ripped it so we had to pay for that as well. Yeah.
It was terrible. We had to pay lots of money.
 yeah, he was fine. 
.
 yeah.
 it's really fun.  yeah, it's really better than junior high.
 it was really strict.
Yeah. It's public but it's strict like private school.
Yeah, much .
