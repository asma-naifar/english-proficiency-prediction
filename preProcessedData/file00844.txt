My name is .
Yes.
I'm fine. 
Sorry,    I'm sorry for  being so late.
.
.
.
  compared with yesterday.
  I got Tokyo  last night,
 I felt very cold.
 but  it's very fine. .
In winter?
   usually,   I,   yeah,  watch the movie  in my house   and watch T V.
.
  just looking.    not  especially.
.
     if I have  
enough spare time,  I'd like to go oversea
    to see   wild  area. . For example,     I'm found of   developing country.    they have a lot of nature, and  they have   much energy   I can feel.
So  I'd like to go.
Yes.
Yes.
.
        first of all,  I think   difference  than  city area
 countryside in Japan
    people who live in countryside  are very friendly and very open-minded.
 but,     for example,     people who live in Tokyo are      very cold   but   look like smart. .
.
  with my friend.
Yes.
   it depends on  their schedule.
So very   different person
    when  I went   overseas. . For example,       he is policeman  but   doesn't like police 
  discount or cheap.   he not have .

Yes.
 Yes.   this is picture of  a room.       but   I imagine that Japanese typical room.  . There are a lot of  instrument in this room. For example,    there is a desk  near the window. .    there is the  personal computer on the desk. And,     next to,  typewriter.  a woman are sitting on the  chair, and  she is   to look at  her pets.    I can see the bed   corner of the room . And    there is a  stereo    near the door.
Yes.
   now I live in Hiroshima.      I live in Hiroshima.  my apartment  has three room.
. But I   joined   very big one-room.
.         when I   enter the step,  I can see the         
. And     I walk into   . I enter the  very big one-room.
   right-hand side,     my bed is in
   and   stereo and  television. .
.
. Just     . . Yes.
.
     I missed  Tokyo   just after  being  transferred to Hiroshima.
But, now,  it is comfortable for me to live in Hiroshima
 because 
   two years ago,   I moved to  Hiroshima.    I was born and grew up in   Suginami Ward in Tokyo  before being  transferred. So  Tokyo's life is  normal for me.  but    Hiroshima is typical countryside city area,      it has a nature and  convenience area. So,    when I buy  necessity    out of shops and restaurant,    it takes me,        no,  ten minutes to get there. .
 it's very  comfortable.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
O K.
Hello.  this is .
 I would like to apologize you   for   next party because    I couldn't        join it   because    I have to prepare to study English to pass S S T.   but,    after next  Sunday,               I can have   enough spare time. So,   could you invite me to next  party?

     no   I seldom go to  party,
because   I have to work  even if    in my  weekends.
 and   we don't have  a lot of friends  in Hiroshima because       we have to work very hard.
Yes.
Yes. .
Yes.
 yes.      the way of  releasing my stress  is   two thing . One thing           to use    aroma candle in my room. When I  get to my  home,    I make fire to  aroma candle, and  I listen   relaxation tapes. . And  the other one is   exercise, but not special exercise, just walk. When I   get to my apartment,       I live in apartment ninth floor,    I used   steps      from  first floor to ninth floor.
It is      adequate   exercise .
.
Yes.
