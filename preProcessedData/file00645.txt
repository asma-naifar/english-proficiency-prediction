That is just one thousand yen.". So my mother thought ". That's very nice. So  I'll make it  for the present.". And she got it    no, no, no,    one thousand yen. And  back to     ground floor,   she found      no, no, no,    no, no, no, what to say,   thirty percent-off shoes.
  she  thinking ". What a nice shoes and very cheap. .   can I buy it or not?".    but   she didn't buy it. And     half way to the station, she found another  dress. . These are fifty percent-off sales.   so fifty percent off. So  she wanna buy it. And that is   more reasonable  compare with  those shoes. So   she  make a   decision to buy  no, no, no, no, two suits.          and she got out of the .
