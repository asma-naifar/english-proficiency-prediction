College? My major is American and English literature and also I'm studying linguistics and intercultural communication.
At the moment?  I'm  reading English literature like,  classic one,   Shakespeare play, and actually I'm reading "Hamlet" which is very difficult to read .
And also I'm reading Jane Austin and George Orwell.
.
My favorite author is,  of course, I like Jane Austin and   Charles Dickens,  also  Shakespeare and in addition, I like reading  poet, so,   sometimes I read T. S. Eliot. 
Free time?  when I have time,  I'm usually listening to C Ds or talking with friends on the phone,   sometimes in person.   actually  I spend most of time for  music like going to concert  or listening to C Ds or shopping at the C D shop.
Last concert?  last concert is    at the end of the last month. I went to the concert of  the band   who is American punk band.
 I was really excited   and   the hall becomes  like a  war  soon after the  band started playing the show.  And  the audience  got crazy and   some of them were like fighting 
.
Yeah, very dangerous. . 
   I'm sorry, I couldn't help fighting 
 with other audience. And sometimes,  some of the audience is  of our head.
Because  they're jumping.
 Yeah. 
Yes.   the last time   I went abroad is this summer. I went to San Francisco to study academic skills in English in  for three weeks. And after that   I went to Vancouver in Canada  to see my best friend  who is now staying at Vancouver to study English in the language college.

Yeah.        this shows   the life of one family.   it's Sunday and     the father is running to get some exercise    because  he gained  weight lately.
  and   the mother is   chatting with neighborhood and the neighborhood is just come back    from the vacation. And they're talking about  the vacation. And     there are two children in this family. And one is a girl who is five or six years old and now she is playing at yard  by herself. And the other one is a boy who is    seven or eight years old and he's now playing with his friend with ball.    and also  there are two dogs  in the house    and they're   relationship and seldom fight and now playing outside.  .  That's it.
 I'm sorry?
 Yeah. Actually,   I don't  have much time to talk with my neighborhood  because    I'm now living in the apartment so sometimes  one family  to other place and soon after that, other family   came in.
City life. I used to like  country life. But I got used to the  city life now because I live in  for more than ten years. So I think     it's gonna a kind of hard to live in countryside now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
O K.
Yeah. Actually,      I bought this one  right now. But    on second thought, I didn't like it, so maybe    can I get this back?
  it's    shirt. 
 but I have a receipt and  I don't open  yet.

 there's no problem. But   I don't like the shirt in yellow and maybe  blue or red one is better. So   I don't want it anymore. .
 thank you but   actually this is for my friend but  the yellow one doesn't  look like on her.
Please.
     maybe but  I want to get it back. Please.
.
Thank you.
 No, as far as I remember.
Shop? . I'm usually shopping at Shibuya,  Marui or Palco or other some shopping  center. But    I haven't  been  shopping lately because I can't afford to  buy anything. 
Yeah.

One to six?    one day last week,    we were thinking about doing something   on the day, but it's rainy outside so we just think    and    something good idea  occurs  to us.     we went to the movies        because  there is good movie in the theater. So  we went there together and got in the theater, we bought some foods like  coke and popcorn    and then just movie started.  The movie  which is kind of action,    actually. I don't like action movie but this one is very good, very exciting and I like it. And     other two people   like this film, too. So    I could say we had a great time  on that day. 
Yes, I like movies. And if I had time,    I go to the movies but now I've been busy with studies and part-time job lately. So,  it's  hard to find to see movies.
Yeah.
