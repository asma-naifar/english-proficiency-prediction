 one day? am I this story as my experience?
So .
 O K? one day last week, I went to the movie with my friends. I went there with two my friends. But I treated them 
so I have to pay six thousand yen. And after we enter the movie theater, they said that they wanted to have
 something to drink and something to eat. But they didn't have enough money so we bought popcorns and drinks. And then, we enjoyed watching movie. that was action movie. a a plane explo in the air. it reminded me of the accidents in United States. but we were happy to see that movie
in the end.
Thank you.
At home? . I prefer seeing video at home to watching movie at movie theater because watching movie at a movie theater will costs me a lot. usually it will cost and five hundred yen. But if I will rent video at rental video shop, it will cost only four hundred yen or so. So that's one reason and while watching or seeing video, I can drink something or I eat something so. yeah, actually seldom movie see video at home.
Tomorrow?

 ? I also have classes tomorrow and I have to go shopping.
Yeah. I have to, 
 I'm going to Korea next week.
