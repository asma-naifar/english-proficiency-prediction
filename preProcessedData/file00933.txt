Hi, <H pn="A's name">XXX01</H>. <F>Urm</F> I'm really sorry to tell you this, but <F>ur</F> I can't go to your dinner party tonight because <.></.> I'm feeling really <F>urr</F> bad right now.<F>Uh-huh</F>. <SC>I <.></.> might have some cold</SC> <R>I</R> I caught a cold from my friend <F>urm</F> someone else. And I have to <.></.> <F>ur</F> stay at home and get sleep.<.></.> <F>Oh</F> I didn't know that. <F>Err</F>. <.></.><OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL> <F>Well</F> <F>urm</F> <.></.> <SC>it's</SC> I really appreciate your <F>ur</F> <.></.> kindness. But <.></.> today is just <F>ur</F> not a good day for me to go to a party. And it's really a bad cold.<nvs>laughter</nvs> <laughter><F>Ohh</F></laughter> <.></.> but I don't think I could make it to your house. <F>Ur</F> I can't even walk or stand up.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Urm</F>.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.But <SC>I can't</SC> <F>ur</F> <.></.> I don't feel like to <R>go out and</R> <.></.> go out and <F>urm</F> <.></.> surrounded by a lot of people. So I guess I'll stay home. I'm really sorry to tell you this. But <F>urm</F> I hope you invite me for the next party.<nvs>laughter</nvs><F>Urrm</F> <.></.> when I get well, <F>er</F> you can. But<OL>I'll</OL> let you know later.I'm sorry.Yeah.<F>Uh-huh</F>. I like parties.<F>Urm</F> <.></.> I don't really know about parties in Japanbecause I only know <F>er</F> parties like <SC><JP>nomikai</JP></SC> drinking party.<F>Um</F> so compare the drinking party in Japan and <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, the biggest difference is <F>ur</F> <.></.> I guess in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, <SC>we don't go to a</SC> <.></.> <SC>we don't</SC> <F>er</F> <.></.> we usually do a party at home.And for example, at my friend's house and he buys a lot of beer <F>ur</F> for us and we pay a little bit to him. But in Japan, I found out that <SC>we bought</SC> <.></.> most of the time we go to <.></.> a drinking place such as <JP>izakaya</JP> ora bar.So when I was in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, we didn't <F>ur</F> <.></.> go to any place to drink. We usually did parties at home.And <SC>I guess</SC> <F>ur</F> I think the reason is that <.></.> <R>in</R> in <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>, they check I D.<R>And</R> and in Japan, they claim that they do but it's a little bit easier on us. <F>Er</F> they don't check the <R>I D</R> I D. <OL><F>Urm</F></OL>.So I guess that's one of the reason.<CO>But</CO>. <F>Urr</F> <..></..> <F>uhmm</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Urm</F> one day last week, <.></.> the couple <.></.> <R>were</R> were walking down the street. And the guy <.></.> heard something. And they found a cat in the box. And the box is <F>urr</F> green, orange, <F>urr</F> navy color. But anyways, <F>urr</F> <SC>she</SC> <.></.> the girl <.></.> took out the cat out of the box and ask the boy <.></.> if they can or if she can take the cat home. And the boy said, "No". But <.></.> she put the <F>ur</F> cat to her coat, <F>uhm</F> begged him to <.></.> take the cat home. So <.></.> the boy first refused but <F>ur</F> <SC>he</SC> they decided to take the cat home. And <F>oh</F> I forgot to say it's the raining day.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Oh</F> I have a dog.It's a beagle,same as Snoopy. <OL><F>Ur</F></OL><F>Urr</F> yes. We bought the dog five years ago.And <SC>the first time was</SC> <F>ur</F> in the beginning is really hard for us because we have to <SC>tell</SC> <F>urr</F> teach the dog a lot of things such as <F>urm</F> the bathroom stuff or <.></.> <SC><?>just</?> <F>ur</F> <.></.> a lot of</SC> <F>ur</F> <.></.> <SC>for</SC> <F>ur</F> taking a dog for a walk.<SC>So</SC> <.></.> but now, <F>urr</F> we taught him a lot of lessons.<OL>And</OL> I guess he learned that. So it's a really fun <F>er</F> to <OL>have a dog</OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Oh</F> <.></.> yeah, I've seen a <.></.> robot dog in the news.<F>Ur</F> <.></.> for me, <F>ur</F> <SC>I wouldn't buy or</SC> <F>urr</F> <.></.> I wouldn't buy those stuff because <.></.> it's sort of like <.></.> getting away from the <R>reality</R> reality.That's how I feel. <F>Ur</F>.But <.></.> for some people, they might feel <.></.> or they might talk to the robot dog like a real dog.<F>Err</F> so <.></.> I think it depends on each of us <R>to treat</R> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> to <.></.> treat the <F>ur</F> robot dog. <F>Ur</F> but for me, I wouldn't buy it. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Ur</F> yes. <F>Ur</F> me and my friends are going to <F>ur</F> actually snowboarding.<R>I</R> I didn't wanna go but <F>ur</F> <.></.> just to fix the number of people,<F>um</F> I have to go with them. <F>Urr</F> <.></.> and my sister's coming back<OL>like</OL> I saidnext January soyes, and I have to find a job first to work during the winter <SC>se</SC> holidays.But I haven't found one right now, soI gotta keep looking at <SC>those</SC> <F>ur</F> one of those magazines.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Urr</F> I'm not sure. I haven't tried it.<F>Ur</F> Thank you.
