Hi.
.
My name is .
.
I live in right now.
 because my parents used to live in 
until last year, but they came back so I I had to live with them.
. Before that, I was living in 
which is really closer to the school.
 I go to 
 but since they came back, it takes about yeah, about one hour to get here.
 with my sister.
.
 my sister goes to .
And I have two sisters. And one of them goes to 
and the other one lives in right now.
She is working at some sort of newspaper company.
 yes. actually January, I went to to visit my sister and my other friends.
 that's the last time I met her. But she is coming back on next January.
So I get to see her soon.
 she is just visiting and she took the break for about three weeks.
 she has time to come back.
And she said she wanted to go to Japan because she hasn't been here for a while.
 and her boyfriend is coming with her.
So I'm gonna have to take them around or show them around 
or any place that's interesting.
.
.
 yes. right now,
which is pretty close to the World Trade Center.
But I called her to see she is O K.
And when she got the phone, she was sleeping. So
 so I was the first one to tell her what happened,
since she was sleeping.
 yes, she was O K.
.
 , eleven.
 I was taking a sort of like a nap.
And my mom woke me up to let me know the tragedy.
So the first, I tried to call her I don't remember the exact time but at that time, but the phone was busy. I guess
everyone in Japan was calling their relatives or
any friends. So I got a little nervous. when it wasn't busy, we talk to her and she was O K. So for me.
.
 the place is at the kids are playing snowball. . and some people are just doing ski and others are doing snowboarding.
And one of the skier is falling. jersey, I'm not sure but maybe he is a coach for these. Maybe it's a ski lesson. there is a snowball right by the it's a ski house, I guess.
Yes. I'm not sure.
 not really.
.
Summer sports? I play basketball and soccer which is all-season sports, so.
 but I play basketball during summer almost every day.
.
Basketball?
 I used to live in 
 was I left for when I was twelve. when I used to live in Japan, I was playing soccer, and not much of basketball.
But when I got to , is such a big basketball country,
 used to basketball stuff.
And not the best player 
 the first year, I made a basketball trial.
And I was on the team and we won the district championship.
. one of my team mate now plays in university of .
And he is pretty popular. he might go N B A .
But anyways, my used to ask me to play basketball at his house.
And that's how I got make a lot of friends through the basketball stuff. 
 it was a natural thing for me to
play basketball.
.
Hi. .
. Hi, . I'm really sorry to tell you this, but I can't go to your dinner party tonight because bad right now.
. might have some cold I caught a cold from my friend someone else. And I have to stay at home and get sleep.
 I didn't know that. . 
 I really appreciate your today is just not a good day for me to go to a party. And it's really a bad cold.
 but I don't think I could make it to your house. I can't even walk or stand up.
.

.
.
But I hope you invite me for the next party.

 you can. But
 let you know later.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
. I like parties.
 I don't really know about parties in Japan
because I only know parties like drinking party.
 so compare the drinking party in Japan and , the biggest difference is , we usually do a party at home.
And for example, at my friend's house and he buys a lot of beer for us and we pay a little bit to him. But in Japan, I found out that a drinking place such as or
a bar.
So when I was in , we didn't go to any place to drink. We usually did parties at home.
And I think the reason is that in , they check I D.
 and in Japan, they claim that they do but it's a little bit easier on us. they don't check the I D. .
So I guess that's one of the reason.
. .
.
 one day last week, were walking down the street. And the guy green, orange, navy color. But anyways, took out the cat out of the box and ask the boy she put the cat to her coat, begged him to the boy first refused but they decided to take the cat home. And I forgot to say it's the raining day.

 I have a dog.
It's a beagle,
same as Snoopy. 
 yes. We bought the dog five years ago.
And in the beginning is really hard for us because we have to teach the dog a lot of things such as the bathroom stuff or taking a dog for a walk.
 we taught him a lot of lessons.
 I guess he learned that. So it's a really fun to .
.
 robot dog in the news.
 it's sort of like reality.
That's how I feel. .
But or they might talk to the robot dog like a real dog.
 so to robot dog. but for me, I wouldn't buy it. 
.
 yes. me and my friends are going to actually snowboarding.
 I didn't wanna go but just to fix the number of people,
 I have to go with them. and my sister's coming back
 I said
next January so
yes, and I have to find a job first to work during the winter holidays.
But I haven't found one right now, so
I gotta keep looking at one of those magazines.
.
 I'm not sure. I haven't tried it.
 Thank you.
