Good afternoon.<F>Er</F> my name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.Sure.Fine, thank you.I live in <H pn="others1">XXX03</H>.<H pn="others1">XXX03</H>. <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> is the city <F>um</F> along <H pn="others2">XXX04</H> Line, around twenty minutes from <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>.Yes.<F>Um</F> I live with my parents, younger brother and elder sister.<F>Mhm</F> <nvs>laughter</nvs> actually, my brother is preparing for the entrance examination to enter college.<F>Mhm</F> since I'm now senior student, so I come to school <R>only</R> only two or three days in a week.<F>Ah</F> I didn't do job-hunting.<F>Um</F> <SC>so</SC> <F>uhm</F> <.></.> <F>uhmm</F> <laughter>but</laughter> I have not decided about my future plan, yet. <F>Mhm</F> <?>but</?> <F>mhm</F> I hope to study in U K <F>mhm</F> <R>to</R> to take <SC>M A course</SC> M A programme in peace studies.<?>Yes</?>.<F>Urr</F> I want to study <R>pe</R> peace studies, <F>eh</F> especially putting an emphasis on <F>mhm</F> conflict resolution, <F>urm</F> <F>mhm</F> ethnic or racial conflicts. <F>Mhmm</F> first of all, I can speak only Japanese and English, so <F>uhmm</F> I was trying to search Japanese <SC?>yu</SC?> graduate school <F>urr</F> where I can undertake <?>an</?> research about that area, but I couldn't find. <F>Mhm</F> it's <R>a</R> <SC?>a bits</SC?> <F>uhm</F> unfamiliar area here in Japan. So then, I consider <F>urr</F> <??></??> studying abroad, <SC>and</SC> <.></.> <F>uhm</F> of course, I also <SC>think</SC> thought about studying in <SC>U</SC> <F>uhm</F> the United States. But, I felt <F>uhm</F> <.></.> <F>urmm</F> in the United States, <F>mhm</F> the peace study is <F>mhm</F> too much related to <R>the</R> <F>urr</F> the <SC>government</SC> <SC>government's</SC> no, diplomatic policy. <R>So</R> so I decided to choose the U K as a place to study.<F>Uhmm</F> because I have two problems. One is, of course, <SC>finance</SC> finances, and the other is my English is not enough for studying there. <SC>So</SC> and also since now I'm major in law, and law is not directly related to the peace studies, so <R>I th</R> I think I have to study about that area before entering graduate school. So now, <F>mhm</F> the most possible plan after graduate next March will be <F>mhm</F> <.></.> continuing the current part-time jobs and studying by myself.<F>Urr</F> I have two kinds of part-time jobs. One is a tutor. I tutor a high school boy <F>mhm</F> once or twice in a week, and also I work in the office of a small <R>trade</R> trade company in <H pn="others4">XXX07</H>. I work there on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays from <laughter><R>the morning to</R></laughter> the morning to the evening.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.<F>Mhm</F>. <.></.> A girl is sitting on the chair <.></.> <SC>indicating the</SC> indicating a computer. <F>Uhmm</F>. <.></.> <?>But</?>, I suppose she is looking at the cat which is sleeping in the bed. <..></..> There is a dog, too. Dog is also sleeping <.></.> on the floor. <.></.> <F>Uhm</F> the door is open, <..></..> although <F>mhm</F> from the clothes of the girl, I can suppose it's winter. <F>Mhm</F> and <.></.> it's nine o'clock, <F>mhm</F> <SC>but</SC> and June. <F>Mhm</F> on the desk, <.></.> there are a computer and typewriter and some pieces of paper. <..></..> <F>Uhm</F> except for <SC>bed</SC> a bed and a desk, there is <..></..> <F>urr</F> a set of <.></.> audio player in the room.<OL>Yes</OL>. Yes.<F>Mhm</F> <SC>I</SC> <F>mhm</F> every night, I <.></.> spend <F>mhm</F> about two hours in checking and sending e-mails. <?>Yes</?>. <F>Uhm</F> <SC>it's</SC> now, <SC>it's my</SC> <F>mhm</F> it's <SC?>a</SC?> <laughter><R>my</R></laughter> my best hobby.Yeah.<F>Uhmm</F>. No, because <R>I ha</R> I have a lot of friends on the net already. So, <F>mhm</F> <.></.> I am keeping in touch with friends from the English school in Tronto, Canada, <SC>there</SC> where I studied, for a month, in <SC>last Sunday</SC> <F>er</F> <?>sorry</?>, last summer, and also from the summer school I participated in this summer.Yes.<OL>Yes</OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<?>Yes</?>.<F>Ah</F> yes, thank you. I'm <F>er</F> looking for something for souvenirs for my family in the United States. <F>Uhmm</F> actually, I don't have any idea. Could you give me some advice?<F>Um</F>.Japanese food? Do you have Japanese food here?<F>Uh-huh</F>.

I'll buy it.Thank you.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uhmm</F>. Not here, but in foreign countries.For example? I've been to India, you know, <R>I</R> <F>mhm</F> I knew <F>uhmm</F> they gave me very very <SC>high</SC> expensive prices, so I try <F>uhm</F> to bargain, and I try to get <F>uhmm</F> less than half of <?>that</?> prices, so and I succeeded. Maybe, you know, the half prices were still very good for them.<F>Uhmm</F>. First of all, <R>I</R> <.></.> I don't want <R>to</R> <.></.> to do shopping, you know, only with <R>Japanese</R> Japanese <SC>be</SC> since <F>uhm</F> <F>uhm</F> Japanese people are tend to be <F>mhm</F> deceived, so maybe <R>you should</R> you should ask <F>mm</F> <SC>the local</SC> <F>uhm</F> your friends who are native in that country <R>to</R> <F>uhm</F> to <R>acco</R> accompany with you.<OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.One day last week, <..></..> <F>urr</F> a housewife found there were nothing to eat in the refrigerator, so she decided to go to a supermarket to buy something for the dinner. She went there by a car, <.></.> and after entering the store, <F>uhm</F> she picked up some foods <F>uhm</F> for example, meat, bread and so on, and then went back to her car, <.></.> and <.></.> went back home. <..></..> And then, she started to cook <.></.> for the dinner.<F>Uhmmm</F>. <.></.> <laughter>Not</laughter> very much.<OL><F>Uh-huh</F></OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.<F>Uhmm</F>, <.></.> you know, I live with my family, and <F>mhm</F> I and my elder sister are student, <F>mhm</F> and my father <SC>i</SC> <SC>work</SC> <F>er</F> works out. So, <R>my</R> my mother always try to prepare <SC>something</SC> you know, something for us to eat at anytime, so I don't have to <F>mhm</F> cook <SC>by our</SC> by myself. It's nice.<F>Urr</F> <F>uhm</F> yes, but <R>she</R> <F>mhm</F> she has to do so because we families cannot meet together for dinner or lunch, <OL><F>mhm</F></OL>because the time to go home are so different<OL>from each other</OL>.<OL><?>Thank you very much</?></OL>.<F>Uh-huh</F>.Thank you very much.<F>Urr</F> I will attend the last class of my seminar <OL>this year</OL>.Thank you very much.
