<F>Uh</F>. My name is <H pn="B's name">XXX02</H>.<OL>Nice to meet you</OL>.Yeah, sure.<F>Uh</F>. My hometown is in <F>um</F> <H pn="others1">XXX03</H> in <F>uh</F> <H pn="others2">XXX04</H>.<F>Mm</F>.<SC?>Place <R>just</R> just like</SC?> <F>ur</F> <F>um</F> <SC>it's very</SC> <F>um</F> I think I like it very much. <F>Um</F>. It's very <?>roar</?>, but <F>uh</F> it surrounded by <F>uh</F> nice mountains and river. And <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> it's very you know, <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> relaxing town. <SC>I've been si</SC> <F>uh</F> I've been here <F>um</F> since <SC>I</SC> you know, I got married. So I've been in there for seven or eight years. <F>Hum</F>. I like <SC>it</SC> this town very very much. <F>Uhm</F>. And also it's very close to Tokyo. <F>Hum</F>. Some of the people <F>uh</F> say that "<F>Oh</F> it's very far.". But I don't think so because if you can get on the <F>uum</F> bullet train, <F>uh</F> so it's very easier to access to the central Tokyo, of course down here in the <H pn="others3">XXX05</H>. So <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> it's very convenient. So that's why I like it very much.My wife? <F>Hum</F>. <SC>My wife</SC> <F>uh</F> <F>uhm</F> <F>hum</F> she has been <R>a</R> a little bit <F>er</F> ill for the past two or three weeks. <F>Uhm</F>. But <F>uh</F> we don't know the exactly why she's been ill because <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> even if she consulted some doctors, and also got the medical check, but <F>uh</F> <F>hum</F> no clear reason <F>eh</F> <SC>ca</SC> came out. So that <F>uh</F> now, <F>uh</F> <F>mm</F> <SC>he is go</SC> <F>ur</F> <R>she</R> she is going to see <F>uh</F> not you know, <F>ur</F> western way, <F>um</F> but <F>ur</F> you know, oriental way. So that <F>ur</F> I hope she will recover from that situation as soon as possible. <F>Hum</F>. One of my <?>fear</?> is that <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> sometimes my <F>ur</F> mother <F>ehm</F> visits us <F>mm</F> to see my children <F>er</F> <?>which</?> just seven years old, and also just four years. So I think this is <F>uh</F> kind of <?>irritate</?> to her. <F>Hum</F>. So sometime I ask my mother <SC>to</SC> not to visit <SC>he</SC> <F>uh</F> my house so often. So <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> <SC>never know that</SC> I don't know <SC>is <SC>the</SC> she will</SC> <F>ur</F> when she will <F>eh</F> good in condition or not. <F>Hum</F> <F>hum</F> But situation is not so bad. So yeah, she must be very optimistic, <F>hum</F> I think.<F>Uh</F>. Now I am <F>ur</F> interested in research <F>ur</F> concerned with <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> you know, <R>En</R> English education. <F>Uhm</F>. What I'm interested in <F>er</F> recent day is the testing <F>ur</F> just like here. But not speaking. <SC>That's the</SC> I'm interested in listening comprehension test. So <F>hum</F> I'm very busy you know, making up a research paper to be submitted to some <F>mm</F> organizations or publisher. So <F>hum</F> I'm very busy. <SC>But</SC> and also of course I have a work. So <SC>the</SC> I have to <F>mm</F> care about the club activity. Now I belong to <JP>kendo</JP> club, and sometimes <F>ur</F> practiced <JP>kendo</JP> together with students by myself. <F>Um</F>. But it's very fun. <F>um</F> So <F>mm</F> I'm busy, but I'm very very satisfied with current life <?>style</?>.<F>Mm</F>.Why? Why? <F>Um</F>. It's very long time. When I was <F>uh</F> maybe seven or eight years old, I learn drawing. But I wanted to stop it because <F>uh</F> I don't like it so much. <?>Then</?> I asked my mother and my father. So they said "So you can stop drawing, but <F>uh</F> you have to start other thing instead of that.". So that <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> fortunately my <F>uh</F> younger brother was going to start <JP>kendo</JP>. So <F>mm</F> I joined him. <F>Hum</F>. That's <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> the first experience I started <JP>kendo</JP>. <F>Hum</F>.<OL><R>Can I</R></OL> can I drink of that?Yeah.<F>Um</F>. <..></..> <F>Ur</F>. She is sitting on the chair just in front of <SC>the</SC> <F>uh</F> her personal computers. <F>Um</F>. But <F>uh</F> <nvs>cough</nvs> <R>she</R> she found that <SC>the</SC> <F>um</F> some interesting T V program <F>um</F> is on the air from the television in her room. So that now she just stopped <F>ehm</F> <F>um</F> you know, typing or something <F>um</F> in front of personal computer. <F>Um</F>. And <F>uh</F> a cat is sleeping on the bed. And a dog is <SC>sleeping on the</SC>, maybe sleeping, but I'm not sure, on the floor. <F>Hum</F>. And the door is open. <F>Hum</F>. And she is also using <F>uhm</F> old-fashioned typewriter. <F>hum</F>. <CO>So</CO>. <F>Mm</F>.Yes, <OL>I do</OL>.<F>Ahh</F>. That's a good question. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Um</F>. Now first of all, <F>uh</F> it's <SC>more</SC> much much more easier going to contact with <F>um</F> <SC>especially</SC> <F>uh</F> friends especially who are in the foreign countries. And <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> particularly, <F>uh</F> sometimes I have to have my research paper <F>um</F> proof-read, by, <F>uh</F> you know, <F>uh</F> foreigners or <R>who</R> <R>who</R> who <?>must be</?> interested in my research. And of course, he or she has to <F>eh</F> have <??></??> in <F>mm</F> higher <F>um</F> level of <F>uh</F> English or skills in the <?>area</?>. <F>Ur</F> But <F>uh</F> a long time ago, <F>uhm</F> when we <SC>do not</SC> did not have personal computers, <F>ur</F> I have to go to the post office, <R>and</R> and say "Please <F>uh</F> <F>uh</F> send this mail to <F>um</F> England or United States, but <?>express on some</?>.". So it you know, <SC>take</SC> took about one or ten days. And then <F>um</F> <SC>back to</SC> back and forth. So it really took me <F>uh</F> much much time. But now for example, in case of <F>um</F> Britain, <F>uh</F> just before sleeping to my bed, I send my e-mail with the <F>ur</F> <?>attached</?> <F>uh</F> to the England. So and <R>the</R> <SC>the day after</SC> <F>uh</F> you know, <SC>the day</SC> the next morning, <F>uh</F> I just found the e-mail is already coming back. So I was very <??></??>. I was very happy to see that. <CO>So</CO>. <F>Mm</F>.It's very convenient.<.></.> Am I have to read?In Japanese?<F>Uh</F>.<JP>Anata wa kaigai ryokou wo keikaku shiteimasuga bashotou shousai wo kimeteimasen</JP>. <JP>Shikenkan wa ryokou dairiten no shain desu</JP>. <F>Er</F>. <JP>Ikisaki wo kimerutameni shikenkan kara arayuru joho wo etekudasai</JP><F>Hum</F> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F> Yes. I'm ready.<F>Uhm</F> <F>um</F> <.></.> <F>uh</F> This says the destination is not decided, yet.Anywhere.<F>Um</F>. But I'm thinking that <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> <F>um</F> even if I do not have any destination in mind, I'll never go to travel agency.<CO>So <OL>that</OL></CO>.<F>Uh</F>. It's a role-play.<F>Um</F>.<F>Um</F>. I'd like to go to <.></.> <F>um</F> <..></..> <F>um</F> <R>bea</R> <R>beach resort</R> beach resort to relax myself.<F>Mm</F>. So do you have any place to be recommended to mein the next winter season,<F>Uh</F> I mean the during this winter vacation?<F>Uh</F>. Guam. <F>Ah</F> I'm afraid <SC>that</SC> the, you know, terrorism. <F>Uh</F> because of terrorism in <SC>New York</SC> Manhattan, <F>uhm</F> Guam is very dangerous place because it's you know, a part of America. So could you show me another <F>uh</F> place <F>um</F> instead of the part of United States?Bali? <F>Uhm</F>. Bali sounds nice. <F>Uhm</F>. But I don't like it so much flight. I guess <F>ah</F> it takes about ten hours from Narita to Jakarta or <R>som</R> something. So could you show me <SC>short</SC> <F>uhm</F> places in which <F>uh</F> we can easily access? <F>Hum</F>.Domestic. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>Domestic area.<F>Hum</F>. But I don't want to be seen by Japanese so <.></.> <F>uh</F> I hope the overseas. <F>Uhm</F>. Could you show me another place?<F>Ah</F>. Cebu Island.The Cebu, I think there's also dangerous because of <F>ur</F> you know, <F>mm</F> <R>I have</R> I have heard that there is <F>uhm</F> kind of <R>terro</R> terrorist <F>hum</F> <R>such as</R> <F>uh</F> such as Al Quaida. So I've heard that the Ministry of Foreign <F>uh</F> warned that we Japanese should refrain from travel in Philippine.<CO>So</CO>.<laughter><?>There are risks</?></laughter> everywhere. But the risk is much much higher in Cebu. <CO>So</CO>.<F>Ah</F>. I got idea. How about <SC>Thai or</SC> Thailand <F>urr</F> <?>or</?> Malaysia? <F>uh</F><F>Uhm</F>.O K.<OL>Thank you very much</OL>.<F>Uh</F>. Thank you.Yeah. <R>If I</R> <CO>if I</CO>.<F>Uh</F>. Usually. <F>Uh</F>. What I mean that <F>uh</F> I never go to travel agency <F>mm</F> before. I decide the destination.Of course, I go sometimes travel agency. <CO><OL>And</OL></CO>.Usually plan. How. <F>Um</F>. Basically I like it individual <R>tour</R> touring in these days. But <F>uh</F> now I'm getting older and older, sometimes <F>uh</F> I feel irritating or annoying. For example, just imagine that <F>uh</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>you get up on the airplane</SC> you get up on <SC>the air</SC> fly on the airplane in the foreign countries, and you haven't decided yet anything, where to stay, <SC>where to</SC> <F>uhm</F> <R>how to buy something</R> how to buy a something. So at this point, we have to decide where to stay <SC>in this</SC> tonight, how to go there. So <R>some</R> sometimes I feel <F>mm</F> <SC>it's very very</SC> it's a little bit <F>um</F> annoying things in these days.So group tour is much more easier.<F>Uhm</F>.<F>Uhm</F>.<F>Uhh</F> <F>hum</F> <F>hum</F><F>Um</F>. <F>Mm</F>? <SC>What do you</SC> for one day last week?<F>Uh-huh</F> <F>huh</F> <F>huh</F> I see. <SC>How many minutes am I</SC> <F>ur</F> <OL><?>how many minutes</?></OL><.></.> <F>Hum</F>. <F>Um</F>. One day, <F>er</F> <SC>two boys and one</SC> <F>mm</F> not boys, two men and one woman <F>uhm</F> <.></.> visited theater <F>uh</F> to see a movie. And before <SC>see</SC> watching the movie, they got <F>uh</F> <F>uhh</F> two or three cups of juice and maybe snacks including popcorns or something. And then as cinema started, they enjoy watching the cinema, <F>uhm</F> eating snacks and drinking a juice. And the cinema was <F>uh</F> maybe about <F>uh</F> <F>um</F> maybe <SC>action</SC> <F>um</F> kind of action films. So <SC>the</SC> a airplane crashed <F>um</F> into green field <F>ur</F> for some reason. And <F>uh</F> <.></.> <F>hum</F> they were very refreshed <F>um</F> at the watching the movie.<F>Hum</F>. <OL><CO>So</CO></OL>.Yeah. <OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Uh</F>. Just a little bit.
