Yes. My name is .
I'm a little nervous, as you know. 
But I'm fine. .
Not really.
. But, in private, I am pretty busy. Because, since this April,
I started to study interpretation.
And it's so demanding.
.
Yes, .
. Yes. . I have two classes a week.
And, at one class, I study interpretation from English to Japanese.
And, at another class,
I study vice versa.
.
 
I can be a good interpreter
or not.
 . At this company, my main job is translation. 
sometimes, I am ,
asked to do interpretation job. 
interpretation is completely different from translation.
And I'm at a loss how to do it.
So that's why I decided to start it.
 it's so interesting.
. I have decided yet whether to stay this company and do more interpretation job 
to leave here and to seek another opportunity.
No. Not yet. .
Not really.
Yes, .
To the United States twice 
 twice .
I walked a lot. You know, the Lake District?
It's famous area 
 Beatrix Potter?
, very beautiful sceneries, 
beautiful places.
I like to walk.
.
All right. . In this room, a woman is sitting in front of a desk. On the desk, there is a personal computer, typewriter, mouse and some sheets of paper. on her bed, there is a cat sleeping. And, besides the bed, a dog seems to be sleeping, too. And there is audio system in her room. And it is June now. And is open. . and it is nine o'clock.
That's all.
. Yes. . Actually, I don't have my .

room
 is Japanese-style room. . But her room, it seems to be western-style room. And I don't have bed. Instead, I have some sets of futon mat
in my closet.
And I have a computer but not desktop type. But mine is notebook type.
And I don't have a typewriter.
And her room seems to be larger than mine.

And there are more books in my room .
.
. of course, it is not so good. But I don't think it is only computer that cause the situation.
Because, without computers, I don't think they are willing to communicate with their parents.

It is not only a matter of computer.
. because it's caused by changing the society, I guess.
Yes.
Yes. I understand .
Yes.
.
