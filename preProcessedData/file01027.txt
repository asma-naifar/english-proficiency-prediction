My husband birthday will come soon, so I decided to buy that tie   the day. And I paid and   shopkeeper give  to me. Then I went up to the next floor. I found  good shoes for sale. So I thought    I should buy now or I shouldn't buy. But  it was still expensive for me. So I decided not to buy. And a next floor, it mean on the third floor, it was for the woman's casual wear. And I found a good shirt. Maybe   it would be suitable for me. And I tried on. But  it was still  not good for me. It mean a just too tight for me. So I just gave up to buy.    sorry,  I decide to buy. Because    maybe I could be able to lose my weight until the next winter. So  I bought   and then I you know, I had  many of  bags and more   it was enough for me. And I was satisfied to feel   enjoyment of the shopping.
