 I don't have to walk to one shop to one shop. There are many shops in the department store from ladies to men. And also foods or anything. Anything are in the department store.
But I have a off card. point card and off card can be used in the department store. and comparing to the small shop, I don't see any difference in price. but in department store, by using the cards, we can get points, or we can get the discount. .

 But that's not a credit card.
