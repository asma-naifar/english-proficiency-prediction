.
Yes,  my name is .
I'm pretty good. But little bit sleepy, because I woke up really earlier than as usual.
Why? Because I have    so many things to do this morning.
That's why.
Like   asking somebody to  check the voucher.
, I'm working for  Department and  by now, it's  closing season.
And   that's a pretty tough.
I just slept only three hours yesterday.
.
Yes.
How about you?

 you mean my current home, or 
hoemtown? O K.  I'm living in .  nearest station is .
That a  Line.
But, my hometown is .
 a little bit far from Tokyo.
In ?
 my  hometown is in .
. That's ski resort .
There are many ski place and  lots of snow.
About two or three years ago.
 start to work  since nineteen ninety-eight
of April.  And  before that, I was studying in college,  but not in , but actually  abroad
for  four year.
 I was studying in United States.
And  my  university was located in West Virginia.
That's near Pittsburgh. Have you heard Pittsburgh?
That's a iron city.
States? Actually, my weakest point was English in high school age.
And  I thought that if I could speak English, it'll be better for me, or best for me to  communicate with somebody like  foreigners.
And  that'll be my  strongest point
 seeking job or finding  my way, future goals, something like this. 
 actually my parents let me go.
And because my parents always said that  I should know another world, like not only in Japan
to see everywhere and study many things and  that'll be very useful for me.
Then, I decided to go.
Free time?  usually, I go to gym.
 Or playing tennis, or shopping.
I usually don't stay home at all.
Why? I don't know. I just feel that  I'm wasting time.   I feel that I must do something.
Like  going school to study about  international accounting
 go to English conversation school. And  study or.
Gym?  I always use a running machine.
Because I want to have more stamina to  playing tennis.
I don't have a  stamina to play games.
  because  once,   when I play the game, a tournament game,   I didn't have any energy after that. And  I, of course, lost.
 That was  so terrible.
  actually I was winning, but, 
     after that one period, I lost any 
and I couldn't move.

 little bit different. Because  the place that I stay in United States was a  of course country side, but  there are many  farmer people.
And  no man  jogging and  
no one chatting. They just   
cultivating the
. And yeah, little bit different.
 there are many big people, actually, fat people in West Virginia. I don't know why.

Yeah, I did.
Yeah, in the States. Actually, when I went to the States, just I went to States, I had a two hundred pounds.     like  ninety-two kilograms. But 
 I came back
I lost      forty or fifty pounds, like twenty-five kilograms.
I don't know why. I just joined the tennis team. And  I played   hard. Maybe, just because of that.
And  I couldn't find any reason .
