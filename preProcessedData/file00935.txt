Story?
O K. . department store for buying my husband's birthday present. Then I went there. Then at there, they had a really nice tie. So I bought it. I hope my husband likes it. And yeah, it was on the way to home, at the lady's section, bargain you know, I found they are having a bargain then. It was thirty percent off from regular price. So I look for some nice shoes I bought the also bought the which was fifty percent off. So I bought it without carefully thinking because it's half price. Then I got out of department shop. as a result, I than got for my husband. 
.
What I consider? you know, you know, he or she would be pleased, I mean be happy to have it.
 buying clothes or shirts, I think. Because, food. , you know, yeah, I think food has less problem. you know, like shirts or dress or like clothing stuff, you know, the size
 problem. Sometimes doesn't fit. So I heard that Americans gave present like when they buy dresses or clothes for somebody,
they put the receipt with present, I heard.
 that the person who got present, if the present doesn't fit the they can switch
the present most of time, receipt shows the price.
 I do not do that way.
 yeah, yesterday was my friend's birthday.
And I was thinking to buy something for her. I looking for I couldn't have time to would be the day I buy .
