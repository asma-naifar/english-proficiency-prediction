Last night, we had a press conference on the new product.    we introduced our new product in spring to press people, editors. And we had a small party after that.
So  I drunk some .
Party. . We planned  to have a press conference.  we started the preparation  in November last year. And  we have a new product this year  named .
. Which is   skin lightening products for  eyes.
And then,  that is the fifth products from . And  we introduced it to the  editors by  explaining  the background and the technology and the benefit  efficacy, etcetera. And after that, we had a  standing-style  small party,
with editor. And we changed the name cards  to  introduce myself. And we ask them to pick the Eye Stick into their magazines.
Yeah.
. .
  
. In the weekend, I    usually  read books or  the watching video, movies, listening music, not going out     weekdays,  I'm very busy and  sometimes   I have to be in the office until ten o'clock or eleven o'clock. So  terrible.  I need a time to sleep and relax in the weekend. So  just doing small things, reading books or something. And also, I have to do the some house  hold things, laundry,  . Because I am a .
. That's my .
I want to try but no time. And also  if I have time  after the work or  in the weekend, I prefer just being relax. .
.    anything is ?
. . He was an employee  three years ago. But he is trying to do something by himself. . And now, he is trying to   run a restaurant or  to work for a estate or something. So he is trying  do 
 any business   to build up  his own company.
  and he is   very kind and warm person. And very   relaxing person,  think.
. I'm a little bit sensitive. And I sometimes  give him  some irritating .
But he is always . That's very,
nice for me.
, yes, I'm very happy to go  home.
Because I'm very  relax when I meet him. 
. Because he was in a  beverage company as a  development person. And  that was very nice work for him. And he enjoyed the work  very much for three years. But that became some routine work. So  he was tired of the   routine work. So he wanted to try something. 
.
.  it is a  school class. And   the students are taking a mathematics class. And the teacher is a woman. .  she is explaining   some graph to students. And  only one student are listening to her class very hard. But the others  are doing  anything they want to do. And  some of them are   two girl  beside the window are talking together. And   a girl  in the first line is, maybe making a mail to her friend. And one person is drinking beverage and listening to some music. . So    I don't think it's a very usual atmosphere at  .
  it is not the same as I took in  high school .
. .
. Yes. . My high school was  a kind of,  how can I express it,  very  high class. .    high scho we had to study very hard  for entering university. So the classes are distinguished  by  study levels. . So the classes  were   very   strict atmosphere and a kind of strange, 
. It was not strange  when I was in high school. But  yeah. Yes, remembering it, it's a little bit strange. Everybody in the classroom   was studying so hard. Very quiet.
Yeah.
.   because  these people and the class  are not interested in mathematics. And mathematics is not  necessary for their life, they think.
So.     they are  enjoying their time by themselves. And   I think  that time now   is only  interesting thing for them. Not for the future or  so they don't have some future plan or future  vision now. .
. Yes.
 Yes. . .

Yes. So sometimes I go Seibu, Tobu  .
Every department store.
. Because there are so many cheap shops and also some department stores. I think there are so  many kinds of shops and restaurants. And the for young people, it's very   convenient   from the point of view of    .
And the place.   yes, I  so. And  the atmosphere itself is very casual.
So it's very good    especially for young people.
.

One day last week?
. . O K. . One day last week,    a girl was walking on the street with her boyfriend. And        sorry,  her boyfriend caught some sounds, mew, mew. 
  but she didn't notice the sound because of the rain. And he said that         something is saying something.  And   they found a  kitten in the box. And  she is so happy to find him. .     nobody owned the cat. So she wanted to  have it. And she asked her boyfriend to take him to their house. Because they live together. But the boyfriend rejected it at first. But she was trying to ask him to have it many times. "Please. Please. Please.".
   the boyfriend finally agreed to take him. And  they  took the  kitten in the box. And walk away to their house,
together.

 if it  is a cat, I cannot  I prefer dogs.

when I was  ten years old.
And it was so surprising and exciting thing.  yes, if I find some dog, I'll take .
