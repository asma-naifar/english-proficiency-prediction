However my neighborhood is the very much <F>ur</F> <JP>shitamachi</JP> like old type of Japanese <F>ur</F> so called <JP>shoutengai</JP>. The shops are still around, and everybody is still friendly in my neighborhood.<laughter>Yeah</laughter>.Yes.

I sometimes go out, and drink with her <?>around</?> my neighborhood,at <JP>shitamachi</JP> restaurant. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Ohh</F> Last time we went <R>was</R> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> was <?>about</?> April.That was <F>ur</F> when I <F>um</F> entered the graduate school, <R>and</R> and she treated me with toast. <laughter>And</laughter> we ate <F>ur</F> over <F>ur</F> couple of <F>ur</F> alcohol maybe <JP>yakitoriya</JP> and so forth.That's right. I'm majoring in <??></??> linguistics.<F>Urm</F> Actually I <F>urm</F> <F>ur</F> was <F>ee</F> <F>ur</F> interested in <F>ur</F> like <F>um</F> <SC>language learning of</SC> <F>ur</F> human beings learn language and how the mechanism in your brain is working. But <F>urm</F> actually I graduated, and I worked first couple of years at advertising company. And then I came back to graduate school.Hobbies? <F>Ur</F> <F>well</F> I like <F>urr</F> singing.Actually I used to join at the chorus. <nvs>laughter</nvs> So <F>ur</F> I <F>urm</F> sing alone <F>ur</F> over playing piano <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>em</F> like musical songs and opera songs.That's my hobby. <nvs>laughter</nvs>No, not anymore. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>I have been a member but my friends are already <??></??> working. So not anymore.<F>Urr</F> I <SC?>like the</SC?> like <F>ur</F> <??></??> music or like <F>ur</F> <??></??> stories, those kind of songs.At home. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>No. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>They're all <JP>shitamachian</JP>, so <OL><?>I don't</?> care about it</OL>.O K. <SC>This</SC> <F>ur</F> it's a class of math. And a female teacher is <F>ur</F> explaining about the functions with her textbook in her hand. And some students are listening to the class eagerly while others are listening <F>ur</F> to the radio, or <F>ur</F> chewing the gum, or also chatting. <F>err</F> <F>umm</F> <.></.> <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL>O K. <F>Mm-hm</F>.<F>Urm</F>. <F>Urr</F> I used to go to <F>ur</F> girls' high school. So there were no boys, only girls. <F>Ur</F>. However the atmosphere of class room is somewhat similar. <F>Urm</F>. Some students were eager. <F>Ur</F>. On the other hand, some were <F>ur</F> playing <F>er</F> pokily like me. <nvs>laughter</nvs> Yes. Yes.<OL>Yes</OL>. <F>Um</F>. We were <F>ur</F> not supposed to wear <F>ur</F> like <F>ur</F> the colored socks. Or those who had a long hair have to <F>urm</F> have <OL><??></??></OL>.<F>Uhh</F>. But <F>um</F> as long as <SC>their</SC> <F>er</F> <F>er</F> <F>ur</F> <SC>they have</SC> teachers or school have the reason to force them, and as long as the students are convinced that it's necessary to follow those rules, I think those rules are <F>um</F> <F>mm</F> quite <F>ur</F> meaningful. But those wearing no colored socks or <laughter><??></??></laughter>, we <?>couldn't</?> understand why. So I think <F>urm</F> <??></??> just <F>um</F> force <F>um</F> to wear them without reason. I don't think those are convincing <??></??>, not meaningful.<F>Oh</F> School uniform. <SC>I</SC> <F>mm</F> <F>well</F> when I was in high school, <F>um</F> <SC>I don't</SC> I didn't like them. But <F>um</F> now I feel it's quite O K. Because <F>um</F> <SC>it</SC> <F>eu</F> it's economical. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><SC>You're</SC> <F>urm</F> <?>just by</?> yourself, <F>urm</F> <SC>I also</SC> <F>um</F> <SC>the uniform</SC> <F>uh</F> I think that <F>ur</F> things you wear also makes one's mind. When I used to work, <F>ur</F> I wear cosmetics, and also wear suits. And even if I'm very tired, <??></??> once I <F>um</F> wear suits <SC>I have to</SC> like my mind get very <F>um</F> kind of <?>straight up</?> <??></??>. So <SC>the</SC> <SC>those</SC> every one have the same in fact.O K.<F>Urm</F>. About <F>urm</F> <SC>this</SC> <F>ur</F> <F>ur</F> <F>um</F> <SC>the</SC> <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>ur</F> this notebook I bought yesterday, <F>urm</F> I thought I could exchange this into the other color. Is that possible?<F>Well</F> <SC>if</SC> <F>urr</F> but yeah, as long as <SC>the</SC> <F>urm</F> <?>the color</?>, <F>um</F> price is same, I think it's <F>urr</F> allowed. <??></??> <SC>How does that sound</SC>, I mean how is it?<F>Well</F> there is <F>well</F> other blue notebooks. And there are a lot, and see they're just <F>ur</F> same price. <SC>It's</SC> all you have to do is just exchange. <OL><nvs>laughter</nvs></OL><F>Well</F> <SC>I just</SC> <F>urm</F> <F>well</F> when I see that on the light over there, see the light here is <R>bright</R> bright. <SC>After</SC> when I saw it in <R>the</R> <F>urm</F> the sun light, <SC>the</SC> it's not just as bright as I thought. And I don't like this <F>urr</F> <F>urr</F> <F>urrm</F> you know, <??></??> yellow. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <R>I</R> I want more bright color.No, no, no.

"<F>Oh</F>. This is the notebook I'm going to write, <F>oh</F> no, I don't want to open it.". Or <F>ur</F> the bright color, "Yes, this is the one. See I feel very <F>ur</F> good to study.". <SC>The</SC> it's the very <SC>good</SC> big difference for me. Just it's <laughter>right there</laughter>.<F>Ohh</F>.

We had <F>ur</F> <?>ordered</?> the things such as <F>ur</F> tents and backpack and the <F>ur</F> food and the all sorts of things for camps. And when we got to the mountains, we built our tent <F>ur</F> by the river. And we were preparing our supper. Then it started raining. And we thought it was <F>ur</F> not serious <F>ur</F> so <F>ur</F> <R>we didn't</R> <F>ur</F> we didn't take it seriously. However, it became very windy, and <SC>the storm</SC> <F>ur</F> was like a storm. So <F>urr</F> we decided to <F>ur</F> leave the place <SC>and</SC> <F>ur</F> by car. And we looked for a <F>ur</F> place to stay a night instead of the tent <SC>for</SC>. <F>Ur</F> And luckily, we came up on a hotel called Hotel Cosmos. So <F>ur</F> we <F>urm</F> decided to stay a night at this hotel. We <F>ur</F> were very fortunate <R>escape the</R> escape the night from storm. <CO><OL>Then</OL></CO>.O K.No. <nvs>laughter</nvs> No. <nvs>laughter</nvs> <F>Urr</F> <SC>Not</SC>.

But I didn't know that there're <F>ur</F> the heavy rain. <F>Urr</F>. So everyday, <R>it</R> it rains very hard in the tropical countries. And <SC>the about even</SC> <F>um</F> I didn't know that, and so <F>urm</F> <SC>every</SC> <F>er</F> the people in <F>er</F> those countries know that it rains <R>heavi</R> heavily in the evening. So they stay inside. But I was walking in the street. And all of the sudden, <F>ur</F> really all of the sudden, it started, <??></??> rain came. And then next second, <nvs>laughter</nvs> a heavy rain <??></??> I got drenched. And <R>I</R> <SC>I</SC> <SC>it was</SC> I was in the middle of the street, and there was <F>ur</F> very <??></??>.
