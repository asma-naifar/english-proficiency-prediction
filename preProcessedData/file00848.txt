So, for example, near my hometown, there is the fishing pond, and there is a wonderful view of islands.
So fish is very delicious. And it's a city about two hours from here by car. so it's a very countryside, but I really like it. so, now I live in Osaka, but, when I retire, I'd like to move back to my hometown

O K. when I was student, I played baseball from elementary school to university, so at that time, I was very famous baseball player. So, for example, when I was high school student, some professional baseball team's scout came to my school to check my performance.
, although they recommended me to join professional baseball team, I refused it because I really wanted to go to the university to play baseball at university league.
.
 I think so.
, because 
when I was
university, I played with Yoshinobu Takahashi who is one of the most famous baseball player .
So, at that time, everyone recognized my performance.
 was same as him.
So that's why I really wanted to join professional baseball team after I graduated university.
But, unfortunately, when I was freshman, I broke my shoulder
 to too much throwing.
So I have to give up .

 in off-days.
